===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-28 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the first quarter 2025 financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President, Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Senior Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; transaction-related expenses associated with completed acquisitions and lastly, financial impact associated with our minority investment in Indicor. Reconciliations can found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. As we turn to Page 4, you'll see the topics we plan to cover today. We'll start with our Q1 highlights, which included reviewing our most recent acquisition, CentralReach then we'll go through our segment results and a modestly improved outlook for the year and then get to your questions. Let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, let me highlight the four key takeaways for today's call. First, our quarterly financial results were solid with Q1 total revenue growing 12% and organic revenue growing 5% as expected and cash flow growing 12% over the last 12 months. Secondly, we successfully completed last week the acquisition of CentralReach, which I'll discuss in a bit. Third, given our solid start to the year and the completion of the CentralReach acquisition, we're raising our full year total revenue guidance and modestly increasing our full year debts outlook. And finally, we continue to be very well-positioned for capital deployment with more than $5 billion of available firepower over the course over the next 12 months. As we turn to Page 6. Allow me to remind everyone about the durability of our business model. As a cash flow compounder it is critical our underlying cash flow generation capability of our enterprise is, in fact, durable. While no business is immune from the current macroeconomic, trade and policy environment, we feel our enterprise is far better suited than most to withstand the uncertainty. To this end, over 85% of our revenues are generated in the U.S. and over 85% of our software revenues recur. Our enterprise solutions are mission-critical and this criticality is best demonstrated by our 95% gross retention. More importantly, we have a very efficient business model that long-term converts about 30% or a touch better of our revenue to free cash flow. All of this is further enhanced by our capital deployment optionality. So with this reminder, let's now discuss the newest acquisition to our family companies CentralReach. As we turn to Page 7, I'll start with what CentralReach does. CentralReach is the market-leading, cloud-native software solution that enables applied behavior analysis or ABA therapy providers to deliver care for individuals with autism spectrum disorder. On a daily basis, about 200,000 professionals use CentralReach's platform to perform their daily tasks such as setting up clients, running their practice, scheduling care, collecting clinical data and processing reimbursement claims. CentralReach’s offerings enable an overworked population of therapists to deliver more and better care to the autism community. This is all done in a cloud-native modern tech platform that utilizes GenAI on a robust basis. As it relates to the deal, we paid $1.65 billion, net of a $200 million tax benefit. We expect CentralReach to deliver about $175 million of revenue and $75 million of EBITDA for the TTM period ending June 2026. Further, we expect CentralReach’s revenue and EBITDA to continue to grow in the 20% area or a touch higher once it turns organic for reporting purposes. As you can see, CentralReach meets all of our long-standing acquisition criteria. Leader in niche market, competes on the basis of customer intimacy, has strong gross margins and converts high levels of cash flow. In addition, CentralReach reflects our new maturing leader criteria of being a higher growth business in this case in the 20% area. We financed the acquisition with our revolver and report the results in our Application Software segment. Now turning to Page 8, we'll briefly walk through the long-term drivers of CentralReach’s growth. As you can see at the top here, CentralReach is the leader in a market with strong sustainable tailwinds. First, there is a long-term persistent shortage of ABA therapists compared to patient demand. To scale this for you, for the U.S. alone, the current annual demand is approximately 900 million hours, where only about 300 million therapist hours are currently being supplied. We estimate the care gap to exist for the next decade both in the U.S. and throughout the developed world. And finally, CentralReach is winning with the winners, meaning their clients tend to be the industry aggregators, so CentralReach reaches customers grow, so does CentralReach. As we talked about on the prior page, CentralReachs solutions are mission critical to delivery of care. Their tools help measure outcomes, ensure compliance, and realized reimbursement. Perhaps more so, CentralReach's solutions unlock operational efficiencies, which allow for more care hours to be delivered to a grossly underserved patient population. Finally, CentralReach has multiple levers available to both grow revenue and expand margins. Some of these levers include expanding their product portfolio, cross-selling our new AI-powered solutions, continuing to win new logos, opportunistically pursuing adjacent markets such as speech and occupational therapies and bringing their solutions to international markets. Importantly, while we grow this business, we expect to see continued margin expansion. In short, this is a powerhouse business that is a critical solution to a huge challenge the world is facing. Through the CentralReach team, so excited for you to join Roper, thank you for all you do for the autism community and for trusting Roper to become your permanent partner. With that, let me turn the call over to Jason to talk through our P&L and our balance sheet. Jason?
Jason Conley: Thanks Neil and good morning everyone. As you heard from Neil, we had a good start to the year. Revenue of $1.9 billion was up 12% and led by an 8% contribution from acquisitions, mainly via our Transact and Procare portfolio additions organic growth of 5%. Coming into 2025, we expected Q1 to be our lowest quarter for organic growth, given some comp challenges in our network segment and so 5% was in line with that expectation. To click into the monthly cadence throughout the quarter, for software, enterprise bookings were up low single-digits in the quarter. This was expected following very strong Q4 performance across the portfolio. Importantly, pipelines remain healthy given the essential nature of our solutions. Yet we are cautiously optimistic and mindful of the current macro environment heading into Q2. For products, demand improved throughout the quarter, particularly at Neptune and Verathon without any indication of pull-forward activity. EBITDA of $740 million was up over 9% in total and nearly 10% on a segment basis. Reported EBITDA margin of 39.3% was down 90 basis points versus prior year. Core EBITDA margin, which exclude acquisitions, was solid at 4.8%, representing a 50 basis point margin expansion or 53% incrementals. Regarding acquisition margins, Q1 is Transact's lowest margin quarter as about half of Transact's EBITDA comes in the third quarter of each year. This is due to a high concentration of term renewals and back-to-school transaction volume. We'll expect margin expansion from Q1 as we progress throughout the year. For diluted EPS, we delivered $4.78, which was above our guidance range of $4.70 to $4.74 led by strong margin performance. Finally, on free cash flow, Q1 came in at $507 million, which was down 1% versus prior year. Note that this figure includes a legal settlement of $24 million, which was funded in January and we discussed in our last earnings call. Though Q1 free cash flow was a bit low, it was not unexpected, given the exceptionally strong Q4 working capital performance that discussed in our last call. Overall, free cash flow margins, if you look over the last few years, we've been in the 31% to 32% range. Last quarter, I had mentioned that we issued $2 billion of bonds in Q3 2024, yet the first coupon payments are occurring in February and April of this year. This, along with the legal settlement in Q1 has about a $70 million or 80 bps impact on free cash flow margins this year. Operationally, we feel good about working capital conversion and the structural free cash flow margin profile going forward. Now, I'll turn to Slide 10 to discuss our strong financial position. We finished the quarter with net debt to EBITDA of 2.4 times with a fully undrawn revolver. Last week, we closed on CentralReach and used the revolver to fund the acquisition. This brings our pro forma net leverage to around 3 times. As we roll forward our expected cash flow and leverage ratios, we remain in a great position even after funding CentralReach, over $5 billion of capacity to deploy towards high-quality acquisitions. To that end, we continue to work through a very strong pipeline of opportunities today. Given the uncertain macro backdrop, some PE sponsors are understandably taking a breath. However, as we have discussed, many PE sponsors need to return capital to LPs in the near future. And so the current market dislocation creates a favorable environment for Roper. In summary, our unique and resilient business model creates opportunity during times of uncertainty. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Neil. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Jason. As we turn to Page 12, let's review our Application Software segment. Revenue for the quarter grew 19% in total and organic revenue grew by 6%. The EBITDA margins were 41.4% and core margins improved 110 basis points in the quarter. This group of companies continues to demonstrate resilience and deliver on our growth expectations. As we turn to the businesses, we'll start with Deltek. Deltek grew in the mid-singles range in the quarter, both recurring and total revenues. As we highlighted on the slide, Deltek continues to have strong migration to their cloud offerings while the business continues to innovate at a rapid pace and has benefited by very strong gross and net retention. Aderant continues to be very strong with record first quarter bookings and strong cloud migration activity in the quarter. Aderant continues to gain market share and carry its momentum forward. PowerPlan also was outstanding in the quarter. Over the last several years, the team has done a great job at making the revenue stream more recurring in nature. In addition, they continue to get an amazing feedback with their cloud offerings, which are driving strong SaaS migration activity. Also during the quarter, we promoted Rafi Shure, Aderant's COO to succeed Joe Gomes as the next CEO of PowerPlan. Joe Gomes is now leading ProCare for us. We love seeing our high-potential leaders be placed in a position to have even higher levels of impact. Turning to Vertafore, which was once again steady and solid for us. We continue to see consistent ARR growth and strong customer retention here. ProCare, our platform acquisition from a year ago has done a nice job competing and winning in the market, increasing its market share versus the primary competitor. That said, there's a clear opportunity for the business to reach its full potential, both in terms of operational efficiency and growth. Because of this, we asked Joe Gomes, who has been a CEO within the Roper portfolio for eight years to lead ProCare going forward. We look forward to Joe replicating his prior Opera leadership success at ProCare. Finally, the combination between TransAct and CBORD is going according to our integration plan and the combined business is performing well in the market. Now turning to the outlook for the balance of the year. We see no change in the trajectory of the outlook and continue to expect to see organic growth in the mid-single plus range. Also, and as we highlighted last quarter, we want to remind you that TransAct's revenue, earnings and margin profile are highest in the third quarter, as Jason mentioned earlier. Please turn with us to Page 13. Organic revenue in our Network Software segment grew 1% in the quarter, as we expected, given the difficult prior year comp at MHA. EBITDA margins remained strong, 55.3%. As we dig into the individual businesses, we'll start with DAT. DAT grew in the quarter as expected based on increased ARPU driven by carrier and broker price actions, product packaging and continued customer cross-sell activity. In addition, DAT continues to innovate at a rapid pace and did a great job integrating our recent Trucker Tools bolt-on acquisition. For the balance of the year, we continue to expect to see DAT grow based on the price actions rolling into the recurring revenue. From a market point of view, spot market volumes and DAT monetize network participation continue to bounce along the bottom, which is what we expect to occur for the balance of the year. Both MHA and Foundry declined in the quarter as expected for MHA due to a prior year difficult comp and for Foundry due to the final elements of the actors and writers strike hangover. That said, we did see nice green shoot activity at Foundry during the quarter and now feel confident that the worst is behind and Foundry's ARR will, in fact, return to growth this year. ConstructConnect was strong for us in the quarter. The growth was fueled by strong customer bookings activity and improved customer retention. In addition, building on what Matt Strazza started, our new leader, Buck Brody, is doing a terrific job leaning into GenAI and developing very interesting, innovative and potentially groundbreaking products. We look forward to talking more about this in future calls. Finally, our alternate site healthcare businesses, SoftWriters and SHP, continue to grow nicely, winning in the marketplace. As we turn to the outlook, we continue to expect to see revenue growth in the mid-singles range for the balance of the year. Now please turn to Page 14, and let's review our TEP segment's full year results. Revenue here grew 6% on a total and organic basis, and EBITDA margins came in at 36.2%, solid results. Before we get into the business specifics, the vast majority of our tariff exposure resides within this segment. The good news is that most of our cross-border flows are USMCA compliant, which obviously mitigates most of the tariff impact. Our teams will continue to work this issue and further mitigate as needed. Though none of us are enjoying the continually evolving tariff situation, it is yet another example of the nimble execution capabilities of our organization. In March, when all the tariff noise started kicking up in earnest, our business leaders went to work to countermeasure the risk and start reworking the necessary supply chain activity. Nice job by the teams and keep up the great work. Now turning to Verathon. Verathon continues to be rock solid for us. Coming off an incredible 2024 in Q4, they did a nice job growing in Q1. The source of their strength remain consistent, their single-use bronchoscope or BFlex product leadership and their video laryngoscopy or GlideScope market leadership. Importantly, Verathon has built a true world-class new product development capability with several new product releases slated for this year. We look forward to talking about these new products as soon as they're launched. Turning to Neptune, which was just solid once again for us. They continue to do a great job with their ultrasonic meter go-to-market execution. Also and importantly, in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of a cloud-based utility building software solution for Neptune. The Neptune team has long crafted their strategy based on the unique unmet needs of their customers. From their market research and ongoing discussions with customers, it became abundantly clear that Neptune could solve a persistent industry problem by closing the loop in the meter to cash cycle. This acquisition provides Neptune with the final piece of this strategy. So we look forward to talking about the enhanced customer value by fully connecting the water meter read to data management to billing and collection processes. Special thanks to Don Deemer and the entire Neptune leadership team for completing this incredibly strategic acquisition, exciting stuff. Of note, both Verathon and Neptune order momentum improved as the quarter progressed. Turning to our CIVCO Medical Products business, they unfortunately declined in the quarter, based on a very difficult prior year comp. Finally, NDI nailed it in the quarter, and we need to brag on this business and the team for a bit. They have proprietary and world-class precision measurement technologies, used on healthcare applications worldwide. Over the past few years, the team has done an amazing job of hyper focusing on their medical markets and their OEM clients. In addition, they have built and are building a world-class go-to-market capability to match their product strength. Based on this, they're winning in important sub-markets within healthcare, namely orthopedic surgery, interventional radiology and cardiac ablation, great job, Dave and your entire team. Turning to the outlook for this segment, we continue to expect to see high single-digit revenue growth for the balance of year. So with that, please turn to Page 16. Let's turn to our Q2 and increased full year 2025 guidance. Given our solid Q1 start, the closing of our CentralReach acquisition, and our outlook for the balance of the year, we're increasing our total revenue growth outlook from 10% to be in the 12% area. Our organic growth rate of 6% to 7% for the full year remains unchanged. Finally, we're increasing our full year debt outlook by $0.01 on the low and high-end to be $0.1980 to $0.2005. Included in this outlook is $0.15 of CentralReach dilution. Our guide continues to assume a full year effective tax rate in the 21% to 22% area. For the second quarter, we expect adjusted debt to be between $480 million and $484 million and we are absorbing $0.05 of CentralReach dilution in the quarter. Now please turn us to Page 17, and then we'll open it up to your questions. We'll conclude with the same for key takeaways with which we started. First, our first quarter financial results were solid, and our businesses remain very resilient to the current trade and macroeconomic dynamics. Second, we successfully completed the acquisition of CentralReach. Third, given our solid start to the year and the completion of the CentralReach acquisition, we're modestly raising our full year guidance. And finally, we remain well positioned for capital deployment, where we continue to have more than $5 billion of available firepower over the course of next 12 months. Despite the macroeconomic uncertainties in the market, when it comes to acquisitions, Roper remains open for business. As it relates to our compounding model, we grew total revenue 12% and organic revenue 5% in the quarter and free cash flow of 12% over the last 12 months. We're delighted with our acquisition of CentralReach. As discussed, this vertical market leader is mission critical to the delivery of autism care and has several embedded structural growth drivers that will support its 20% revenue and EBITDA growth outlook. Finally, we continue to be very well positioned with more than $5 billion of available M&A firepower to deploy capital towards leading vertical market software businesses. Our M&A pipeline continues to be very active, our teams are engaged on several opportunities. It is always difficult to predict timing of deals, but we remain quite bullish on our ability to deploy capital this year. Keep in mind, at least historically, we have found times of uncertainty can be advantageous for deploying capital, think Verathon in the summer of 2020. As usual, we're excited to pursue these opportunities with our unbiased and disciplined approach. Now as we turn to your questions, and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic compounding flywheel, we'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over the long arc of time by executing a low risk strategy and running a dual threat offense. First, we have a proven, powerful business model that begins with operating a portfolio of market leading, application-specific, and vertically oriented business. Once a company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve their long-term and sustainable organic growth rates and underlying business quality. Second, we run a centralized, process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses in a deliberate and disciplined manner on cultivating, curating, and acquiring the next great vertical market leading business. To add to our cash flow compounding flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow over a long arc of time in the mid-teens area, meaning we double our cash flow every five years or so. With that, we'd like to thank you for your continued interest and support and open the floor to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Brent Thill: Good morning. Neil, curious to get your perspective on what's happening with PE and with the behavior, Jason mentioned some hesitancy. I think that makes sense. But maybe just give us a quick overview on what you're seeing.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Brent. Thanks. Thanks for joining this morning. Yes, what we're seeing in the deal. Well, you'd expect to see, by the way, with all the, you know, uncertainty generally as a slowdown. But what we're seeing on the ground with our pipeline, with our conversations with sponsors, investment bankers, companies is just a consistent drumbeat of activity. The pipeline is as robust as it's been. We're super pleased, obviously, that we got CentralReach done this year. We still have 5 billion to deploy over the next 12 months or so. But we would sort of have our - what we're seeing at the high level, just a general macro uncertainty disconnect. What we're seeing at the on the ground level. So we'll just have to see how it plays out in terms of the balance of the year. But we're certainly cautiously optimistic. And as we said in the prepared remarks, you know, times of uncertainty oftentimes in our history or, you know, present very unique opportunities to deploy capital.
Brent Thill: Great. Quick follow-up just on Deltek on the Fed exposure. Can you help us understand what you're seeing there? And if you've given up the percent exposed in that sector would be helpful. Thanks.
Neil Hunn: Yes, sure. Happy to do that. So Deltek’s 60 of their business is focused on helping federal government contractors run their business, 40% are on other professional services-oriented markets. The broader - it's a broad set of activities that has created amount of uncertainty in the government contracting part of the Deltek customer base. It's obviously DOGE, but it's the budget uncertainty. It's the government shutdown, the debt ceiling, all of that taken together, as you'd expect, creates a fair amount of uncertainty. So what happens in that uncertainty is the pipeline pushes to right at touch, as we've seen this since we owned this business since 2016, and so we've seen this pattern play out before, so things push to the right at touch. The customer sentiment when we talked with our leadership team there during our quarterly call downs is actually quite good. They feel like this is a short-term speed bump versus any medium or long-term concern. And what happens when the pipeline pushes to the right, Deltek's growth rate just slows a touch. Deltek will grow this year, but we probably will take a point - or we have taken a point or two of growth off the Deltek's organic growth rate for this year given the uncertainty.
Jason Conley: Yes. It's more acute too because the GovCon Enterprise segment is mostly - if they're doing expansions or add-ons, it's mostly through perpetual licenses, so that will impact in year.
Brent Thill: Great. Thanks.
Jason Conley: You bet.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Brad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. As it relates to free cash flow and operating cash flow, should we expect a return to growth here in June? Or is it more back-end weighted?
Jason Conley: Yes. Thanks for the call, Brad. It's going to be more back-end weighted. Q2 for us, I mentioned on the prepared remarks we had. We haven't done bonds in a few years. So we did our first offering Q3 of last year and some of the coupon payments aren't due until April. And so we just got a little bit of a timing between P&L interest and cash interest. So that will impact the second quarter. Also just noting, the second quarter is usually our lowest quarter of the year because we made two federal tax payments. But then as we roll through to the second half, you're right, it will be a very strong Q3. We have our Transact business will have a full quarter of that. They get most of their EBITDA and cash flow in the third in the third quarter. Our frontline business is particularly strong in the third quarter as well. So expect a better second half than a first half.
Brad Reback: That's great. And then just real quick on CentralReach. Given that there are 200,000 providers on the platform, does the gross retention rate look a little different here than maybe other aspects of the software business?
Jason Conley: Yes. It does a bit. If you think about it just customer only logo only, it's in the mid- to high 90s. But when you add to your point, some of the therapists that come in and out of the market, then it's more of a sort of a low 90s gross retention, but we get that back on the net retention, right? We get as the market consolidates - and those go to the winners, we get that through net retention. So net retention is kind of 115 to 120 range. So that's kind of how we think about it.
Brad Reback: Great. Thanks very much.
Jason Conley: You bet.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Joshua Tilton: Hi, guys, can you hear me?
Jason Conley: We can. Good morning.
Joshua Tilton: Good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Maybe just to start, I guess I just want to take it back and be a little high level. I guess, I heard a lot on the call the word uncertainty, but I also heard a lot on the call the word durability, and you guys do believe that all the businesses are pretty durable even in the current environment. I guess, can you just help us high level understand in the context of your decision to pretty much reiterate the guidance on the top line? Like, where are there some offsetting puts and takes in the guidance that maybe either give you or don't give you some wiggle room if the macro gets worse from here or maybe even better just to start. Thank you.
Jason Conley: Well, you're right. I mean I think the durability gave us confidence to reiterate. The puts and takes, I'd say, we just talked about Deltek might be a little bit weaker, but you've got other businesses that had strong bookings that are materializing in terms of recurring revenue throughout the year. So in AS, we're sort of holding serve there. I'd say at NS, pretty much the same holding serve. We talked about how DAT is going to improve throughout the year. We still believe that to be the case. Foundry saw some green shoots, as Neil talked about. And so we expect that business to exit in sort of the high single-digit range, somewhere in there. And then really within TEP, there hasn't been a lot at the top level, but I would say our MDI business certainly has some good tailwinds, some of these new indications that there they've been targeting for years in terms of cardiac ablation and orthopedics have taken hold. So, I'd say that got us confident in maintaining our guidance for the year.
Joshua Tilton: Super helpful. And then maybe just a little more nuanced follow-up to that. Can you just talk of the durability of Deltek maybe specifically for the third quarter, just how you think about it throughout the rest of the year? I know you guys gave some high-level commentary on the moving pieces in that business there, but maybe how we should think about your visibility into that business and then just durability as we move throughout the year.
Neil Hunn: I mean, Deltek is 80% to 85% recurring, which gives you an amazing amount of predictability and durability as Jason alluded. There's a little bit of perpetual that, that business still has that we've trimmed off a little bit. As I mentioned, that's essentially what's driving our slightly lower growth outlook for the total year. And we'll stop short of giving you any quarterly sort of specifics on individual businesses.
Joshua Tilton: I'll try it. But I appreciate it. Thank you so much.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joseph Vruwink with Baird. Please go ahead.
Joseph Vruwink: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess when thinking about confidence for the remainder of the year, bookings for software order patterns for products are about as good as it gets when thinking about leading indicators. Maybe beyond what you have in hand, what's been the perspective within businesses that are more reliant on cloud or subscription transitions, that would seem to be maybe something that's a slightly harder proposition relative to the businesses where when renewals are coming due and you can make an assumption for renewal rates, are there any indications around the transition oriented revenues where maybe customer preference could slow if the macro remains uneasy out there.
Jason Conley: Yes. Thanks for the question, Joe. So, Adonis our kind of our leader in this - in the pack in terms of cloud transition. And actually, Q1 was very strong for them. And they're starting to actually move into the higher end of the client base in terms of cloud transition. So didn't see any indications I understand your point, and we didn't see it there, maybe at Deltek, but that's not as much of a tailwind for them. And so that kind of is in the sort of uncertainty bucket with DOGE, but that will happen eventually. Otherwise, yes, we didn't see.
Neil Hunn: Our plan had a nice quarter.
Jason Conley: Yes, actually great. Great point. So PowerPlan just launched their tax for fixed asset product about two quarters - one or two quarters ago. Saw really good uptick there. The recurring revenue is now growing double digits as a result of that. So yes, nothing that we could see in terms of transition to the cloud and slowing customer decision, we didn't see any of that.
Joseph Vruwink: Okay. That's great. And then you kind of touched on this with Deltek, but extending more broadly. How would you frame a stress test around the nonrecurring elements of both AS and it could decline be possible there? And I know it's a mix. I'll throw in reoccurring to this question. So you have a mix of perpetual license, I would assume very high margins, but then also services and payments. Is the profit margin implication if the nonrecurring pieces are declining to imagine it's probably good for your margin mix, just kind of a framing there?
Jason Conley: I think the perpetual and the service are fairly offsetting relative to recurring - relative to SaaS subscription. So I don't think we'll have any meaningful margin impact there. Network, our nonrecurring is really small, so it's not as significant. I think it is a question in terms of - in AS, that's probably the only area that has some question in terms of where it's going to be this year. It's probably going to be up a little bit. That's at least our current thinking, but we'll see how the year plays out.
Joseph Vruwink: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Terry Tillman: Yes. Hi, Neil, Jason and Zack. Thanks for taking my question and follow-up. The first one just relates to the central reach. We enjoyed reading the 2025 market report they put out. I think it said 75% of customers are purchasing AI solutions. I'm curious, I know you just brought this into the fold, but is the AI-driven revenue meaningful at all at this point for CentralReach? And are you seeing some of that kind of AI attach rate yet on any of the other app software products? And then I have a follow-up.
Neil Hunn: Yes, sure. So the CentralReach AI products are new to the market. I mean, they're new in the last 12 months and that there's three essentially buckets of products and that they didn't all get released nine or 12 months ago, it's been a rolling release. So no, we've got a - it's not a material amount of revenue for CentralReach, but it is one of their meaningful growth drivers going forward that the company - both the company and we are excited about. And to your second part of that question - the second part of your question about the rest of Roper, it's - I would say CentralReach is leading relative to the Roper portfolio, but my guess is the balance of the portfolio will catch up quickly in the first derivative of AI, sort of the GPT that ride along with our products or the fraud exposure that was sort of mitigated at DAT, those sorts of applications. We've done a very good job. Now we're - as most companies are pivoting as a second derivative, which we think is a huge TAM expander for us. This is where you get the genetic digital employees, so our companies are very, very busy extending our software with the Agentic capability into the workflows of our customers. We expect to monetize those on a work completed basis. So we're very excited about that. But it's still pretty early, but it's moving at a very, very quick clip.
Terry Tillman: Got it. Thanks. Another me to cut you off, Neil. Just a follow-up question relates to core EBITDA margin for you, Jason. I think it was up 50 bps in the first quarter. How do we think about core EBITDA margins for the year, realizing you have another acquisition that's in the mix now? Thanks.
Jason Conley: Yes. I think the core EBITDA margins will be, I think, up a little bit this year at the segment level, right? And then we've got - probably with the Corp G&A, it's more flattish if you include that, but still strong. I think we had a good - in terms of AS. I think acquisition margins are going to get better throughout the year, and core will sort of hold, network will probably get a little bit better in the second half just through scale. And then TEP had a good quarter. We think that's going to continue throughout the year just with MDI and some of Verathon's products coming to market.
Terry Tillman: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ken Wong with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Ken Wong: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You guys mentioned Deltek pushed a little to the right. As you look across your portfolio and you think through customer sales conversations, any other areas where you're seeing some modest shift to the right?
Neil Hunn: Not really. I mean, we studied that intently and intensely, as we went through our quarterly reviews and really look for it, it was clear at Deltek. It was just not clear other places. It doesn't mean that it might not happen a little bit, but it hasn't happened here yet.
Jason Conley: Yes. I would say, I mean, Aderant had the highest bookings quarter they've ever had. Strata had a phenomenal quarter in terms of TCV, total contract value, which will benefit us over several years, but they had a really good quarter. Vertafore was a little soft, but they had an exceptionally strong Q4. So we weren't surprised to see a little bit of year-over-year weakness there.
Neil Hunn: We talked about ConstructConnect, we talked about talked about foundry. We software SHP pipeline was fine in the quarter, so.
Ken Wong: Got it. And I guess, should you happen to see some erosion going forward? Help us think through, I guess, what are the counterplay countermeasures that you guys are thinking about? Would it be more margin defensive? Or are there particular actions that you guys would potentially implement to try to maintain growth? What would be your next step should something emerge?
Jason Conley: Yes. So I think for us, we have this natural incentive for the businesses. They usually are very thoughtful about the pacing of investment. And so if they start to see some weakness, it's in their best interest to make sure that they're being prudent. Obviously, making the right investments and we're very transparent with areas they should not be cutting, but they naturally have that in their P&L. And also, I'd just say the incentives are variable to throughout the company. And so it's based on growth. So we get some of that margin preservation there as well.
Ken Wong: Perfect. Thanks guys.
Jason Conley: You bet.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Davis: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Jason Conley: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis: Hi, I just wanted to clarify because we just, kind of, glossed over it a little bit, but it sounds like tariffs are a big kind of nothing burger for you guys and seems somewhat isolated to Verathon. Is that a fair statement?
Neil Hunn: I wouldn't say it's isolated to Verathon. It's - most of the product business in the TEP segment have to deal with some amount of tariff impact, but the vast majority, Neptune, Verathon, SIFCO is USMCA compliant. So that's why we're able to sort of be - sort of a $10 million to $15 million issue.
Scott Davis: Okay. Fair enough. All right. And moving to something more important. The poor activity that we're seeing just seems like it could be hitting an air pocket, maybe in 2Q or later in 2Q, you don't seem to be concerned about the freight activity kind of different when that occurs. Is there a particular - are you guys less exposed? I suppose that the - at ports as otherwise for DAT?
Neil Hunn: So we're watching it, as you'd expect, on a daily - a weekly basis when we look at the metrics, Scott, I think that maybe the simplest way to think about it is the paying or the monetized part of the DAT network on the carrier side, flexes but not like day-to-day to demand, right? And so if there was, for instance, in March, if there was a pull forward across the economy for pre-tariff shipping, we do not see a surge in carrier demand in the network. Just like if there's a little bit of slack in the system, we won't see it immediately turn off. Now if it sustained that way for 6 months to 12 months, then we would expect to see an impact on the carrier side of the network. But so we just have assumed going into the beginning of the year sort of flattish on the carrier volume units, and that's where we are maintaining it. DAT will grow this year because of the price actions, and we'll see how things play out from here.
Scott Davis: Okay. Good color. Thank you for sharing. Good luck guys.
Neil Hunn: You bet.
Scott Davis: I will pass it on.
Neil Hunn: Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: You bet, Dr. Dray. How are you?
Deane Dray: Doing really well. Thank you. So I want to circle back on CentralReach, and it's a bit unusual. I mean it's a good problem to have to explain. You don't typically get a business with this type of growth profile. Often, PE has public company aspirations for someone at a 20% growth plus. So - just how was this available? And what percent of the funnel have these kind of growth profile for you?
Neil Hunn: Yes. So on sort of how did this come about? I would say it was a very traditional process for us. This was a business that was owned by Incyte. We've known the Incyte team for a while. It was Jan and her team about a year ago. We're talking with Incyte. This wasn't about this asset. We had an opportunity to meet the CEO plus or minus a year ago. We started doing our proprietary market work. You know nine months ago or so, we liked a lot of the structural elements of the market, the growth drivers. They're solving a real problem in society, we see AI, GenAI as a strong tailwind with very limited sort of headwind or risk associated with it in this end market. And then the process started in a very, very traditional way with an investment bank. It was competitive. But as we've been able to do in the last handful of deals, we've really been able to articulate the Roper value proposition to the management team, right? So what is life like inside Roper, the advantages of having permanent long-term forever capital, the way you can grow your business inside of that, and in this case, there were many LOI submitted, but because we had one management, we were able to get the call back and have the opportunity to essentially have a week to finish the transaction, which we did. So we're very excited by that, the process, the way that it unfolded. In terms of what's in the pipeline, the vast - I mean the vast majority of the funnel, are these maturing leader type businesses. The growth rates are going to range between 10% and 25%. This doesn't mean that every deal has to be in the 20s. But Deane, as you know, what we're solving for here in our revised capital deployment strategy is sort of 30% or 40% better returns in year five. And we can get there. We can solve for that a couple of different ways, but the opportunities in the market that are plentiful, these more higher growing businesses to help solve for that, where you get both the growth and the benefit of margin expansion over time.
Jason Conley: I'd also just say in terms of funnel, we have a very good mix also of bolt-ons, right? So we've been really active on the bolt-on front, and I continue to see that as well.
Deane Dray: Got it. And just to confirm here, does CentralReach, is it accretive to CRI on a total company basis? And at what point does that contribution become positive?
Neil Hunn: It is working capital. CentralReach is working capital negative. And what's important for us through our CRI lens is that we just remain negative from a working capital point of view. So the incremental transaction doesn't have to be incrementally negative to the fleet. It just has to make sure we stay negative.
Deane Dray: Got it. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: You bet.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Hi guys. Good morning.
Jason Conley: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Giordano: Can you just walk me through the guide mechanics like the walk from prior to current like your small beat in the quarter versus guide, hold do organic. You absorbed $0.15 and still raising. Like is there kind of a contingency that was being removed like where’s the offset here?
Jason Conley: Yes. I think you've characterized it right. We had a little bit of margin and a little bit of interest contingency in our last guide. And so, I talked about all the things that are sort of holding within AS. Deltek is a little bit weaker, but others are offsetting that and us is about on - as we talked about probably a little bit better on margin, I would say, versus our last guide. So that's what gets you to the revised pretty much updated guidance that flows through the Q1 beat.
Joe Giordano: Okay. That makes sense. And obviously, I've been getting a lot of calls on Deltek as far as what the exposure is. I mean you've talked about it a lot on this call, so we don't want to go crazy here. But has that been primary DOGE risk kind of like done now? Like if Musk is going back to Tesla and we haven't seen these big changes to these businesses yet, like we not just - could we stop worrying that it's happening?
Neil Hunn: I think, again, I said it earlier, I just - I don't want to characterize this as just a DOGE thing. I mean it's DOGE ,but what our pattern recognition of owning this business is 2016 is when there is a potential government shutdown and the budget uncertainty that, too, is like just people don't know where the spending is going to be at the period, right? So, it's all of this that's blended together has created the uncertainty. But this community of government contractors provide essential services to the government. And so that's why we think this is a short-term thing and not a structural or even a medium-term thing. And I think the most recent, if you just go to DOGE, I think the most recent conversations are, we're sort of stuck at $160 million or $170 billion, and people are going to take that as a win, as opposed to try to get to the $1 trillion or whatever the number is going to be. And then obviously, with must-spending more of this time going back to his other day jobs and having the limited number of days and as government sort of contractors, government employment status, will certainly probably slow down the DOGE impact.
Joe Giordano: Yes, that makes sense. Great, thanks guys. Appreciate it.
Neil Hunn: You bet.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Steve Tusa: Hi, good morning.
Neil Hunn: Hi, good morning Steve.
Steve Tusa: Just on the organic, maybe some color on the 2Q organic. And then secondarily on education, there's obviously a lot going on there as well with the government and how they're kind of pressuring some of these higher ed organizations. And anything there that you guys are seeing as well?
Neil Hunn: I'll let Jason take the first. I'll take your education question.
Jason Conley: Yes. I mean I think we're going to - it will step up from Q1 a bit. It's - I think AS will have a little bit of increase, just as you see Procare rolling in. Obviously, NS is going to go up to mid-singles as we talked about at the beginning of the year with just DAT and foundry ramping, and we don't have the MHA comp issue and then high single-ish range probably for TEP, just with all the things we've talked about, it's true for Q2 as well.
Steve Tusa: Got it.
Neil Hunn: And Department of Education and education, generally, it's - there's noise in the system, but when you read through what the administration is thinking about doing at Department of Education, it's essentially not cutting funding. It's just block granting the funding down to the states. If you look at the 2025 CR Department of Education funding equals 2024. The Title I sort of funding is like 80% by the way, and the President and the Secretary on repeat have said that's not going to be touched in terms of the total amount. There's certainly some pressure on DEI and sort of the conflict in Maine on some of the athletes and whatnot about holding back funding. But I think those are bespoke issues. The big overarching thing is the funding dollars are not going to change, just maybe the administration of the funding dollars might change going forward. So, we haven't heard - there's been no like slowdown or panic at the customer level about their funding.
Steve Tusa: Okay. And then just lastly, just in April here, the software bookings. Have you actually seen acceleration from the low single-digit?
Jason Conley: We don't get that information.
Steve Tusa: Okay, great. Thanks for the detail.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to follow up a little bit on the organic sales sort of acceleration you've dialed in. So, I guess you grew total company 5% organic Q1, I think it's 5% organic over the last 12 months. And it seems that sort of enterprise software bookings a little slow to start the year. I think the backlog at TEP was down 40% or so in December. So I just wondered sort of the assumption of an acceleration to maybe 8% plus growth in the back half, the confidence there? And is there anything outside of foundry that's turning around a lot?
Jason Conley: Well, I mean, I think we just - we start with network. I mean, foundry, obviously, but then DT as well. I mean we're assuming carriers are going to be flat. But even despite that, we're expecting the business to get better throughout the year and have a decent ex velocity. We talked about TAP already, I think, which is really just Neptune continuing to get better throughout the year. They have an easy comp in the third quarter, if you recall, and then we talked about NDI being another component of TEP that's given us confidence in the guidance there.
Neil Hunn: The other thing I'd say, Julian, is as it relates to the bookings activity, on a trailing 12 months bookings activity is up low double digits. And it takes time for that bookings activity to work its way into revenue. So that's in the machine and converting to revenue as we speak. So we have broad tailwind strength on bookings activity, Q4 is amazing. Q3 was a little bit slower as we expected. So I would not read too much just listening to your question, I would not read too, I think you're reading too much into a Q1 booking number because you really have to look at what the buildup of the bookings is that sort of feed the machine.
Julian Mitchell: That's helpful. Thank you. And then just my follow-up would be on the application software EBITDA margin. So you had this sort of 30 bps headwind, I guess, to the EBITDA margin year-on-year in first quarter. How are you sort of thinking about that play out over the balance of the year as sort of CentralReach come in? And is that core OMX you had 100 bps or so a good run rate for the rest of the year?
Jason Conley: So yes, I think as - I'm just trying to parse out what you're saying here. I think on the core basis, we should see margin expansion this year, maybe not as much we saw in the first quarter, but certainly up nicely. We talked about Deltek targeted restructuring last year. We've seen some benefits of that this year. And then the acquisition margins, I talked about, let's just kind of take park CentralReach to the side for a second. Those will get better throughout the year because you've got a ramping of activity at ProCare and then you've got TRANZACT having a seasonally strong third quarter and actually better second quarter than first quarter. So that will get better throughout the year. And then CentralReach, to your point, will come in at sort of low 40s EBITDA margins. So that will benefit
Neil Hunn: And Deltek has got a benefit this year because of EBITDA - they did a belt tightening in Q4, which carries through for the full year.
Julian Mitchell: That's great. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: You bet.
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: And the conference call has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-01-30 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Senior Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, transaction-related expenses associated with completed acquisitions, a charge related to the settlement of the PowerPlan 2020 litigation matter, and lastly, financial impacts associated with our minority investments. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. Now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our fourth quarter and full year results with you this morning. As we turn to Page 4, you'll see the topics we plan to cover today. We'll start by highlighting our strong fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial and operating performance. We'll then go through results in greater detail, review our balance sheet, including our M&A capacity and discuss our very impressive cash flow growth and performance. Then we'll discuss our segment highlights and introduce our 2025 and Q1 guidance. After closing remarks, we'll open up the call for your questions. So, let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, we want to highlight the three key takeaways for today's call. First, our cash flow growth was strong, once again demonstrating our consistent and durable compounding capability. Second, we entered 2025 with improving momentum. And third, we now have over $5 billion of acquisition firepower at a time when the M&A markets are becoming increasingly more attractive. Now as it relates to our cash flow compounding capability, 2024 was another example of how our model works. We grew revenue 14% in the year, which was nicely balanced between organic and inorganic contributions, and deployed $3.6 billion towards market-leading vertical software businesses, headlined by our acquisitions of Procare and Transact Campus. Of note, our 2024 cohort of acquisitions not only meet all our historical criteria, but also meets our higher growth and higher returns ambitions. As a result, we grew free cash flow 16% for the year, topping $2 billion for the first time in our history with free cash flow margins of 32%, another great year and our long history of cash flow compounding. As we look to 2025, we're excited to talk through the positive momentum we're experiencing. First, we're seeing accelerating demand for our mission-critical solutions broadly across our businesses. Specifically, throughout 2024, our enterprise bookings accelerated, ending in the high-teens growth area in Q4. This bookings momentum combined with consistently high gross and net retention supports the continued growth and expansion in high singles area for a $4.6 billion base of software recurring and reoccurring revenues. Given this, we're initiating our 2025 total revenue guide to be north of 10% with organic revenue growth in the 6% to 7% range with adjusted DEPS between $19.75 and $20. On the capital deployment front, our disciplined approach will greatly benefit our company and our shareholders this year. Specifically, we now have over $5 billion of available M&A firepower. This is particularly important given the backdrop of the current M&A market, one that is poised for high levels of deal activity over the next couple of years and more on this later. Great year team and look forward to seeing you at our leadership meeting next week. I'd like to ask everyone to turn to Page 6, where we'll discuss our long-term growth algorithm. In March of '23, we concluded our first ever Investor Day with the components of our long-term mid-teens cash flow growth algorithm as you see here on the left. As you compare our '24 performance on the right-hand sides of this, you'll note we're right in line with our strategy, namely posting 14% revenue growth, 41% core margin leverage, and adding 800 basis points of growth through our capital deployment capability. This all yields 16% cash flow growth. Importantly, 2023's performance was quite similar with 15% revenue growth, solid operating leverage, and consistently good cash flow growth. We execute our algorithm by running a dual-threat offense, namely, first, driving consistent and improving levels of leveraged organic growth and second, deploying the enterprise's capital towards the best ideas that we consistently cultivate and execute upon. Importantly, as we do this, we not only grow, but we improve the underlying quality of our enterprise and our portfolio across several dimensions, including growth, the level of recurring revenue and asset intensity. In short, this is how our model works. 2024 is no exception, a year where our say-do ratio was quite high and importantly, we have strong momentum heading into '25. So, with that, Jason, let me turn the call over to you, so you can walk through our quarterly and full-year results. Jason?
Jason Conley: Thanks, Neil. Let's turn to page 7. We had an excellent finish to 2024 with Q4 being our highest revenue quarter of the year at 16%, bringing us just -- to just under $1.9 billion. Acquisitions contributed a solid 9% as a full quarter of Transact is flowing through, along with sequential gains realized at Procare. Organic revenue grew 7%, with our software segments coming in line with expectations and our tech segment slightly outperforming as I'll discuss shortly. EBITDA of $744 million was 13% over prior year and represented 39.6% of revenue. Core EBITDA margin, which excludes the impact from our 2024 acquisitions, was down 30 basis points compared to prior year. Of note, some of our software businesses, mainly within our AS segment took $9 million of targeted and opportunistic restructuring actions, which they absorbed in the fourth quarter and which will better position these businesses going forward. DEPS of $4.81 was above our guidance range of $4.70 to $4.74 despite the costs associated with the restructuring. So, all in, a very good quarter. Now, we'll flip to Page 8, where I'll briefly cover our Q4 segment performance. Application Software posted 24% revenue growth with an 18% contribution from acquisitions and 6% from organic growth. Importantly, organic recurring and reoccurring revenue grew 8% in the quarter and the year, led by double-digit SaaS growth as customers move from on-premise to the cloud. EBITDA margin of 41.5% includes our 2024 acquisitions that come into Roper at lower margin, but provide greater opportunity for margin expansion over time. Core margin is 30 basis points over prior year on a comparative basis. Turning to Network Software, revenue growth of 3% was in line with expectations and an improvement over the last couple of quarters as our freight match business returned to growth. Neil will unpack the dynamics of 2025, but we expect the segment to post mid-single-digit growth in the year with exit velocity above that range. EBITDA margin here was a spectacular 57.4% in the quarter. DEPS finished strong with 12% revenue growth in the quarter. Verathon capped off a terrific year with record revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. Also, Neptune had outstanding operational execution across both mechanical and ultrasonic product lines. And EBITDA margin here was 20 -- 120 basis points over prior year at 34.8%. All right. Now, we'll turn to Page 9, where we'll look at the full year results. All in all, this was a great year for Roper. We delivered on our long-term growth algorithm with mid-teens revenue and free cash flow growth. This is underpinned by a balanced contribution of acquisition and organic revenue growth, which combined came in at 14% to print at just over $7 billion of revenue, a new milestone for Roper. Our disciplined capital deployment strategy generates consistent and repeatable performance, which has been demonstrated over time and is what our investors can expect going forward. Organic growth is also repeatable and fortified and we're well positioned for further improvement. As Neil mentioned, we ended the year with $4.6 billion of software recurring and reoccurring revenue that we expect to organically grow in the high single-digit range in 2025. Further, it's a good time to remind everyone that over 85% of our revenue is in the US, which limits currency and potential tariff risk, while capturing domestic opportunities that lie ahead. EBITDA of over $2.8 billion was 13% versus prior year with EBITDA core margin consistent with the prior year. So, clicking into margins and operating leverage a bit. Core segment operating leverage was strong at 49% and including corporate G&A was 41%. We made significant progress in 2024 to build out expanded capital deployment and growth capabilities. So, we see that continuing in 2025, but then moderating in 2026 and beyond with a return to leverage on corporate G&A. Most importantly, free cash flow was outstanding in 2024, as Neil had mentioned, coming in at nearly $2.3 billion and up 16% or $320 million over prior year with 32% free cash flow margins. We finished the year above expectations, which positions us quite well going into 2025. And just looking back since 2021, our free cash flow has compounded 14% if adjusted for Section 174 that went into effect in 2022. We are really pleased with the steady and consistent growth in cash flow. And as we move forward, we expect free cash flow margins of 30% or more. So, beyond the numbers you see here, we see great things happening within Roper. We have significantly enhanced and expanded our capital deployment team and processes. Additionally, our multi-year focus on talent is really taking shape as we're feeling the best business leaders in our history. And now we're starting to see those leaders hire great leaders. This is resulting in more data-driven strategies and more deeply connected operating plans that give us confidence and long-term acceleration of organic growth. Reflecting on my 18 years with Roper, I can say this is a banner year for both strategic and operating progress. Now, let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss our balance sheet. As I mentioned earlier, Q4 free cash flow was better than expected with 15% growth over prior year. Additionally, we exited our minority position in Certinia this quarter. As a reminder, Certinia is a professional services automation software company. We partnered with PE firm [Haveli] (ph) to execute on a successful first chapter of a value creation plan. And in exiting our position, we received $246 million of proceeds, which is a 2x multiple of our invested capital over a 14-month period. So, a terrific financial outcome and a great learning opportunity to apply as we look at businesses that have higher growth profiles and profitability improvement potential. Thank you to the team at Haveli for the opportunity to partner and learn. At quarter-end, our net leverage was 2.6 times and as of today, we have near full access to our $3.5 billion revolver. So, this plus our strong projected cash flow provides us with over $5 billion that we can deploy toward high-quality acquisition opportunities this year. And just to note, 2024 market activity was a little quieter than we originally expected. Despite this, we were able to deploy $3.6 billion for some great vertical market software businesses, highlighted by Procare and Transact. In 2025, we believe the logjam should break free from our direct conversations with PE sponsors and from what many are stating publicly, there is a pressing need to provide liquidity to limited partners. Therefore, we anticipate being very busy this year on the deal front. So, with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Jason. As we turn to Page 12, let's review our Application Software segment. Revenue for the year grew by 21% in total and organic revenue grew by 6%. EBITDA margins were 43% and core margins improved 40 basis points in the year. We like what we're seeing across the businesses and the segment. From a market perspective, we exit '24 in a much improved state and enter '25 with momentum, which is highlighted by our second half organic bookings growing solidly in the double-digit area. In addition, the recurring revenue base and retention levels remain quite healthy here. Another thing we like across this segment is the amount of business and talent building that occurred throughout the year. For example, Deltek made meaningful investments in their cloud tech stack, specifically with GenAI investments and saw meaningful improvement in enterprise bookings during the second half of the year. Importantly, this all occurred during our planned and scheduled CEO succession from Mike Corkery to Bob Hughes. Similarly, Aderant was super good throughout 2024, while furthering their product lead with meaningful GenAI deployments and cloud migration activity. In 2024, Aderant was our leading net retention business, reflecting their strong market position, innovation capabilities and strong customer intimacy. Vertafore was superb in delivering their enterprise capabilities to the largest customers in the market while seeing compelling and steady bookings throughout the year, leading to consistently strong ARR growth. As it relates to PowerPlan, Joe and the team there did an excellent job deploying their first cloud-native product and migrating several critical industry-leading customers to this product. As a result, PowerPlan's ARR growth was the best in its history as the market continues to respond to PowerPlan's innovation. As discussed at the onset of the call, we successfully deployed $3.6 billion towards vertical market software acquisitions with the largest two being Procare and Transact Campus, both rolling up into this segment. Both are off to a solid start and we look forward to their meaningful contributions to the segment and the enterprise in the many years to come. Remaining businesses in this segment posted solid organic gains. Great job by our leaders and teams in this group throughout '24. We're proud of you and your accomplishments. Now turning to the outlook for '25, we expect to see consistent levels of organic growth towards the higher end of the mid-singles range. For the first quarter, we expect margins for this segment to be down year-over-year on a reported basis, similar to Q4 as Transact Campus acquisition revenues come in at a seasonally lower rate. Please turn with us to Page 13. Organic revenue in our Network Software segment grew 3% for 2024. As we've discussed all year, our network growth rate was impacted by the market in our freight matching businesses and the riders and actor strikes related to Foundry. Excluding these businesses, the segment grew in the mid-singles area, which demonstrates the underlying quality of this group. EBITDA margins continued to be strong at 56.1%. Similar to that of our Application Software segment, we're excited by the progress made across this group of businesses. For example, while DAT navigated difficult freight market conditions, Jeff Clementz, our new DAT leader, did a tremendous job advancing the tech stack and market position of DAT. Of note, our network has never been more resilient and the threat from fraudulent actors has been meaningfully mitigated. During the fourth quarter, we completed the DAT bolt-on acquisition Trucker Tools. Trucker Tools is a perfect complement to DAT's offering, providing real-time visibility to the DAT network participants. As a reminder, DAT's strategy is to capitalize on its market leadership, providing continually increasing value to both sides of the freight network, helping to drive higher retention and enhanced network monetization. Very similar story at Foundry. While a difficult financial year due to the market conditions related to the strikes, Foundry continued to innovate at an accelerated pace with particular focus on GenAI and computational AI based features. This is one of the significant benefits of the Roper operating model. When one of our businesses hits a market issue, we continue to invest, if not accelerate investment, so we can be the primary market share benefactors when the market recovers, and this was certainly the case with DAT and Foundry in 2024. We like what we saw across the balance of the companies here. By pipeline, aggressively upgraded their talent, better aligned their organizational structure with their customers' needs and had very solid ARR growth in 2024. ConstructConnect, where we executed another planned succession to Buck Brody as Matt Strazza took the reins at Frontline was super in the year. This organization continues to be a learning organization, improving lead-generation quality and conversions, which led to solid revenue and ARR growth. Importantly, ConstructConnect is building a set of potentially transformative products leveraging AI technologies. Finally, the alternate site healthcare software businesses were once again solid in the year. As we turn to the outlook, we expect to see revenue growth improve to be in the mid-singles range for the full year, benefited by DAT’s network value capture and consistent performance across the remainder of this group. Given improvement throughout the year, we expect our 2025 organic exit run rate to be north of the mid-singles area. Organic revenue growth in the first quarter will be a bit lower than the full-year in the low-singles range given the Q1 comp created by MHA a year ago. Prior to turning to our tech segment, we'd like to spend a moment talking about the significant strides we made with our GenAI development and deployment over the last year. As you know, each of our businesses primarily competes on the notion of customer intimacy. This intimacy or super deep knowledge of our customers' businesses, needs, and workflows is the unique and competitively differentiated advantage of Roper and our businesses. Now that GenAI LLMs are improving in fidelity and becoming increasingly more commoditized and cost effective, we are laser focused on combining our intimacy, deep reservoir of data and these GenAI technologies to innovate and deliver compelling solutions and we made meaningful steps in this direction in 2024. To name some, GenAI product assistance at Deltek and Aderant. The beginning of automated and specific client compliant time series -- time entries at Aderant, real-time fraud detection at DAT, post-production content creation automation at Foundry, automated construction takeoff at ConstructConnect, insurance forms automation at Vertafore and many more exciting GenAI technology deployments throughout 2025. The future is exciting in this regard, for sure. Now, please turn to Page 14 and let's review our tech segment's full-year results. Revenues here grew 9% on a total and organic basis and EBITDA margins came in at 35.2%, just great results here. We'll start with Verathon, which was simply awesome in '24. Verathon's strength is driven by the team's exceptional level of discipline, discernment, and tenacity. Throughout 2024, Verathon just won in the marketplace, becoming the market share leader in the US for single-use bronchoscopes and extending their global market share lead in video laryngoscopy. Obviously, we continue to be bullish about Verathon and their future. For the full year, Neptune was very, very good. They continued to see strong ultrasonic static meter demand and increasing adoption of their meter data management software offerings. And from an operational and market momentum view, they're exiting the year stronger than ever. Great job by the Neptune team. NDI or Northern Digital returned to growth in Q4 following a very challenging year due to the difficult comparable that resulted from a large customer product launch in 2023. Good things in the future for NDI. Finally, CIVCO and IPA ended the year with very good, if not great, financial results. Congrats. As we look to 2025, we expect to see high single-digit revenue growth for this segment. So, with that, please turn with us to Page 16. Let's turn to our Q1 and full year 2025 guidance. Based on what we previously discussed in the segment overviews, we're initiating our 2025 financial guidance to grow total revenue north of 10%, which excludes any future capital deployment benefits. Embedded in this guide is organic revenue growth in the 6% to 7% range. Finally, we expect full-year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $19.75 and $20. Our guide continues to assume a full-year effective tax rate in the 21% to 22% area. For the first quarter, we expect adjusted DEPS to be between $4.70 and $4.74 as we absorb lower acquired margins in Application Software and a tougher comp in our Network segment. Now, please turn with us to Page 17 and then we'll open it up for your questions. We'll conclude with the same three key takeaways with which we started. First, our cash flow growth was strong, once again demonstrating our consistent and durable compounding capability. Second, we entered 2025 with improving momentum. And third, we now have over $5 billion of acquisition firepower at a time when the M&A markets are becoming increasingly more attractive. As it relates to our cash flow compounding model, we grew free cash flow 16% on the back of 14% total revenue and 6% organic revenue growth. Our M&A capability deployed $3.6 billion towards vertical market leaders, which helped drive our compounding flywheel but also improved the quality of our portfolio. Importantly, our fundamentals are strong and we exit the year with quite positive momentum. We saw a reacceleration of our fourth quarter organic revenue growth to 7%, also on a full-year basis, we grew our enterprise software bookings in the double-digit area, better in the second half, and continue to see high single-digit growth in our $4.6 billion recurring and reoccurring revenue base. Importantly, our enterprise continues to get better as we grow. In 2024, we upgraded key leadership talent, a few of which we highlighted earlier, we expanded our capital deployment capabilities and capacity, advanced our operating model and made meaningful strides developing and deploying GenAI-based solutions. Finally, we are very well positioned with more than $5 billion of available M&A firepower to deploy capital towards leading vertical market software businesses. The M&A markets are very active and appear to be accelerating pace given the increasing pressure limited partners are placing on their private equity GPs for liquidity. Our M&A team is very busy cultivating and building our robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities. As usual, we're excited to pursue these opportunities with our unbiased and disciplined approach. Now as we turn to your questions and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic compounding flywheel, we'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by executing a low-risk strategy and running our dual threat offense. First, we have a proven powerful business model that begins with operating a portfolio of market leading, application specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve their long-term and sustainable organic growth rates and underlying business quality. Second, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses in a deliberate and disciplined manner on cultivating, curating, and acquiring the next great vertical market-leading businesses to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow over the long arc of time in the mid-teens area, meaning we double our cash flow every five years or so. So, with that, we'd like to thank you for your continued interest and support and open the floor to your questions. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ken Wong of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Ken Wong: Fantastic. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about that 6% to 7% organic growth outlook. How clean is that number? Are there any notable one-off headwinds, tailwinds that we should be thinking about that's impacting that from getting to the steady state?
Jason Conley: Hey, Ken, this is Jason. Thanks for the question. No, nothing one-time in nature. We did talk about just in the first quarter in our NS segment, we talked about this last quarter, our MHA business had a one-time thing that sort of popped through. So little bit lower organic growth in the first quarter at AS and NS. But then that will start to pick up as we talked about high single-digit recurring revenue. That will be more in Q2 through Q4. So, as you think about Procare coming in organic in the second quarter and then just some of the bookings we talked about in the second half converting into revenue sort of more in the late first quarter, early second, that -- you'll start to see that inflect up. Nothing really unusual in our tech segment. We still expect strong growth across the enterprise. And I think we've said this before, this 2024 is kind of our cleanest baseline year since 2019 with just all of the COVID and supply chain noise that we experienced. So we feel good about the setup for this year.
Ken Wong: Okay, fantastic, Jason. And then just a quick follow-up. As far as unclogging the M&A logjam in '25, as you look at the pipeline of potential deals, any preference for growth bolt-ons or looking more standalone category leader types?
Neil Hunn: Yeah, Ken, it's Neil. I'll take that one. So, our team and we talked on the prepared remarks, we added a fair amount of capacity and capability in our M&A group this past year and they've done a lot of state work, building a lot of relationships with sponsors, with companies directly, both on the platform side and on the bolt-on side. Now when you got $5 billion to deploy, we'll be able to do everything that makes sense from a bolt-on point of view and then hopefully find one or two platforms. Sort of, is very situation dependent, but yeah, it will be a balance between the two.
Ken Wong: Perfect. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you so much. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano of TD Cowen. Your line is now open.
Joe Giordano: Hey guys, good morning.
Jason Conley: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Giordano: So like coincidentally, the water companies at my house literally right now putting in a new Neptune meter. So I hope that's factored into the next quarter guidance there for you guys.
Neil Hunn: Static or mechanical?
Jason Conley: That’s right.
Joe Giordano: I'll see what it looks like when she's gone. Great. So it was good to hear some of the AI tools you guys are deploying here. I was wondering if there's a way to quantify either in terms of ability to price differently and charge for new capabilities and what it's done there or what it's done internally for you guys in terms of margins and making your businesses more profitable and more efficient.
Neil Hunn: Yeah. So, I'll say in '24, it was a great year of learning, early momentum. We went through seven or eight examples of things we're in the market with from a product point of view. But the momentum is just -- is just -- is just building from here. Very encouraging breakthroughs, obviously that the world is focused on this last week, which makes the models even cheaper, more commoditized, which means you can deploy them in more specific use cases for lower costs. So it's got our teams thinking we're just on a call with several of our CTOs yesterday on what their early thoughts are there. So it's super encouraging about the future. I will tell you in terms of the specific mathematical, can we point to it in '24, it's very hard to point to. We got this many millions of revenue or we saved that many millions of costs, but there is definitively a halo effect where we've seen bookings increase, for instance, at Amazon, that's funny, at Aderant and because they're the leader on this, we've seen bookings pick up at Deltek because of the Dela assistant that they have. And on the productivity side, real breakthrough gains on customer support, starting to see gains on the R&D side, but we're not looking at it initially from a -- how do we take cost out of the enterprise, we look at it about how can we serve our customers more efficiently and how can we chew up more of a roadmap, right? How can we have -- take the productivity to be offensive is how we're thinking about it.
Joe Giordano: Yeah, that all makes sense. And then follow-up, the one business that I guess people are a little concerned there might be some sort of headwinds just from a US policy standpoint could be like the GovCon piece of Deltek. Just curious what you've seen there and if that's a valid concern or if it is like how does that play out?
Neil Hunn: Yeah. So, Deltek and their customers, which are federal government contractors, US contractors and DOGE and all the policy, it's super early to know really how it's going to shake out. And I'll tell you, the guiding principles of DOGE, a couple that are important is the accountability for contractors are going to increase. Pricing models may change to be more performance based, they may have to modernize their systems. All that plays into the strengths of Deltek because with more accountability, it's going to be more audits compliance. We just acquired a wonderful company called ProPricer, which is about how do you manage more performance-based pricing. So that feels pretty good. But it's very early to know at the end of the day how this will flow. Importantly, bookings and government contracting in Q3 and Q4 and activity through the first part of Q1, at Deltek, [government] (ph) contracting have been quite robust. So the customers speaking with their wallets at least through this have seemed relatively bullish about the opportunity.
Joe Giordano: Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the color.
Jason Conley: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you so much. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird. Your line is now open.
Joe Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Neil, just following up on your AI comments, so we've heard recently from some of the large enterprise vendors, horizontal vendors that this ends up being quite positive thinking about what we've seen from small language models, you commoditize the model, you're able to differentiate at the business process later. I would say in Roper's case, you're typically dealing with, I would say, more unique and regulatory burdensome business processes. Does AI make it easier for others to come in and tackle those or do you think because you're the incumbent, you have the starting product focus, you have the distribution that you would expect you end up deepening your moats because of the progress that's happening in the model space?
Neil Hunn: So, we're super paranoid on this question and engaged with our companies all through '24, through the AOP process, through the strategy process precisely on this question. Where we land on it is that we're in a very good position to be the winner. And it's really -- I tried to comment it in the prepared remarks for a couple of reasons. One is, we are really intimate with our customers. I mean, this is not, for instance, I'll use the Aderant example. We're not about how do you create a project-based professional services bill. We're about how does a specific law firm create a specific bill for a specific client that's compliant to that client's billing requirements. It's a very nuanced, specific thing. And as we talk about intimacy, that's what we talk about. So at the intersection of the intimacy, the intersection of the data we have and now with the new enabling tools, we believe that we're uniquely advantaged to be able to solve problems that here before haven't been able to solve -- be solvable with the technologies available at the time. The other thing that's important to note, at least in our verticals we participate, we are in every one of our companies, we are the market share leader. We have relevant market share advantage of, in some cases 1.2, in other cases, we're twice or 2.5 times the size of next largest competitor. So we have scale advantage in these small niches to be able to make these investments. And so we like the course of travel, but we're going to remain vigilant and paranoid and encourage and press our companies to make the investments at the -- at a pace that makes sense to be able to compete and win.
Joe Vruwink: Okay. That's great color. On the outlook for next year, I would imagine you are run rating high-teens bookings going forward, but the last few quarters now have been pretty impressive. I think if you just run rate double-digits, it probably gets to something better than a mid-single-digit outcome for AS organic. I guess, are you starting the year baking in any sort of hedge? I know you just addressed Deltek, but maybe any risk points that are a consideration and if the risks aren't borne out, you maybe get raises later on.
Jason Conley: Yeah, Joe, it's Jason. I think we finished 2024 at 5.6% to be exact on AS. And I think we had strong gross revenue retention in the year, we had good bookings in the second half of the year. So that's all part of the growth equation. So, we think we're going to be better than that. And I think it's just we're going to want to see how the first half plays out. I mean, obviously, I think if you think about the year, again, Procare is going to roll organic in the second quarter, so that will help the growth rate. But yeah, I think if we continue to see the momentum we saw in the second half, there could be some chance for upside. But how that converts to revenue is a little slower than just immediate impact unless it's perpetual. The one upside I would say in the year is if GovCon Enterprise remains strong and there's a bias to perpetual, which candidly, we hope there isn't just over a long term. But if there is, then we could have some upside there for the year.
Joe Vruwink: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much. Our next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman of Truist Securities. Your line is now open.
Terry Tillman: Yeah. Hey, Neil, Jason and Zack, it's good to see this dual threat offense in action. I guess, maybe my first question and it's -- I appreciate the call out on the enterprise software bookings strength. But what I'm curious is, could you stack rank a little bit from -- as you talk to the leaders of the businesses, what's kind of -- is there any macro that's actually starting to help green shoots on that front or just some execution? Because sometimes you do change out some of the leaderships, enhance go-to-market optimization, and then thirdly, like conversion to SaaS. Could you maybe kind of double click into what you think are some of the most poignant drivers of this enterprise software bookings strength? And I had a follow-up.
Neil Hunn: Okay. So, Terry, we'll do our -- I'll do my best to hit all the points you just raised there. So, first, I would say from a macro point of view, compared to where we were this time last year versus now, we certainly feel it's a more stable outlook for the macro, which is positive for sure. Jason mentioned -- I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we think -- we attribute a lot of the success we're having to having better leaders with more precise choice-based, right-to-win-based strategies and an execution model to be able to deliver. And so where we've been able to mature this and have these methods and means be in place the longest, we are seeing the benefits. And it's clear and obvious. It's a great part of Roper. It takes a little bit of time for all this to work because there's no fast way to build enduring sustainable improved organic growth rate, but it happens methodically over time and we continue to turn that crank. The examples in that would be certainly what we're seeing at Deltek, Aderant, PowerPlan, DAT, ConstructConnect, to name a few. I mean, there's other -- Verathon for sure, NDI, there's -- I mean, you can go through the list and every company is getting better, but those are some of the highlights in terms of where the -- all this is really starting to sort of click and we're seeing over the long -- a medium arc sort of acceleration organic. And then I think there was a question -- I don't know if it's just a general question about SaaS conversions, we continue, that's a longer-term growth driver for us. There's still north of $900 million of on-premise maintenance that we're in the process of productizing and moving to the cloud at north of 2 times clip in terms of ARR. And so that's a nice tailwind. The amount of perpetual has been going down over time. So, to the extent there's a J-curve, we've sort of just -- it's embedded in our results over the last few years. And so it's a nice longer-term tailwind.
Terry Tillman: Yeah, thanks for that. And then just Jason, as it relates to DAT, I don't know if this is -- maybe this is a hard question, but pricing and packaging and value kind of monetization with some of the initiatives, when would that actually start hitting and how impactful? Thank you.
Jason Conley: Sure. Yeah. So I think in the fourth quarter, they had an action on half of the market or half of the side of the network and then there'll be another one sometime in the first half of this year probably and then a little bit more at the end of this year as well. So, and it all relates to what Neil talked about, which is just increasing the sort of the safety and the reliability of the trading partners on the network, just what we're doing from a fraud perspective and performance perspective on the load board. So just continuing to innovate. There's more innovations coming. A lot of releases they're going to have this year. So we're really excited about what's happening at DAT.
Neil Hunn: While we're just on DAT, I'll put a plug in for this small bolt-on we did in the quarter, Trucker Tools. We think this one has the potential to just be a terrific adder to the network, real-time visibility to all the network participants. We have the concept of having the customer base we have on the carrier and the broker side and then delivering more value to both sides in which of the network with Trucker Tool does and being able to monetize it from there, really exciting potential with this bolt-on.
Terry Tillman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brent Thill of Jefferies. Please ask your question.
Brent Thill: Good morning. Neil, when you think about AI, it just seems like there's a distracting light among some of the software buyers and trying to figure out what to do with that. Are you seeing any of that distraction in your engagements, and the sales engagements or is this year verticals more insulated, they're more focused on the business value, the AI piece is more back-burner. How -- what are you seeing from that -- the CIO behaviors?
Neil Hunn: Yeah, we've also been asking that question quite a bit and we've not seen a distracted, I mean, maybe in the first half of last year when this was all new and everybody was just canvassing like hold on what's going on. That was part of the first half macro that was going on as part of that interest rates, economic inflation, all that. But as of late, there's been none of that. And I would attribute the root cause of that to be, we are the system of record for the vast majority of what our customers do and they're looking to us to enable -- take the enabling technology of GenAI and then apply it to very specific settings. They don't have a competing large SAP or large whatever that we [indiscernible] next to, we are the system of record or we are the system that they need to operate the network or get their lead generation or whatever it might be.
Brent Thill: Okay. And I appreciate kind of your comments on M&A and the magnitude of things that can unlock this year. I guess that this kind of the area around focus and what you're focused on, I know you can't tell us the lanes you're going, but should we expect kind of similar lanes? Are you open to doing something different than you've done in the past? How do you think about kind of the direction given the magnitude of the M&A cleanup that seems to happen in the industry this year?
Neil Hunn: No, we're always have been and we'll continue to be like wildly focused on what it is that we do, right? So for platforms, it is small market, vertical market leaders that have enduring competitive advantage. You can understand and observe the competitive forces that is the leader that has growth that is compelling to us where we can and potentially add more capital to bolt-ons. I mean, that is what we do and we will continue to be business pickers first and foremost and not sort of be thematic vertical investors like we want to put X dollars into this theme, we're just going to always be business pickers. Now where that ultimately takes us, it's to be determined based on how the deals manifest over the course of the next year or two.
Brent Thill: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please ask your question.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Hey, Dean. Good morning.
Jason Conley: Good morning.
Deane Dray: Hey, I know it's not a big dollar amount, but you did call out that $9 million of restructuring. Could you expand on that, like how many businesses, what's the payback? And I'm really interested in the genesis of this. I'm guessing this had nothing to do with headquarters. This was all bottom-up, but just be interested in how it was initiated.
Jason Conley: Yeah, I can take that, Dean. So yeah, it was a couple of businesses. It was mostly in our AS segment and the largest was at Deltek. And I think just this coincides with Bob Hughes coming in, taking a look at where they want to make some reinvestments back in the business. So obviously, going to get some flow-through in 2025, but we'll have some reinvestment back into things like product, things like growth. And so that was just an opportunistic opportunity to do that. And then we had a couple -- I guess had a couple of smaller ones too, where it was again just having a good finish to the year and wanted to just make sure that they could take some actions rolling into '25.
Neil Hunn: I would just characterize it as good healthy belt tightening.
Deane Dray: Good to hear. And just separately, could you give us an update with any kind of specifics regarding the Transact integration with Seaboard. Just what kind of initiatives, where and how might that play out during the course of this year?
Jason Conley: Sure. So, so far, it's going really well. We've identified the $20 million of cost synergies and those will mainly start rolling through in the first quarter of this year. So that's going well. The team has been set and they've actually added some new capabilities, the executive team, they've got a new Head of Services that just joined -- that's part of the value creation plan is sort of creating a -- as they're moving a lot more customers to the cloud with their campus ID solution, having a professional services organization that can manage that in a accretive way. And then just really, I think overall, making a lot of progress on the integration, we've underwritten an ERP that's going to cut across the business and that should create efficiencies over time, not immediately, but over time. And so yeah, we're excited about. I think the feedback from the market has been really positive around whether they're going from a product roadmap perspective, showing what the cloud native solution can do from Transact. And so I think it's not only the Transact customer base that's on-prem is excited, but now you're increasingly seeing the Seaboard customers saying, hey, this is the right way to go. And so we think that's just going to create some great cross-sell tailwinds in the next couple of years here.
Deane Dray: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Your line is now open.
Scott Davis: Hey, good morning, guys.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis: Hi, the last few quarters kind of sequentially, you've gotten increasingly more positive on M&A and the outlook and such and you certainly were active over the last year as well. But would -- this is kind of a unique situation, it feels like in '25. Would you consider issuing equity, Neil, if the opportunity set were wide enough, where it would make sense?
Neil Hunn: So, obviously, the first source of capital is going to be the $5 billion in our balance sheet and our debt capacity. If the market then at that point continue to present very compelling deals to us, then certainly we would consider the use of equity, but the bar is higher, the return bar is higher, the asset quality is even higher because the cost-of-capital is higher. So that all goes into the decision-making process. But let's be clear, we will be delighted to be able to deploy the $5 billion that we have we have. That drives the compounding machine for us. I mean even in difficult years, let's just let's make this clear for the record. I mean, in the years where there wasn't a lot going on in the last couple of years, we got our work done as well. So that's where our relationship sort of always being in the market sort of benefits us maybe even the most is when the times are not as good. And so we'll just be steady deployers of capital through good times and bad.
Jason Conley: That's right. And I'd also just say that the metabolism of all these assets in private equity is not going to be immediate. It's going to take more than a year for that to happen. So, I don't think it's going to be all at once.
Neil Hunn: This will not clear in '25. It will be a '25 and '26 clearing for sure.
Scott Davis: Okay. So, there's no sense of panic on the other side. Okay. I got you. All right. And just kind of a -- you guys have been talking about talent upgrades, I don't know, for maybe more than a year or so, but when you think about talent and what do you think about kind of a ratio of internal -- when you're filling jobs, external versus internal, do you feel like you're building enough internal talent? You kind of mentioned that the winners hire winners and I certainly believe in that. But do you guys think about that, like how that fill rate should be internal versus external or if there's some optimal or mostly external just given your business mix? Just kind of curious how you think about that.
Neil Hunn: No, we're for five or six years, been really deploying aggressively what we call our talent offense that's focused on selection of talent, development talent, and the engagement of talent. And we have, as we've talked about widely and often, we have the attributes, the behavioral attributes of our field leaders that need to be competitive, curious learners that can think long-term and make that long-term actionable today and then be completely geeked up and excited to build the underlying capabilities of the business or behavioral attributes we look for. So we started this, we had to go outside, right? But then the development part of this talent offense has been -- its early signs are encouraging, right? So we have Strasa that moved to frontline. We got Brody that that's now leading ConstructConnect. By the way, Brody started in the Roper office with the CFO in Antibiotics and DAT, then ConstructConnect and now is the CEO of ConstructConnect. And so it would not surprise me if there were other leadership moves within the portfolio as the bench, if you will, gets deeper and broader and better and that's always going to be our first-call. If you think about it just from a risk management point-of-view, Scott, when we were needed to sort of replace the -- upgraded talent at Frontline, we're able to move Stras into frontline, the CFO, Brody to the CEO of ConstructConnect, the Head of FP&A to the CFO, and then we go out to the market to hire an FP&A leader versus a CEO of one of our larger businesses, right. So, risk management point of view, it works all-around.
Scott Davis: Good color. Congrats on the quarter. Good luck this year, guys. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Steve Tusa: Hey, good morning.
Neil Hunn: Hey, good morning, Steve. It's good to hear you -- hear from you.
Steve Tusa: Really strong cash in the quarter. Obviously, 32% is above 30%, but it's meaningfully above 30%. Are you at some point going to change that algorithm or is there something about the 32% that was a bit overdriven in the fourth quarter? And then how do we think about that? Should we think about that as kind of normal seasonality this year for you guys as we move into the first and the second quarter on cash?
Jason Conley: So, yeah, I mean, this was a really strong renewal season for us. If I had to call out specific companies, I mean, Deltek and Aderant just drove down record DSO and even Strata emerging from the integration with Syntellis, they sort of got everything in line by the end of this year and had just a great finish to the year. Verathon and Neptune were all so spectacular. So, just great work here, a little bit better than we thought. So it may come a little -- might come out of Q1 just a little bit. So -- but nothing super unusual. I'd just say on the non-operating front, we did issue a couple of billion of new bonds and our first coupon payment will be due in like, I think, February and April of this year. So that's more of a '25 versus '24 item. But I mean, overall, it's just a really strong year.
Steve Tusa: Yeah. And then just one last one for you, Neil. You guys are clearly making some progress on integrating AI. Are there any businesses where I'm sure you're -- in your reviews, you've asked a lot to these questions. But is there any businesses where you see perhaps threats where at the margin, you guys are obviously on the watch for any incremental competition coming from this and disruption? And any signs of that whatsoever and obviously, you guys are reacting by investing. But what are you seeing from that perspective for businesses that have always been very strong and had relatively high market shares?
Neil Hunn: Yeah. So I would say, we spent a lot of time at the portfolio level worrying if there is an existential threat at the portfolio level. And last year, there was one company that we had on the watch list, did the work and they moved them off the watch list from a threats point of view. Actually think it's medium to long-term a tailwind now that we understand the landscape and the IP ownership landscape better than a year ago in that end market. And then I would say, hey, in certain of our verticals, are there teeny-tiny start-ups that are doing very bespoke small AI things, yes. But all the customers are actually want to consolidate vendors, not proliferate vendors. And so it just gives us an opportunity to sort of be the benefactor of the winner because of that trend.
Steve Tusa: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. All right. Thanks for the answer. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just wanted to start with any color on the EBITDA margin outlook. There's been a lot of revenue related questions, but in 2024, I think the core margin firmwide was flat, headline including acquisition down a touch. So as we're thinking about 2025, should we think about sort of core margins maybe up slightly and then the headline margin flat and that sort of back-half loaded with first half margin down year-on-year and then up in the back half. Is that the way to kind of think out EBITDA margins?
Jason Conley: Yeah, I think you summarized it well. Core margins will be up a little bit. I talked, especially at the segment level, be up nicely and then acquisitions, especially like you said, especially in the first half with Transact coming. Transact's largest margin quarter is the third quarter or about 50% of their EBITDA comes in that quarter, so lower in the first, a little bit lower in the second. So yeah, I think the way you've described it is spot on.
Julian Mitchell: That's great. And then my follow-up just on the TEP segment. We haven't had many questions on that yet. So, trying to understand, as you're thinking about kind of the revenue outlook here, maybe home in a little bit what you're expecting for Neptune. I think there's some noise around various kind of meters businesses and sort of customer inventory reduction. So how are you thinking about Neptune for 2025 revenue? And also maybe any color on how did the TEP backlog perform in Q4? I think it was down about 30-ish-percent year-on-year in Q3, but off a very elevated base. So just kind of how have orders or book-to-bill moved there?
Neil Hunn: Yeah, I'll take the first part and ask Jason to take the second part regarding the backlog. So hey, the -- is there is strength in the segment and Neptune is, I think something like 40% of the segment. And so we certainly expect them to be good in the year when we're guiding to where we're guiding in the HSD area. The other thing that's just -- there was some noise in the comps in the prior year. We talked about NDI, we talked about our products, all that sort of in the rearview mirror. So we just have a clean base to grow from. And it's pretty consistent growth across the group here.
Jason Conley: Yeah. I mean, just on backlog, I think we've talked ad nauseam about the supply chain lead times and things that happened over the last few years and that's normalized out. We still have a little bit higher backlog there than, say, pre-COVID. So that's positive. And I would just say early signs in this year are that a lot of the distributors are restocking significantly and the sales kickoff that Don and his team had a few weeks ago indicates just continued strength in the market this year. So, it will kind of get us back to where we were pre-COVID, which is fine, right, which is that we work off a one to two-month backlog and just continue to see growth without working on off of a backlog.
Julian Mitchell: That's great. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you so much. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: Thank you, presenters, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending and you may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-23 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good Morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the third quarter 2024 financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Senior Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, the financial impacts associated with minority investments, and lastly, transaction and restructuring-related expenses associated with the completed acquisition of Transact Campus. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now please turn to Page 4. I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thank you, Zach, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our third quarter results with you this morning. As we turn to Page 4, you'll see the topics we'll cover today. I'll start by highlighting our third quarter financial performance. Jason will then go through our financial results in greater detail, review our balance sheet, including our M&A capacity and discuss our very strong cash-flow performance. Then, I'll walk everyone through a summary of our most recent acquisition, Transact Campus, then discuss our segment highlights and review our increased guidance for the full year. After our closing remarks, we'll open the call for your questions. So let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the four key takeaways for today's call are, first, we again delivered another solid quarter results and expect an acceleration in sequential organic revenue growth heading into Q4. Second, we completed the Transact Campus acquisition, a very attractive business at a very attractive net purchase price. Third, we're raising our full-year guidance to the high end of our range. And fourth, we continue to be very well-positioned relative to executing on our capital deployment strategy. Now digging a bit deeper into these four key takeaways. We grew total revenue by 13%, organic revenue by 4% and EBITDA by 10%. Importantly, we grew free cash flow by 15% in the quarter and by 20% on a TTM basis. Operationally in the quarter, Neptune performed slightly better than our expectations as they resolved last quarter's mechanical meter production challenges. And also importantly, we're encouraged to see strong organic enterprise software bookings momentum continue this quarter, growing in the double-digits area, up from last quarter's high single-digits bookings growth. Also in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Transact Campus. Our CBORD business is being combined with Transact and integration activities are well underway. This is yet another very compelling value-creation opportunity for our shareholders, which we'll discuss in a bit. Based on strong enterprise margin performance, we're increasing our full-year 2024 DEPS guidance to the high end of our range. In addition, we're increasing our outlook for total revenue growth to be 13% plus given the addition of our most recent acquisition, Transact Campus. Finally, we're maintaining our approximate 6% organic revenue outlook for the year. If we step back a bit, we recognize we just posted back-to-back 4% organic growth quarters, although not unexpected without question unsatisfying. That said, we do see quarterly organic growth momentum improving and expect our Q4 organic growth to sequentially improve given back-to-back quarters of strong enterprise bookings growth, stabilizing freight market conditions, albeit at the bottom, our resolved Neptune operational issue and MDI returning to growth in Q4. So with this mostly behind us, we're confident we are seeing a reacceleration of our growth. And finally, we continue to be very active on the M&A market, an environment that continues to improve and one where we have a very large pipeline of highly attractive opportunities. We continue to be quite bullish about our ability to be active on the M&A front. So with that, Jason, let me turn the call over to you, so you can walk through our quarterly and full year financial results as well as our very strong financial position. Jason?
Jason Conley: Thanks, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Let's take a look at Slide 6. Revenue was $1.76 billion and up 13% over prior year. Acquisitions contributed 9%, led by Procare and Transact Campus, and organic growth was 4%. Just unpacking organic growth a bit. In application software, revenue grew over 5% with recurring and reoccurring growth in the high single-digit area. Non-recurring revenue was down low-single digits, led by declines in new license sales. New business activity for enterprise software continues to lean towards SaaS, which ultimately creates higher customer lifetime value while yielding a slight drag on near-term non-recurring revenue. In network software, recurring revenue growth of 1% includes temporary headwinds at DAT, Link and Foundry. The balance of the segment saw growth in the mid-single-digit area. As Neil will discuss later, we see stabilization in freight markets and expect some improvement in Q4. TEP organic growth of 4% was underpinned by strength at Verathon and prior year comp challenges at NDI, Inovonics & rf IDEAS. As we discussed last quarter, NDI had a very significant customer program in 2023 that created year-to-date comparison challenges. However, we expect a return to growth in Q4. Separately and importantly, Neptune rapidly resolved its mechanical meter production challenges in the quarter. EBITDA of $717 million was 10% over prior year and EBITDA margin came in at 40.7%. On DEPS, we posted $4.62, which was above our guidance range of $4.50 to $4.54. Of note, the Transact acquisition contributed $0.03 in the stub period as the third quarter is seasonally the highest driven by fees from annual tuition payments and annual renewals of term licenses. Excluding Transact, our guidance beat came from strong core margin performance in our application software segment. Turning to free cash flow, we had our highest-ever quarter with free cash flow of $719 million, up 15% over prior year. Transact was cash accretive in the stub period of ownership and off to a fast start with Q3 being once again seasonally strong for this business. We also had a simply great execution across our software and tech product businesses. Of note, net working capital as a percent of revenue, excluding acquisitions was negative 19%, a new Q3 record. A special thanks to our world-class finance teams across the Roper family who are laser focused on cash returns and cash flow growth. Tremendous job. The bottom right chart provides a trailing 12-month view of free cash flow over a four-year period. The CAGR from the corresponding 2021 period is 12%. If we adjust for the Section 174 that went into effect in 2022, we've compounded cash flow in the mid-teens area. The strong Q3 results places our year-to-date cash flow at 31% as a percentage of revenue and with renewal season at many of our software businesses in Q4, we expect free-cash flow margin to be north of 30% for the year. Turning to Slide 7, I'll now discuss our balance sheet. So net debt of $8.1 billion on trailing EBITDA of $2.75 billion yields leverage of 3 times at the end of the quarter and a bit lower if we pro-forma for the recent acquisitions. In the quarter, we entered the bond market and issued $2 billion across five, seven and 10-year tenors for a blended rate of 4.8%. This was used to fund the Transact deal and partially pay down the revolver, which has a quarter-end balance of $925 million. As we move forward, our strong cash flow and use from investment-grade leverage provides us with $4 billion or more of capacity to deploy towards high-quality acquisitions. To that end, I'll turn it over to Neil to talk about the Transact deal and its compelling combination with our CBORD business. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Jason. Let's turn to our most recent acquisition overview. Transact Campus is another fantastic addition to the Roper portfolio. Let's start with the investment highlights. We paid $1.5 billion net of a $100 million tax benefit for the business. We expect Transact to deliver about $325 million of revenue and $105 million of EBITDA next year, which means we paid about 14 times the EBITDA we expect this business to contribute next year. Transact is adjusted DEPS breakeven this year, be accretive to our adjusted DEPS next year and is immediately cash flow accretive. And we will report Transact as combined with CBORD and our application software segment. On a standalone basis, Transact meets all our long-standing acquisition criteria, leader in the niche market, delivers mission-critical verticalized software solutions, competes based on customer intimacy, operates an asset-light business model and is led by a skilled, passionate leadership team. Let's talk about what the company does. Transact is a leading provider of mission-critical and purpose-built software and integrated payments to higher-education institutions in two focus areas, first, in campus identity management, and second, related to tuition management. The market itself is quite attractive and in the midst of the long-term secular tailwind of universities working to improve the on-campus experience required to attract and retain the next generation of students. We estimate the combined market size to be in the $1.5 billion range and growing 6% to 8% per annum. As previously mentioned, we're integrating our CBORD business with Transact. CBORD will combine its university campus ID business with that of Transact, creating a leading provider of these solution. We expect a long-term organic growth rate of the combined business to be in the high single-digits area. The go-forward leadership team has been announced, the 2025 $20 million cost synergy plan is well underway and the initial set of customer feedback has been quite positive. As you can see, Transact is a highly compelling value-creation opportunity for Roper and our shareholders. As we turn to Page 10, let's review our application software segment results. Revenue here grew by 23% in total and organic revenue grew by 5.5%. EBITDA margins were 43.6% and core margins improved 20 basis points in the quarter. Before getting into the business-specific details, I would like to share a few macro trends we're seeing across this segment. First, we continue to see improving organic enterprise bookings performance, growing in the double-digits area in the quarter following HSD growth in Q2. Importantly, the enterprise-class customer sluggishness we saw during 2023 and the first quarter of this year appears to be waning. Finally, we continue to see strong growth in recurring and reoccurring revenue in this segment, growing in the high single-digit area in the quarter. Turning to our business unit-specific commentary, we'll start with Aderant, our software business focused on the needs of large law firms. Aderant continues to perform incredibly well in the market and had another great quarter. Over the past few quarters, we have highlighted Aderant's improved product development velocity and in particular, with GenAI powered features. Now, this innovation activity is adding to their already-strong bookings momentum, including very nice new customer additions and continued progress in adding new and expanded products within their existing customer base. Deltek, our software business serving government contracting, architecture, engineering and construction markets was strong in the quarter as well. In particular, Deltek's enterprise-class government contracting customer activity improved in the quarter, which is encouraging to see. Also, and as a reminder, Deltek continued their ongoing cloud-based software momentum and expanded their GenAI embedded functionality. PowerPlan, our financial planning and tax software business serving heavy fixed assets industries continues to impress with their operating and financial results. PowerPlan has done a tremendous job over the last three or four years on improving the customer experience, accelerating their software innovation velocity and improving upsell, cross-sell activity. Great job by Joe and his team in Atlanta. Frontline continues to perform nicely and had strong renewal activity and delivered excellent seasonally high cash flow. Of note, we're excited to announce Matt Strazza as Frontline's new CEO. As some of you may recall, Matt joined Roper as Deltek's go-to-market leader, then was promoted to be the CEO of ConstructConnect. Matt did a wonderful job at ConstructConnect and we're excited about having this growth-oriented leader at the helm at Frontline. Also of note, we promoted Buck Brody, ConstructConnect's CFO to assume the CEO role. Buck has been in the Roper ecosystem mostly as the CFO over the past 13 years. This is one of the first, though certainly not the last time, we'll promote leaders across and within Roper. We continue to remain quite bullish about the future for Frontline. Our Healthcare IT businesses led by Strata and Data Innovations were also strong in the quarter and delivered excellent growth. Finally, Procare continues to execute well. Importantly, as part of our evolving governance processes tied to faster growth or maturing leader nature of our portfolio, Roper is working to improve its go-to-market capabilities from lead-generation to deal execution as well as go-to-market leadership. We really like what we're seeing here, although it's early days. As it relates to the guidance for the final quarter of the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. Please turn with us to page 11. Organic revenue at our network software segment grew 1% in the quarter and was impacted by the fact we continued to experience pressure with our freight matching businesses and work through the impact on Foundry from the recent actors and writers strikes. Excluding our freight matching businesses and Foundry, this segment grew in the mid-singles area, which demonstrates the underlying quality of this group of businesses. EBITDA margins continue to be strong at 56.2%. Let's dig into the details and start with our freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink, which declined slightly as expected due to the continuing challenging freight market conditions that adversely impact both businesses. That said, we continue to see further signs of market stabilization for both carriers and brokers. During this softer period, DAT continues to invest to accelerate new product development philosophies. Now, let's turn to Foundry, our post-production media and entertainment software business. Foundry continued to roll out innovative product updates and ML-powered functionality this quarter, meaningfully enhancing the creative process for high-quality, post-production visual effects. Given the continued impacts related to the recent industry strikes, Foundry declined in the quarter as expected. We now expect the hangover from the strikes to carry into next year as Foundry's customers continue to navigate through tight economic conditions until the creative pipelines matriculate to the post-production phase, which we expect to be sometime during 2025. As mentioned, the balance of this segment grew mid-singles organically in the quarter with solid execution across this portfolio. In particular, ConstructConnect continued its solid march of improved financial results and bookings momentum. In addition, ConstructConnect continues to lead the market with our GenAI-powered takeoff and estimating solutions. Finally, our alternate site healthcare businesses performed well, led by our software solutions at MHA, SoftWriters and SHP and further benefited from improved senior care occupancy. Turning to the final quarter of the year, we expect organic revenue to improve a bit but remain in the low single-digits area as we continue to experience stable but muted freight market conditions. Now, please turn to Page 12 and let's review our TEP segment's results. Revenue here grew 4% in total and on organic basis and EBITDA margins came in at 35.4%. We'll start with Neptune. Neptune rapidly resolved our mechanical meter production issue within the quarter, performing slightly better than we anticipated. Importantly, during the short-term bespoke manufacturing challenge, Neptune was able to deliver on all their customer commitments. In addition, Neptune continues to see solid demand for both mechanical and static meters, positioning Neptune very well for the foreseeable future. Next, we'll turn to Verathon. Verathon continues to perform exceptionally well with solid growth across our GlideScope and BFlex product offerings. Of particular note, we're pleased to report that Verathon is the market-share leader in the US for single-use bronchoscopes. Five years ago, we entered this market with a strong belief that we had a higher right to win given our incumbent GlideScope position and now we have claimed the market-share leadership position and Verathon is not done. Great job by team Verathon. Northern Digital or NDI declined as we expected in the quarter based on customer program timing that led to a very difficult comp. That said, OEM order activity remained strong in the quarter. Finally, Inovonics and rf IDEAS each declined against difficult prior year comps. As a reminder, these businesses started recovering from supply chain challenges last year. For the fourth quarter, we expect to improve to high single-digit growth given Neptune is back on track operationally and NDI's customer program timing begins to normalize. With that, please turn with us to Page 14. Now let's review our full-year 2024 guidance and discuss our fourth quarter outlook. Based on strong application segment margin performance and the addition of Transact Campus, we're increasing our total year growth outlook to be north of 13% and we expect full-year organic growth to remain consistent in the 6% area. In addition, we're raising our full-year guidance to be in the range of $18.21 and $18.25, the high-end of our previous range and an increase of $0.06 at the midpoint. Please note, we expect Transact to be DEPS-neutral for the full year. Our guidance continues to assume a full-year effective tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted DEPS to be between $4.70 and $4.74. Please note, our newest acquisition Transact will be about $0.03 dilutive in the quarter. Also, as a reminder, the impact of our $20 million synergy plan meaningfully skews to 2025. Now, please turn with us to Page 15 and then we'll open it up for your questions. We'll conclude with the same key takeaways with which we started. First, we delivered a solid quarter of financial results and expect an acceleration in sequential organic revenue growth heading into Q4. Second, we completed the acquisition of Transact Campus and commenced the integration with CBORD. Third, we're increasing our outlook for the full year. And finally, we are very well-positioned relative to our capital deployment strategy. For the quarter, we delivered 13% total revenue and 4% organic revenue growth, while increasing our EBITDA 10%. Of note, we grew our enterprise software bookings in a double-digit area and continued to see high single-digit ARR growth. Importantly, free-cash flow was impressive, growing 15% in the quarter and 20% on a TTM basis. Next, we completed the compelling acquisition of Transact Campus. The combination with CBORD creates a leading software and integrated payments business that helps universities solve the pressing issue of making the student campus experience more compelling. The cost synergy execution risk here is quite low, most of which has already been actioned, leading to a very attractive shareholder return. Next, we're increasing our full-year outlook for total revenue to be north of 13% and maintaining our approximate 6% organic revenue growth outlook. In addition, we're increasing our full-year DEPS outlook to the high end of our prior guidance. Finally, we continue to maintain a strong financial position with over $4 billion of capacity for capital deployment. The M&A markets continue to be very active. We have a robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities that we're excited to pursue with our unbiased and disciplined approach. We remain quite bullish about our ability to execute this part of our strategy. Now, as we turn to your questions and if you can flip to the final slide, our strategic compounding flywheel, we'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple, we compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading, application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate in decentralized environment so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve their long term and sustained organic growth rates and underlying business quality. Finally, we run a centralized, process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses in a deliberate and disciplined manner on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow over a long arc of time in the mid-teens area. With that, we'd like to thank you for your continued interest and support and open the floor for your questions. Please go ahead, operator.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Your line is now open.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Hey, maybe we can start with the strategy around Transact Campus and I note that CBORD is being combined with the business right away. And historically, Roper really never clustered the application software businesses preferring more standalone siloed businesses. You never talked about scale. I don't think, I've seen a cost synergy estimate coming out of a transaction in a long time. Does this -- is this more of an opportunistic acquisition? You've done it before, you've combined medical purchasing, you've done some insurance business, back-office clustering. So we've seen this before, but this is right-off the -- out of the blocks, it's being combined and the synergies look obvious, but just maybe is there a subtle difference here, more willingness to look at these attractive growth areas? Maybe start there. Thanks.
Neil Hunn: Yeah, appreciate the opportunity to talk about that, Deane. The short answer is yes. So even going back to our Investor Day 18 months or so ago, we outlined, I think, there a modest evolution of our capital deployment strategy to focus on a bit more of what we call bolt-on activity and then also the kind of businesses that are a bit faster-growing, call it, mature leaders. And so since then, if you look at our acquisition we've done since then, we've done Strata, Syntellis. So Syntellis, and combine it with Strata. That was the -- archetype is very similar to Transact. We bought Procare, which was our first maturing leader, slightly faster growing business and then Transact. If you go back to 2019, I think we've done 26-ish acquisitions and there'd be a handful of platforms out of that. So we have leaned into a fair number of bolt-ons. I would say on the bolt-ons, the driving -- the principal driving reason for that is to buy businesses where we have a high right to win, and adjacencies that are close to ours that we think increase the likelihood for accelerated organic growth once the bolt-ton turns organic. So yeah, it's very much part of our strategy. And we've tooled up the capital deployment team that Shannon has. We've got folks that are focused on partnering with our businesses, doing a lot of the development work in the marketplace. So yes, it's a strategic intent and we've started the execution pathway.
Deane Dray: That's great to hear. And maybe for Jason, and I appreciate you guys putting the spotlight on the free cash flow compounding flywheel because it seems like that's what you got this quarter with free cash flow up 15% and DEPS up 7%. So just talk about that spread and was there any sort of seasonal contribution to free cash flow in this quarter? Frontline typically has that's a higher contribution in the third quarter. Just any dynamics there? Thanks.
Jason Conley: Yeah. So I mean, Q3 is now our strongest cash flow quarter. I mean, since we acquired Frontline a couple of years ago and now with the addition of Transact, it's definitely our strongest quarter. Transact has helped a little bit, maybe a couple of points of growth in the quarter. It's our, as I mentioned, seasonally strong for them. But aside from that, we just had tremendous execution through the renewal seasons, which is Q3 and Q4 for us. So Q4 is expected to be strong as well. And I would just say DSO improved almost across the board for a number of our businesses. And so just good old-fashioned execution, I think, is what drove that -- that drove that outsized growth relative to DEPS.
Deane Dray: Great to hear. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Brent Thill: Thanks, good morning. Neil, you mentioned some of these macro headwinds. It seems like they're turning a bit. I'm curious if you can just dig into what you're seeing in some of the tone in some of the buyers. And then just maybe for Jason, just if you can just speak to Neptune and how confident that you think we're through some of the challenges that we saw? And what are the reasons why you're confident in that recovery?
Neil Hunn: Sure. So I'll just -- I'll take the first one, Jason will certainly take the second one. So first, I’d -- just to remind everybody, we've worked hard over the last handful of years to really beat a lot of the cyclicality and macro out of what we, if you think about end markets we serve, there's education, there's legal, government contracting, there's healthcare, insurance and what we sell and what we deliver is mission-critical software. So we're generally not turned on and off based on the macro. And then most of our pricing is subscription-oriented versus transactional. So there's sort of three levels of muting in that regard. But still, we're not immune to the macro, but we muted it. I would highlight a couple that we've been talking about really since the beginning of last year first. We're talking, this time we're even -- call it six or six quarters ago, it was about interest rates and an economic slowdown. It was, I think, the most anticipated economic slowdown in modern history and that psychology of that just slowed down to some extent the enterprise class buying activity across software. We're cautiously optimistic based on the last couple of quarters of enterprise software bookings activity last quarter in the high single-digit area growth, this quarter in the double-digit area growth. Pipelines look very robust heading into the end of the year. So we need to execute that on our pipe -- those pipeline. So we're encouraged by that. The second macro factor certainly that takes the headline for us is the transportation macro with our DAT and Loadlink businesses. They're subscription oriented on both sides of the network, both the carrier and the broker. But the number of carriers in the market loosely follows the amount of tonnage that flows over the roads. And so as the tonnage has come down, so is the number of carriers that are participants in the network, which could put pressure on that. We've just seen there's probably been 20 weeks to 25 weeks of negative brokered loads compared to prior year that actually in the last handful of weeks is more normalized to last year. So we very much are seeing a stabilizing in the freight market. So those would be the macros that have impacted our business. Jason?
Jason Conley: Yeah. And just add to talk about Neptune a little bit. So if you recall, we stood up the ultrasonic or static line last quarter, the second-line. And so we had some constraints in our mechanical meter production. And so, happy to report the root causes were identified, corrective actions implemented. We had some yield issues on plastic molding that got printed. Some of the machines were creating some constraints as well. That's been remedied. Really like the trends we saw through September and those trends pretty much inform the production output for the fourth quarter and beyond. So we feel good about demand is really strong there. So it's really just getting through this mechanical meter production issue and we feel good based on what we saw in Q3 and the confidence the teams have in Q4.
Neil Hunn: The only thing I'd add to Jason on Neptune, as I said in the prepared remarks, Neptune was able to deliver 100% on the customer commitment. So this was -- there's no issue there. Kaizen continue to improve and get even further improvements and Don and the team did a great job just going to gemba on the shop floor and getting to root cause.
Brent Thill: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Julian.
Julian Mitchell: Maybe I just wanted to follow up on the sort of the macro context as it pertains to network software specifically. As we're thinking out sort of beyond this quarter trying to gauge how you're thinking about the recovery slope at network software, you cautioned that Foundry in aggregate next year may not see much growth because of the ongoing sort of strikes hangover. I just wondered on sort of DAT and Loadlink that portion what the expectation is? Do you think it's plausible, we could just keep moving sideways sort of sequentially for some time? And maybe just frame as you see it now, how much are Foundry and the freight match businesses down in 2024?
Neil Hunn: So I'll take the first part. So, on DAT and Loadlink, it was intentional that we changed our word choice this call to be stabilizing. So it is very much a stabilized market. We anticipate for until we see anything other than stabilized, that we're going to be in this position from just a tonnage or load volumes that are going over the roads and into the network. That said, DAT does have a pathway and a plan, a high confidence plan to return to some modest levels of growth next year with no assumed improvement in carrier network participation through packaging price. And so we'll have, like I said, some modest growth at DAT next year that we have a pretty high degree of confidence heading into our AOP sessions that comes that will occur next month. And then on Foundry, it's just the -- waiting for the post-production employment to return to its historical levels. I think we're about 15% below pre-pandemic or pre-strike, I should say, employment levels and post-production and we just need -- the content is being produced, it's just got to matriculate through the pipelines and that will be sometime in 2025. So it's definitely taken a few quarters longer than we anticipated earlier in the year. Jason?
Jason Conley: Yeah. Sorry, freight match is down sort of low singles for this year. I think we definitely think for NS in general that the Q3 is the low point for us. And then that will start to trend up as Neil said through the fourth quarter and then into next year and the pacing is just dependent on sort of the market momentum there. On Foundry, it's been down double-digits this year and that's been pretty consistent throughout the year. So we expected a little bit more of a recovery in the second half of this year. But as Neil said, it's taken a little bit longer. So yeah, as we think about the trends for next year, I think, the first quarter, just to remind you, we had -- we called out an MHA sort of sort of one-time item this year. So beyond that though, we expect steady growth into next year for the segment.
Julian Mitchell: Thanks very much. And then just my follow-up, switching back maybe to the EBITDA margins at TEP. So those have been sort of down year-on-year for a few quarters. You've mentioned the production issues, there were clearly supply-chain efficiencies sort of moving around. As we look-ahead at TEP, kind of what's the confidence maybe that margins can return to year-on-year expansion in the coming quarters.
Jason Conley: Yeah. No, you're right. I mean, the second and third quarter we had -- if you recall last year, we had some big supply-chain liberation for our med product businesses and our product businesses. This year we're down a little bit. NDI is down, had a little bit of negative mix and we're obviously investing for growth there just because it's always been a consistent double-digit grower for us. So we're continuing to invest in NDI. But I think for the year, just thinking broadly, we're going to be flat EBITDA margin. And so it should inflect back up in the fourth quarter.
Julian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.
Terry Tillman: Yeah, thanks. Hi, Neil, Jason and Zack. And my primary question is actually on the enterprise software bookings. I think you said double-digits, up from high single-digits. I don't know what you could share in terms of what kind of budget flush you're looking for 4Q. I assume there is some of that. So if you could make either a comment on that or just more importantly, if the bookings are picking up, do you think there's potentially an inflection in the first half next year or second half just depending on how some of that activates to revenue? And then I had a follow-up.
Neil Hunn: Yeah, I'll provide some color there, Terry. I mean, I think you're right. The fourth quarter for us is not necessarily a budget flush, it's probably just more customer behavior. It's typically our biggest quarter. So we're obviously keen to see how that plays out. You're right, the last couple of quarters have been strong. I think just a little bit of color. Neil mentioned that Deltek, GovCon Enterprise got a little bit better. So if you think about what happened from Q2 to Q3, that was a little bit of the delta. Also, Verathon was really strong, specifically in the carrier space. Also had good broker expansions, but carriers has been an area that has been a focus for them. So good to see some new logo wins there. And then Aderant has been really strong as we've mentioned, but it's really good to see the balance of both expansion of existing customers and then some new logo wins with their Sierra Cloud products. So it's good to see that they're continuing to win in the market with new logos. And then when we think about the -- the fourth-quarter is going to be important, like, as I mentioned in terms of how that plays into next year and sort of how that will matriculate into revenue. But we're encouraged what we saw the last couple of quarters.
Jason Conley: Yeah, we are -- obviously, we continue to have enterprise bookings momentum that will matriculate into revenue. And next year, the timing of which depends on implementation timeframes and customer go-lives. But yeah, I mean, it's definitely a trend that we're watching carefully.
Terry Tillman: That's good to hear. And just my secondary question. Neil, you commented earlier when you get into kind of business level commentary and kind of talent management moves you make. I think you talked about Procare and Frontline. I guess kind of -- what drove kind of some changes there? And I think you said go-to-market is the idea that, hey, they're doing well, but they could be doing even better or just maybe you could double-click a little bit into Procare and Frontline and what to expect with some of those leadership changes? Thank you.
Neil Hunn: Sure. So they're are two different things. I'll start with Procare. So, Procare, we identified in our diligence process that there is an opportunity to improve, modernize whatever word choice you want to pick, the go-to-market functions. And so within a couple of months of ownership, by the way, we shared those diligence finding and value-creation lever with the leadership team of Procare, they agreed with that. We made a leadership change. I like what's happening there, obviously the leadership change in go-to-market for Procare which by the way is an internal promote, it was somebody from within the company. And then, you can start attacking the underlying opportunities, which was there's a lead-generation opportunity. There's a way they actually staff the calls between inbound, outbound, between business development and closures. There's a compensation angle, there's call scripts around attach rates and upselling. So all that is happening and we're -- it's very early days, but starting to gain some encouragement, so that's starting to yield some fruit. So it was again a diligence finding where we thought there was a value creation lever attached to it and the team sort of attacked it pretty quickly. It's simply different. So our existing leader retired or indicated he wanted to retire. So we had an opportunity with Matt Strazza that we have a long history with. As I mentioned, hired, and came into the organization as the go to market leader at Deltek. Did a wonderful job there. Then his first CEO opportunity was the ConstructConnect. Just did a terrific job in terms of the way the business is run. It's very much run in a Roper style and he's a very growth-oriented leader. And so given that Frontline is one of our more attractive growth assets, we wanted a growth leader there. And it’s very early days. I mean, he's two months into the job or something like that at Frontline. And then [indiscernible] effect of that is the CFO at ConstructConnect, Buck Brody became the CEO of ConstructConnect and then the Head of FP&A became the CFO at ConstructConnect. So from an enterprise risk perspective, we're able to sort of promote and rotate leaders inside Roper. And essentially the outside hire is an FP&A leader at a business versus the CEO of one of our larger businesses. So it's a win-win for the organization and individuals.
Terry Tillman: That's great. That's very helpful. Thanks.
Neil Hunn: My pleasure.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is now open.
Scott Davis: Hey, good morning, guys.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis: I wanted -- just a little bit of a high-level question, but there was a lot of price in the last couple of years, not just you guys, pretty much everybody out there. But have you found any harder to get price incrementally? Are we back to kind of more normal? When we walk into 2025, for example, we would be back to kind of the more normal price increased cadence, particularly in software, obviously. But just a high-level picture, what do you see there?
Neil Hunn: I would say just, I would -- I seem to recall you asking a price question a few years ago as well. So for us on software, we've always had a pricing mechanism in the ARR snowball. Right. As a general matter, we trip -- we have 95-or-so-percent gross retention. So we're going to trip 5-or-so-percent. We're going to offset the vast majority of that at each business unit level with price. It's just in the algorithm, it's in the price expectation with the customers, it’s in what we do from a new product feature point of view with the R&D and efforts we support that obviously [cross-sell itself] (ph) from there to get you net retention in the 105-ish range across the blended enterprise. And we have net new on top of that. That I would say is a muscle that is very well understood and built. We can obviously get better. An example, we've gotten better with that over the last few years with PowerPlan, they didn't have that muscle built. Now it is built. But I would say we didn't get outsized pricing in software and so in the past and so it's just reverting to normal. On the tech businesses, I would say that's a little different. Most of the businesses would take price when they launch a new product. Now there's just a more normalized inflationary every year for 18 months or so opportunity to pass the regular wave of inflation across.
Jason Conley: Yeah, typically medical product, too, it's all about new products versus price just because you're sort of bound by some of the customer contracts with hospitals and the like. But yeah, I think Neil's point on software is it's been part of the rhythm for a long time. A lot of what we've done in strategic plan reviews is understand key purchasing criteria and really unpacking that at a more detailed level for each of our businesses and that's helped them. It's provided some confidence or just some insight into what the customer thinks about the value proposition and that's been helpful as well.
Scott Davis: Okay, yeah, that makes a lot of sense and it's consistent with what you said a couple of years ago. But hey guys, there's just a lot of debate as it relates to software around AI, Generative AI. But, I just wonder kind of your view now that you've had a chance to dig more into this and spend more time on it. It's certainly in your slide decks and you're launching products. But does the Generative AI essentially raise the barrier to entry because you have the relationship with the customer already and you can shorten your time to market on product innovation or is it the opposite, and people can come in with a lower priced product easier because just the development cycles are somewhat shorter? How do you guys think about that?
Neil Hunn: I think it's very much the former, the first. I mean it is -- if you think about what we're doing, first of all, it's the highest level. I mean it's a real thing. We're definitely, I think the whole market is in sort of the trough of disillusionment if you will. I mean the hype is -- the reality is starting to catch up with the hype. I would say the number of new use cases that are being created, I think just not only for Roper, but what we read externally is slowing but we're very much advancing the existing use cases whether it's internal productivity or customer-facing product stuff. I would remind you and everybody that from why we think this is an accelerator and sort of raises the barrier to entry is, to do Generative AI, I think you have to have two things. Well, right. And [Technical Difficulty] software businesses are naturally positioned better than others in regards to these two questions. The first is you need to have [elements I should say those] (ph) questions. You need to have the data that is very, very specific to what the question is you're answering. But then you also need to know what question to ask. And again the more nuanced the question, the better the generative tools are. And I'll give you a very simple example. We have a legal assortment of business that is the ERP backbone for large law firms, right? It's professional services project-based billing. The question is not how do you create a professional-based bill, it's how do you create a -- how does law firm A create a compliant bill for Roper Technologies? Right. And so the very specific bespoke questions, the nuanced questions is where the general tools really, really shine. So unless you, the incumbency really matters in that regard. So it's not about the -- we can develop software as faster, faster than any startup can build software from a generative point of view, but we have the incumbency and the data. I'll probably say verticalized software businesses generally and the incumbency in the data and the specific questions of which to sort of ask if you will.
Scott Davis: That's good color and context. Thanks. Good luck, guys. Appreciate it.
Neil Hunn: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Steve Tusa: Hi, good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Steve Tusa: Just on the -- following up on Julian's question, on the NSS business for next year. So, which businesses are accelerating and how much of a headwind is that MHA benefit in the first quarter? And then will you be able to kind of get into that mid-single-digit range for that business next year?
Neil Hunn: So, I think, Steve, I think we want to stop short of even implying any guidance in the next year. What I would say just broadly across the enterprise is we like the momentum we're seeing in enterprise software bookings and the fact that it is normalized, a pretty normalized 2024 year from which to grow. You see the reacceleration heading into Q4. We expect those Q4 trends to carry into '25, but I think we want to just sort of stop there short of issuing guidance next quarter.
Jason Conley: That's right. I think on MHA, we can call that as a couple -- MHA in Q1 is a couple of points of drag in Q1.
Steve Tusa: Got it. Okay. And then just lastly on cash. Obviously, a really strong result here. Seasonally, it steps up. How does it now behave seasonally in Q4? Last year, you were down, but not by much like basically kind of flat-to-down. Is that kind of the new seasonality? Or was there something unusual in Q4? Maybe just help us with this seasonality because it's definitely different than it's been in the past given the Frontline.
Jason Conley: Yeah. Q4 used to be our strongest and now like I said, Q3 is our strongest. I think it will be -- we won't see quite the same increase in the fourth quarter as we did the third. Obviously, we got -- Transact came in. So that was helpful, but that's obviously, the strongest collections quarter as well. So that will -- it will be up, but not as much as Q3 in the fourth quarter.
Steve Tusa: Got it. Sorry, one more. Just on Vertafore, I didn't see it in the slides, any updates there?
Neil Hunn: Yeah, Vertafore had -- I think Jason mentioned in his prepared remarks, they had a couple of very, very nice wins in the quarter. You can't really talk about them quite yet. But we will be able to -- also they've had a very impactful product release and they have a product called BenefitPoint, which is the leading product for sort of managing the medical health insurance book. And the -- they have an automation feature that saves like 45 minutes per customer per -- per benefit plan. So this is tens of thousands of hours of productivity that were sort of given to our customers. It's a huge release. They worked on this for quite a bit. So, like what's happening with new product development point of view, couple of nice exciting wins and steady-as-she-goes.
Steve Tusa: Got it. Congrats on the cash. Thanks.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.
Joe Giordano: Hey guys, good morning.
Neil Hunn: Hey, Joe.
Joe Giordano: Hey, so on Neptune, it's good to hear the production issues have been fixed. Just curious, like we've been hearing some, like kind of mixed, I guess, about order patterns in that business. Like, I know almost everyone in that sector had like huge orders for a multi-year period and backlogs are really high. Are you getting any sense of like change in like the incoming flow from like a new bookings standpoint for Neptune?
Neil Hunn: I would say, it's very much what we expect and what you just described. So during the pandemic, I mean pre-pandemic, this was a four to eight-week lead time business, very much a book-and-ship type business. During COVID, we got -- our lead times gapped out to maybe 12 or 14 weeks, but we had 12 to 18 months of backlog ordered -- the order activity and now the order duration is compressing, but the number, the order volume, if you will, the repeat orders are not. So we're not -- it's just a -- instead of booking a year out, they're booking whatever six -- the customer booking six or nine months out. So that order of duration is coming in as expected. But nothing again for repetitive purposes, nothing from a number of meters that are being shipped to an account-by-account basis, that is all healthy.
Joe Giordano: Yeah, that makes sense. Just curious if any of your businesses, like, if you -- when you talk to the leaders, are any of them like super-excited or super nervous one way or another about the election outcome? Like, I know, I'm thinking maybe is Deltek get excited about a potential, like, an inflationary kind of spending spree from the government like this and I guess across the portfolio, is anything that you call out one way or the other?
Neil Hunn: As a general matter, I'd say we're apolitical and no. I mean we're not really impacted positive and negative by either the administration. Relative to Deltek, want to remind you and others is that the government always spends. The administration determines the nature of the spend. So if you go way back, in the Bush era it was defense and Obama was education and healthcare. And so the spend flow changes but the government contractors just position their capabilities where the flow of the federal spending is going. And so that's relatively -- it's just what their business is. I would say for '25, the '25 appropriations are actually pretty well understood at this stage and aren't going to change based on the election. That's why I think we're starting to see some of the enterprise government contracting activities starting to thaw a little bit, at least for the one year target, if you will, is relatively well understood.
Joe Giordano: Great. Thanks guys.
Neil Hunn: Yeah, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Joe Ritchie: Hey, good morning, guys. So my first question just a little bit longer-term. Neil, as you have these ambitions to grow the portfolio at a faster clip over the longer-term period, like, do you think you have the right portfolio in place or is there maybe some addition by subtraction to help you kind of achieve the ambitions of maybe more of like a high single-digit type organic growth number going forward?
Neil Hunn: I think we -- the portfolio we like, we think that there is, we have high confidence there's opportunity for every business inside of Roper to do better. No company has reached its full potential relative to its organic growth. What we like about our approach to improve organic growth is it tends to be quite sticky and sustainable. The downside is it takes time, right? There's no -- it doesn't happen in a year and we cited it at our Investor Day and I'll cite it here again. I mean a great example for us in TEP is our Verathon business. Eight or nine years ago, it was a low single-digit growth business. Now it's a low teens, maybe higher growth business, we think sustainably for quite some time and it takes, just, unfortunately, it takes time to get the strategy right to enable the strategy to build the talent offense to seed in deeply a culture of continuous improvement. We're four or five years in across the portfolio for that and so we're definitely gaining some traction but we like our odds in terms of being able to improve the organic growth. Then in addition, as I mentioned, I think one of the -- definitely one of the -- the first question today is as we deploy our capital, we're definitely tilting towards slightly higher growth businesses like the Transact combined with CBORD high singles, Procare mid-teens. So there's going to be a little bit of mix-up over time in terms of the portfolio mix.
Joe Ritchie: Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And maybe just following up on that last point, with your leverage now around 3 times net leverage, and I recognize that the pipeline is still strong, do you expect to see any pause in M&A activity as you de-lever and then start to get a little bit more opportunistic or could you see yourself doing transactions in the next -- in the near-term, call it, the next three to six months?
Neil Hunn: Yeah. I mean the -- as Jason alluded, we've got $4 billion plus of M&A capacity as we sit today. Over the course of the next 12 months or so, we're very active in the M&A markets. It's a very attractive market. There's lots of sellers, one of the largest sponsors in the world, European sponsors on CNBC earlier this week and asked about what's the mantra, it's sell, sell, sell. So there's a lot of LP pressure, DPI matters a lot. And so there's essentially three or four years’ worth of deals that are compressing here in the next year or two. And so it's a very attractive market. We plan to be active in that.
Joe Ritchie: Great to hear. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: Your last question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Christopher Glynn: Yeah, thanks. Was going to ask also about the deal dynamics out there. You answered the supply side. On the demand side, is that still very favorable to where you're seeing diluted buyer activity per deal?
Neil Hunn: In terms of the competitive intensity on a per deal basis, if that's the question, it's hard to ultimately know. I mean, I would call out that we did the Transact deal on a proprietary basis. I would say that our M&A teams are engaged in -- engaging in more proprietary or quasi-proprietary opportunities and I can recall quite some time. And -- but -- and I think it's -- so we know those are facts. I think where I would speculate a little bit with so many opportunities that are going to be coming out of the pipeline, I think all buyers are going to be a little more discerning early in processes, which might lead to a little bit lower competitive intensity, but hard to know that to be an absolute case.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And then in terms of Deltek and the general GovCon exposure, a lot of the stimulus in mega projects, a lot of compliance hurdles are gating that process. Are you seeing any increased letting or momentum in that? And what's the implication for those platforms in '25?
Neil Hunn: I would say the -- I would just refer back to what we were talking about before with GovCon. It has been for six quarters slowish based on the uncertainty. About four to six quarters slow based on the uncertainty of the government spending, the operation of the government. We saw some green shoots here in the last quarter or two relative, especially in the enterprise class. Some of the larger customers are starting to be acquisitive again of Deltek. The exact underpinnings of the drivers, some of that might be infrastructure, but some of it might be other things. That's not in our specific purview.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: Yeah, Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zach Moxcey for any closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: This concludes -- the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-24 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. All participants will be in the listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. We discussed the second quarter 2024 financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon Callahan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and financial impacts associated with minority investments. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our second quarter results with you this morning. As we turn to Page 4, you can see the topics we'll cover today. I'll start by highlighting our second quarter performance, Jason will then go through our financial results in greater detail, review our balance sheet, including our M&A capacity and discuss our strong cash flow performance. Then I'll walk through our segment highlights and discuss our guidance for the full year. After our closing remarks, we'll open up the call for your questions. So, let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, three key takeaways for today's call are: first, we delivered another solid quarter results; second, we're increasing the bottom end of our full year outlook; and third, we continue to be very well positioned relative to executing on our capital deployment strategy. To double-click a bit. We grew total revenue by 12%, organic revenue by 4% and EBITDA by 13% with EBITDA margins expanding by 20 basis points to 40.5%. Importantly, we saw good bookings momentum with organic enterprise software bookings increasing in the high single digits area during the quarter. Finally, we grew free cash flow of 24% in the quarter and 35% on a TTM basis. Also, TTM free cash flow margins came in at 32%. We are also increasing our full year 2024 guidance on the low end and maintaining our outlook for total revenue and organic revenue reflecting our continued confidence in our outlook, notwithstanding some production efficiency challenges at Neptune, which we'll discuss in a bit. And we continue to be very active in the M&A market, an environment that continues to improve and one where we have a large pipeline of highly attractive opportunities. Net-net, we continue to be quite bullish about our ability to be active on the M&A front this year. So, with that, let me turn the call over to Jason to walk through our P&L and key balance sheet metrics. Jason?
Jason Conley: Thanks, Neil, and good morning to those joining the call. As always, thank you for your interest in Roper. If we look at Slide 6, I will provide an update on Q2, both against prior year and against a longer historical time frame. Revenue was $1.72 billion, which is 12% higher than prior year. Underpinning this was organic growth of 4% and an acquisition contribution of 8%, driven mostly by Procare and Syntellis. Organic recurring software revenue grew 6% and as we cycle through the tougher comps at freight match and foundry, which we've outlined in prior calls. We see signs of stabilization in both the freight and media and entertainment markets, which Neil will discuss further. Given our leadership positions and continued innovation investments at DAT, Loadlink and Foundry, we are confident that these businesses will capture growth upon market recovery. Also of note, organic growth in our tech segment was 5% with some production delays at Neptune. EBITDA was $695 million, which is 13% over prior year and yielded EBITDA margin of 40.5%, representing 20 basis points of expansion. Debt of $4.48 was above our guidance range of $4.42 to $4.46. Free cash flow was quite good at $367 million, up 24% over prior year and bringing year-to-date growth to 19%. Broadly over three years, our Q2 revenue has compounded 13% through a combination of organic growth and our consistent repeatable and disciplined M&A process. Q2 EBITDA CAGR over the same period has outpaced revenue at 14%. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow compounded at 10%. Adjusting for cash tax payments related to Section 174, which went into effect in 2022, the normalized CAGR is 12% over this three-year period. Just looking at our current trailing 12-month performance against the prior TTM period, free cash flow of $2.1 billion grew 35% with free cash flow margins of 32%. We expect this to normalize in the second half and for 2024, we continue to expect free cash flow margins of 30% or more. With that, we can turn to Slide 7 to go through our financial position. With our strong Q2 cash flow, we paid down the revolver by $300 million, which brings our drawn balance down to $1.45 billion on a $3.5 billion capacity facility. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio now sits at 2.7x, which when coupled with future cash generation provides us with capacity to deploy $4 billion or more towards market-leading BMS businesses. On the capital deployment front, we have been quite busy over the second quarter and expect that to continue into the second half. Now, I'll turn it back over to Neil to talk through our segment detail and updated guidance.
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Jason. As we turn to Page 9, let's review our Application Software segment results. Revenue here grew by 21% in total and organic revenue grew by 5%. EBITDA margins were 43.6%. We experienced strong performance across this portfolio of businesses with organic recurring and reoccurring revenue growing in the high single-digit area. So, let's start with Deltek. Our software business serving the government contracting, architecture, engineering and construction contractor markets. Deltek was solid in the quarter. We saw continued momentum across our private sector solutions and improved bookings activity and revenue within their GovCon business. Importantly, and as we started to highlight last quarter, Deltek's new GenAI-powered digital assistant Dela is in the process of integrated across Deltek's core suite of software applications. We're keen to see the customer workflow efficiency benefits take route as Dela is deployed throughout the Deltek tech stack, exciting for sure. Turning to Aderant. Our software business focused on the needs of large law firms continues to perform incredibly well in the market and had another great quarter with continued SaaS momentum and GenAI-focused innovation. The Aderant team is consistently delivering new GenAI-powered capabilities across our platform, enabling meaningful efficiencies in creating significant value for their customers in areas like billing, receivables management and time entry. Also, Vertafore & Frontline performed well in the quarter with strong net dollar retention and bookings growth. Also during the quarter, we completed our periodic strategic reviews with each of these businesses and left the reviews encouraged by the long-term opportunities in front of each. PowerPlan, our financial planning and tax software business serving heavy fixed industries was impressive yet again in the quarter and grew its ARR with strong net dollar retention and adoption of its new SaaS solution. Excited to see the progress the PowerPlan team is making. Our health care IT businesses led by Strata and data innovations were also strong in the quarter. As it relates to Strata, the combination with Syntellis continues to go very well with the vast majority of the cost synergies now in the rearview mirror. Great job by the team implementing this portion of the value creation plan. Since the completion of the transaction with Syntellis, the sales pipeline has continued to fill with substantial growth opportunities with several of these opportunities converting to bookings during the quarter. Further to this end, with the cost synergy faced behind the team, their full attention is now focused on long-term growth-related initiatives about which we are quite bullish and look forward to discussing in the quarters to come. As for data innovations, we saw accelerated growth in the quarter with customer decision-making returning to normal, encouraging for sure. Finally, Procare, the most recent addition to the Roper family companies is off to a strong start. For the second half of the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth trending to the upper end of this range for this segment. Please turn is to Page 10. Organic revenue in our Network Software segment grew 2% in the quarter and was impacted by the fact we continue to experience pressure with our freight matching businesses and work through the impact on Foundry in the recent actors and rider strikes. Excluding our freight matching businesses and Foundry, the segment grew in the mid-singles area, which demonstrates the underlying quality of this group of market-leading businesses. EBITDA margins continue to be strong at 54.8%. Let's dig into the details and start with our freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink, which declined slightly as expected due to the continuing challenging freight market conditions that adversely impact both businesses. That said, the market appears stable, both on the carrier and broker side, bouncing along the bottom, if you will. Notwithstanding this and is typical for Roper, we invest for long-term sustainable and improving levels of organic growth. In DAT's case, we're absolutely doing this, leading the industry with GenAI-enabled fraud detection and prevention tools. Also, and importantly, in the quarter, we welcomed a new DAT CEO to the team, Jeff Clementz. Jeff has a long and successful career in network and software businesses, and we look forward to working with him to deliver the next chapter of DAT's growth. Now let's turn to Foundry, our postproduction media and entertainment software business. Foundry continued to roll out innovative product updates and ML-powered functionality this quarter, enhancing the creative process for high-quality visual effects. Given the continued impact related to the recent industry strikes Foundry declined in the quarter as expected. That said, the current content production pipeline is filling and Foundry's customers are beginning to reramp their capacity, which gives us confidence Foundry return to more normalized growth next year. As mentioned, the balance of this segment grew mid-singles organically in the quarter with solid execution across this portfolio of businesses. By pipeline, our life insurance and annuities network software business, has strong renewals, customer expansions and market activity, especially in the annuities market. ConstructConnect continued its solid march of improved financial results and bookings momentum. In addition, ConstructConnect continues to lead the market with their GenAI power and take off and estimating solutions. Great job by Matt, Buck and the entire ConstructConnect team. Finally, our alternate site health care businesses performed well with MHA benefiting from increased operational focus and rigor and improvement in senior care occupancy rates. SoftWriters, our LTC pharmacy software business continued their cadence of solid execution, well done. For the second half of the year, we expect the difficult freight market conditions to persist which resulted in our continued low single-digit organic revenue growth outlook for this segment. Now please turn to Page 11, and let's review our TEP segment's results. Revenue here grew 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins remain strong at 36.2%. We'll start with Verathon. Verathon had very strong growth across all through its product families and once again executed at an exceptional level in the quarter. The long-term success of Verathon is directly attributable to its leadership team building the business and all the underlying processes to enable sustainable long-term and improved organic growth. This long-term disciplined focus is truly a competitive advantage for Verathon. Neptune continues to be solid and delivered another record quarter financial results. Demand remains strong and consistent with our expectations. Also, the Neptune team did a great job commissioning substantial ultrasonic meter capacity during the first half of this year, both of which are great relative to Neptune's long-term success. However, Neptune struggled in the quarter to achieve the manufacturing efficiency needed to deliver on the mechanical meter demand. We anticipate this to progressively be resolved through the balance of this year. Northern Digital, or NDI, declined as expected in the quarter. As a reminder, NDI is our market-leading precision measurement business. NDI partners with the world's leading medical device manufacturers to deliver innovative health care applications that require super precise navigation such as robotic surgery and cardiac procedures to name a couple. Their long-term historical growth rate has been in the double-digit area. However, NDI is declining this quarter and this year based on customer program timing. Notwithstanding the first half performance, NDI continues to see strong OEM order activity, and we fully expect NDI to return to their normalized organic growth rate next year. Finally, IPA Inovonics & rf IDEAS declined against a difficult prior year comp. As a reminder, these businesses started recovering from supply chain challenges this quarter a year ago. For the balance of the year, we expect the TEP segment to grow in the mid-single to high singles range, which is slightly below our prior expectation of high singles growth due to the mechanical meter production efficiency timing at Neptune. We do expect to return to high singles growth in the fourth quarter as Neptune's efficiency improvements take hold. Please turn with us to Page 13. Now let's review our full year 2024 guidance and discuss the third quarter outlook. Based on our first half performance, enterprise momentum and our confidence in our outlook, we're maintaining our 12% total revenue growth and 6% organic revenue growth outlook for the full year. In addition, we're raising at the bottom end of our full year guidance of touch to be in the range of $18.10 and $18.25. Our guidance continues to assumes full year effective tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted debt to be between $4.50 and $4.54. Now please turn us to Page 14, and then we'll open it up for your questions. We'll conclude with the same key takeaways with which we started. First, we delivered a solid quarter of financial results, Second, we're increasing the low end of our outlook for the full year. And third, we are very well positioned relative to our capital deployment strategy. For the quarter, we delivered 12% total revenue and 4% organic revenue growth while increasing our EBITDA 13%. Importantly, free cash flow was strong, growing 24% in the quarter and 35% on a trailing 12-month basis. Free cash flow margins were 32% on a TTM basis as well. Next, we're maintaining our full year outlook for 12% total revenue and 6% organic revenue growth and increasing the bottom end of our full year guidance. We're confident in our outlook given the mission criticality of our solutions, the ongoing expansion of our recurring revenue base and seeing HSD growth in our enterprise software bookings. Finally, we continue to maintain a strong financial position with over $4 billion capacity for capital deployment. The M&A markets are very active. We have a robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities that we're excited to pursue with our unbiased and disciplined approach. We remain quite bullish about our ability to execute this partner strategy over the balance of this year and into the future. Now as we turn to your questions and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel, we'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once a company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment, so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve their long-term and sustained organic growth rates and underlying business quality. Finally, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses in a deliberate and disciplined manner on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow over a long arc of time in the mid-teens area. So, with that, we'd like to thank you for your continued interest and support and open the floor for your questions. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: Thank you. We will now go to our Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]. And we will now take the first question, and this comes from the line of the Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Maybe we can start with the production efficiency issues at Neptune. And if I understand this correctly, so mechanical meters, it's an established platform. So, I would not expect it to be like a start-up issue on this, but maybe just share with us what the problem is, what the remedy is and so forth?
Neil Hunn: Sure, delighted to do that. I appreciate the question. So just to highlight what we talked about on the call. So first, the demand at Neptune is consistent with our expectations. So, there's no demand issue here on either the static or the mechanical side. Second, the team did just a remarkable job, standing out of the static ultrasonic capacity in the first half. That business is growing north of 20% a quarter year-on-year. So, there's capacity had to happen there. And we get to the mechanical, and I think the root cause here is just a simple, the fact that the team's attention was standing up the static and the ultrasound capacity, and we lost a little bit of production efficiency on the mechanical side. The countermeasures are in place. We just have to get back to prior levels of efficiency. We don't have to have a breakthrough level of efficiency here. And so, like I said, the countermeasures are in process. it's got the full attention of the team, and this should be resolved this year.
Deane Dray: All right. That's good to hear. And then a second question, how about any issues with the CrowdStrike fiasco earlier this week? Any impact, any new vulnerabilities across your businesses? And anything you could share there would be helpful.
Neil Hunn: Yes. Generally, a non-event for us. And based on the information we have at this stage, at this time, we don't anticipate the event will have any general impact on us.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink. Your line is now open.
Joe Vruwink: Great. There was a fair amount of discussion over the past quarter from others in enterprise software, just around maybe deal delays customers contemplate AI and investments related to it certainly doesn't seem like that's happening at broker application software. So, I was hoping you could comment just on what the portfolio companies at Roper are hearing from customers on AI and are there either postponements or I might ask inversely, is Roper actually being brought in new ways by customers to assist with their AI strategies?
Neil Hunn: Yes. I'll take a first pass of this and then Jason has anything to add. So first, it's been this -- certainly, we're aware of the situation from the other companies. And so, we're listening intently for this when we do our call downs of their businesses. And not once in any of our call downs or none of the first quarter, second quarter written summaries of business unit performance is this then the other as an issue in terms of our customers' IT spending diverting away from what we did is the first point. We've started to think about why that is. I think part of the reason is we're a teeny tied portion of the IT spend of our customers, and we're mission critical in what we do. So, I think it's a combination of the two. And our customers are very much looking to us to GenAI enable our product offerings. And we're very much doing that. We've talked about it in the prepared remarks for the last several quarters. I think there's three or four references in it in today's call. And so, we're super bullish about the opportunity. We noted enterprise software bookings up high single digits in the quarter, so some momentum there.
Jason Conley: Yes, that's right. Joe, we talked about this a month or two ago. It's pretty consistent there. And I think, like Neil said, our enterprise bookings were strong across a number of businesses. Even Deltek was still down a little bit, so it was pretty widespread. So, no. Like Neil said nothing on our calls indicated that this is an issue whatsoever, at least at this point.
Joe Vruwink: Okay. That's great to hear. Yes. And I wanted to follow up on the high single-digit growth in enterprise bookings because that does seem like a positive change in trend. So Deltek contributed, it sounds like any other big needle movers to call out just in terms of the bookings developments?
Jason Conley: And actually, Joe, Deltek was still down a little bit. So that's what Deltek. But Neil highlighted some strength at Strata. So, we saw, like I said, pipeline has been building and saw some good bookings at the latter part of Q2. Aderant has continued to be strong. Vertafore, Frontline, also really good quarters as well.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Julian Mitchell: Yes. I just wondered if you could give us some color around the Q3 EPS guide. Normally, you have a stronger sequential uplift maybe 27 plus in the last couple of years -- into the $0.10 or $0.15 into the third quarter. Is there much sort of happening there this year that's kind of weighing on that? Any kind of one-timers maybe on that point on Neptune that's weighing on the sequential growth?
Jason Conley: Yes. Thanks, Julian. I think a little bit is Neptune. So just getting that -- those operational efficiencies will push some of that revenue that we normally have in the third quarter into the fourth. And then if you just look prior year, I think we think AS margins are going to be down year-over-year in Q3. If you recall last year, it was kind of the high watermark, Q3 was, of 2023. So, we actually expect it to be stronger AS margins in Q4. So, we'll have a strong Q4 there. So, it's just a little bit of a shift on margin, I think in the AS segment, which is obviously more than half of our revenue.
Julian Mitchell: That's helpful. And then just my follow-up question would really be around the network software piece and going back to the freight market. It sounds like it's trending kind of as you thought. Maybe update us where we sit in terms of the timing of that cycle trough and what sort of slope of recovery you think we should expect there in the next kind of 12, 18 months, please?
Neil Hunn: I'll give you our best crack at what's going on there. So, as we all know, in recent past periods, DAT just really experienced abnormal growth that was consistent with the freight cycle. And then -- and then -- and sort of the freight recession is what's been impacting the business over the last several quarters. This quarter was flattish in terms of the volumes that we're seeing. And then maybe there's a little bit of green shoots happening. The spot market volumes are stable to slightly improving. Carrier attrition and the network has slowed a little bit more than originally expected or anticipated. And finally, maybe most importantly, freight rejection rates in the market are improving. And so, we're sort of balancing, as I mentioned, we're bouncing along the bottom. That's our call for the balance of the year, and we're not going to bake in an improvement in our outlook until we actually see it, but maybe there's some green shoots happening here.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman from True Securities. Please go ahead.
Terry Tillman: The first question, it's kind of a multiparter. It's related to the Deltek business. And then I did have a follow-up. It's going to be on Aderant. But in terms of Deltek on that large GovCon side, I assume that's for some of that volatility and some of the bookings weakness is still going on. Is there some seasonality dynamics and just kind of strengthening of the pipeline and visibility into the second half where you think that can turn positive in terms of bookings? And the second part of this first question is on FedRAMP. If I wasn't mistaken, FedRAMP could potentially unlock some large deals? And then I had a follow-up.
Neil Hunn: Yes. So, we'll try to take both of those. So Deltek is not really a seasonal business. Just so we're clear. Deltek got two parts of the business, about 60% GovCon, about 40% is the professional services end markets, architects, engineers, construction contractors. The professional services side, it's been solid, robust, consistent. The slowness has been on the GovCon side, particularly the enterprise, the very largest customers as just the last 12 months or maybe a little bit longer, if government spending uncertainty is what's driven sort of the slowdown or sluggishness in the market. In the second quarter, Deltek on the GovCon side, there was a little bit of enterprise activity, bookings activity, which was super encouraging to see it's been two quarters since we've seen that. And so -- and there also isn't really an election impact that's tied to this part of the business. At least historically, there's not been. So, it's just having some stability in the government spending outlook. It also doesn't really matter what the government spending is on. It just is the government operation of spending has been uncertain. I mean you're right on FedRAMP, the Company is, I think, FedRAMP have moderate complied today, and it's a definitive unlock for the SaaS migration on the GovCon side of the business, which is just in the very, very beginning, like the bottom of the first inning.
Terry Tillman: And I guess just a follow-up question. I've been struck by just from our own primary research, just the Aderant customer base and optimism about moving to cloud. Where are we in that upgrade cycle and moving to cloud. And is it unlocking kind of expansion sales opportunities?
Neil Hunn: Yes. Aderant, it's just so good at the moment for multiple factors, the one you list around the SaaS migration is just one. I mean the Company has just done a -- we got a lot of market momentum. They're leading the market on the use of generative AI tools and software applications. Their net market share winners that continue to gain net market share and just to give everybody listening context, the last five to seven years has been a market share gain, right? So, we've gone from to north of 50% market share over that period of time for large law firms, and most of that share gain was on-premise. And with the advent of COVID, the large law firms decided they wanted to start the migration to the cloud. So, we've got a multiyear journey of the lift and shift from our on-premise customers to the cloud. The product is enabled and we're just beginning that migration now. Maybe this is in the second or third inning and barrier.
Jason Conley: There's a few dozen conversions that's happened over the last three or four years. So, we're still really early. It's obviously picked up in the last, call it, six quarters. But yes, still plenty of running there.
Operator: And the next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Davis: Is it fair to say, it's getting a little harder to get price year-over-year? I'm kind of thinking specifically network software, but I guess, application software as well. But I know you had some pretty big price increases the last couple of years. Has it gotten a little harder to get price in those markets?
Neil Hunn: Scott, we would actually say we've not gotten outsized price in our software businesses over the last couple of years. Price is part of the growth algorithm that we talked about. As a general matter, right, is going to offset the attrit on the ARR base, and then we're going to cross-sell and upsell and add new to sort of get to the total growth of the business. There's been just maybe a little bit look a teeny tiny amount of price that's above normal on both the network and application software side. So, it wasn't a big benefit historically. We don't have to lap that going forward to the extent pricing were to normalize because in our case, we've been normal through the period.
Scott Davis: Okay. All right. That's good color. And then last quarter, my takeaway was your enthusiasm on kind of M&A markets unlocking was pretty high. Is that -- is it fair to say you're still in the same level of enthusiasm about being able to get high-quality deals done this year?
Neil Hunn: Very much so. The market is -- the commentary we talked about a quarter ago was the exact same commentary today. There's just an amazing amount of pent-up demand for opportunities. I think I said last time, it's going to be 3 to 3.5 years deals compressed in a couple of years. We still believe that's the case. Interesting thing happened in the first half is that the first half deals in the market were super binary based on asset quality. A plus assets traded anything in the PP or below did not which is leading sponsors to really face the reality about value and valuations. And so, the combination of that, the pent-up demand, interest rates being higher should yield more reasonable valuations. We'll see, but we're super encouraged by both that dynamic around valuation and then just the volume of opportunities that we see. Final thing I'd say is that Janet and her team are much more proactive and proprietary in our pursuits, and that's being well received by the sponsors we're engaging with.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Giordano -- I mean Joe Giordano from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Can you remind me of at Neptune, the mix between ultrasonic and mechanical? And like where that is today, where you see that going? And like is there any material margin difference between the two products today.
Neil Hunn: Yes. So, on the mix, we've been advised by Neptune for competitive reasons to sort of stay away from the specifics of the mix. Today, the market is declaratively going to static. There's a lot of benefit to static, and we believe we have a most product advantage with our static meter around being able to be accurately both high and low flow rates. Relative to the margin profile today, they're similar-ish in terms of margin profile.
Joe Giordano: Okay. And then -- if I just think about maybe more ConstructConnect, but maybe a little bit on Deltek too, but it seems like construction starts and like activity is still at a good level, but like the starts are getting worse and like we're kind of -- it seems like even on the institutional side, things getting a little bit weaker, but from good levels. Like what are the implications there? And are you seeing any of that of those businesses?
Neil Hunn: Yes. So, on the Deltek side, the construction vertical, Deltek remains strong. The pipeline activity is strong. Their bookings activity is strong. Now mind you, our customer base is very much on the S&M side. They're not the enterprise. They're not the largest customers, the Deltek services. So maybe -- I mean there's a gigantic un-bended market. So even in the headwinds of maybe a little bit of slowdown when these smaller contracts are looking for efficiency, they would look to using our software to do that, which might help with some of the pressure. At ConstructConnect, this business has just been -- it's just good old-fashioned execution that has led to better outcomes there. They're going to really get choice on their strategy and making choices to focus on the trade contractors and building product manufacturers. They've done a great job enabling that strategy around the product and R&D and go-to-market sort of changes, the lead generation changes, the way they hear their demos I think we've been four quarters of double-digit bookings at ConstructConnect. And so, it's just been good old-fashioned execution there that's led to quite improved outcome here.
Operator: And the next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Steve Tusa: On the Neptune side, what's the kind of backlog status there? And what's your book-to-bill on that front? Just some color on the orders because accelerating into 4Q when your growth was 15% seems to imply quite a catch-up even beyond maybe just fulfilling some of these other orders? And then secondarily, you mentioned high single-digit growth in software, I believe it was bookings. Is that organic or reported? And if that's total software, shouldn't that translate to revenues more near term in the second half. It doesn't look like you're accelerating there in the second half.
Jason Conley: So, on Neptune bookings, I mean we talked about the backlog coming into the year was still extremely strong, right? And so, we had three or four quarters, almost four quarters of backlog going into the year. And so, that's what we've been working through this year. And then orders have been -- continue to be strong, continue to be enough to -- I guess, to answer your question around the fourth quarter for sure in our guide and then setting up for next year. And then on enterprise bookings, the way we define that is it's all of the software business outside of DAT, Loadlink and ConstructConnect because those are more SMB-type businesses and those are annual contract value revenue. So, it's the time of booking and then you've got a -- depending on the Company, the delay between when the booking happens and when it converts to revenue, that can vary, depending on the nature of the award. And so, it doesn't always translate into revenue in the current year, but it certainly does help support where we think AS is going to be in the second half and then into '25.
Neil Hunn: That's right. And just the only thing I'd add to Jason’s thought, on the software bookings is the majority, if not the vast majority of bookings are subscription or SaaS related. So, you've got the number of months left in the year, it's just hard to impact bookings in the second half or even second quarter six months left to go. So, it really is about the launch of point in AR for '25.
Jason Conley: And yes, just to clarify, it is organic.
Neil Hunn: That's right.
Operator: And the next question comes from Alexander Blanton, Individual Investor. Please go ahead.
Alexander Blanton: It's really Clear Harbor Asset Management, not an individual investor. I want to go back to the Neptune production issue. I really wasn't clear on the answer that you gave before. So perhaps you can make some clarifying comments. What's the nature of the production holdup or problem? And I think you said that you expected it to be resolved by the end of the third quarter so that you would do some catch-up in the fourth quarter. Could you elaborate on that?
Neil Hunn: I'll do my best. So, as you know, Neptune makes the sense that the highest level makes two forms of meters, a static meter and mechanical meter. The static meter, we've had to add production capacity, which was successfully commissioned in the first half. So that's great news to the existing factory that we have in Alabama. The mechanical meter side, we have the capacity that's needed, but there was essentially a daily efficiency production rate that was below where it needed to be to meet the demand and deliver on the customer commitments. That's what's in the process of being countermeasure. Again, I mentioned before, this is just returning to levels of previous efficiency, not a breakthrough level of efficiency that would not get ever achieved. And so, the teams are fully contrasting this at the moment, and we expect it's beginning to resolve itself in the third quarter, and we hope and expect to resolve itself for the balance of the year.
Alexander Blanton: My question really was what caused it to deviate from prior levels?
Neil Hunn: We think it's -- we think the root cause of that is you've got a factory management team that was super focused on adding the static capacity in the first half and just got distracted or lost focus on the daily efficiency or production efficiency on the mechanical side.
Alexander Blanton: Well, right. But what is the nature of the production efficiency problem. That's what I'm getting at.
Neil Hunn: Alex. We're delighted to take this off-line if you want to talk about more detail.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the call over back to Zack Moxcey. Please go ahead, sir.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our conference call for today. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-26 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] 
 I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Zack Moxcey: Good morning, and thank you all for joining as we discuss the first quarter 2024 financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.  
 Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.
 Now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. 
 And now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; financial impacts associated with minority investments; and lastly, transaction-related expenses associated with the completed acquisitions. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. 
 And now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil? 
Neil Hunn: Thank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our first quarter results and our increased outlook for the year.
 As we turn to Page 4, you can see the topics we'll cover today. I'll start by highlighting our strong performance in Q1. Jason will then go through our financial results in more detail, review our balance sheet, including our M&A capacity; and finally, our notable cash flow performance. Then I'll walk through our segment highlights and discuss our increased guidance for the full year and initiate our Q2 guidance. After our closing remarks, we'll open the floor for your questions. 
 So let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, 3 key takeaways for today's call. First, we delivered another strong quarter results. Second, we're increasing our full year outlook. And third, we continue to be very well positioned relative to capital deployment. We double-click a bit. We grew total revenue by 14%, organic revenue by 8% and EBITDA by 16%, with EBITDA margin expanding by 60 basis points to 40.2%. 
 We grew DEPS by 13% to $4.41 beating our guidance range. We grew free cash flow 15% year-over-year with free cash flow margins of 31%. We also completed the acquisition of Procare Solutions, a leading provider of software and integrated payments for the early childhood education market for $1.75 billion. Procare is a great addition to Roper. We remain very excited about the business and are especially pleased with the initial results and progress we've made during the onboarding process. 
 We're also increasing our full year 2024 guidance for total revenue, organic revenue and DEPS reflecting our strong momentum and continued confidence in our outlook. And we continue to be very active in the M&A market, an environment that continues to improve and one where we have a very large pipeline of high-quality and attractive opportunities.
 Net-net, we're quite bullish about our ability to be active on the M&A front this year. As you can see, we had a great start to 2024, and we're well positioned to deliver yet another strong year of performance and growth. Now let me turn the call over to Jason. Jason? 
Jason Conley: Thanks, Neil. Let's dive right in on Slide 6. Q1 was an excellent first installment to 2024. Revenue was 14% over prior year to $1.68 billion. Organic growth of 8% was led by double-digit growth at our TEP segment and solid mid-single-digit growth across our application software and network software segments.  
 Of note, organic recurring revenue grew 7% and despite known headwinds at our Freight Match and Foundry businesses. Acquisitions contributed 6 points of growth led by Syntellis, which is a large bolt-on for our Strata platform that closed in Q3 of last year, and Procare, which closed at the end of February.  
 Regarding Procare, integration is going really well, and we're excited to work with [ Joe and Kinzel ] and her team to drive continued growth and innovation in the attractive early childhood education market. EBITDA was $676 million, which was 16% over prior year. EBITDA incremental margin of 44% translated into EBITDA margin of 40.2% and represented 60 basis points of expansion. This was fueled by gross margin expansion of 100 basis points to 70.3%.
 Our market-leading businesses compete on customer intimacy and deliver demonstrable value to their customers which we consistently realize in our high gross margin profile. Debt of $4.41 was above our guidance of $4.30 to $4.34. Importantly, free cash flow was strong at $513 million, up 15% over prior year and our trailing 12-month free cash flow surpassed $2 billion for the first time in Roper's history.  
 Looking over a 4-year horizon, revenue and EBITDA CAGRs are 13% on a quarterly basis. For free cash flow, we take a broader lens and a review on a trailing 12-month basis, which generated an 11% CAGR over this period. Adjusting for cash tax payments related to Section 174 which went into effect and impacted the period -- the current period's free cash flow by $80 million.  
 The normalized CAGR is 13% over this period. For 2024, we still expect free cash flow margins of 30% or more. With that, we can turn to Slide 7 to talk about our balance sheet. Following our Procare acquisition, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio came in at 2.9x at quarter end. Our revolver, which provides us with $3.5 billion of immediate liquidity was utilized to fund the Procare acquisition, bringing the drawn balance to $1.75 billion.  
 With strong, consistent cash generation and a well-positioned balance sheet, we have the capacity to deploy $4 billion or more towards high-quality acquisitions. And I'll reiterate our commitment to remain a solid investment-grade issuer as access to investment-grade capital markets is fundamental to Roper's strategy. In terms of what we're seeing in deal markets, our pipeline of acquisition opportunities is growing and quite attractive. As always, we will remain patient and disciplined in allocating capital to opportunities with highest risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.
 With that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to talk through our segment detail and updated guidance. 
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Jason. As we turn to Page 9, let's review our Application Software segment results. Revenues here grew by 18% in total and organic revenue grew by 6%. EBITDA margins were 43.3%. We experienced strong performance across this portfolio of businesses.
 We'll start with Deltek. Our enterprise software business survey the government contracting, architecture, engineering and construction contractor markets. Deltek continued to grow at SaaS solutions, especially within their private sector markets. Importantly, in the quarter, Deltek launched a new GenAI-powered digital assistant Dela which will be integrated across Deltek's core software applications. We also welcome Bob Hughes as the new CEO of Deltek. Bob brings a wealth of software and leadership experience to the role having most recently served as the Chief Customer and Strategy Officer at UKG. Bob, we're thrilled to be working with you.  
 We also welcome Mike Corkery into his new role as a full-time group executive within Roper. For those who do not know, Mike was Deltek's CEO for nearly 12 years, more than standing our entire ownership period. Mike, thank you for building a tremendous market-leading company. Not only is Deltek grown multifold during their leadership tenure, the underlying quality has massively improved and the culture has never been better. Thank you for everything you've accomplished and we're very much looking forward to working with you in your new leadership capacity at Roper. 
 Aderant continues to perform incredibly well in the market and had another great quarter with continued SaaS momentum and GenAI-focused innovation. Vertafore also performed well with solid growth in their ARR base.  
 Turning to PowerPlan. Our financial planning and tax software business serving the heavy fixed asset industries, PowerPlan was impressive in the quarter and grew its ARR with strong customer retention and adoption of its new SaaS solution. Great job here. Our healthcare IT businesses led by Strata and Data Innovations were also strong in the quarter. We're especially pleased to see the solid go-to-market execution at both businesses.
 Finally, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we completed the acquisition of Procare Solutions, which is off to a good start and complements this segment with a higher organic growth profile. For the remaining 3 quarters of the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for this segment.  
 Please turn with us to Page 10. Revenues in our Network Software segment grew 5% in total and 4% on an organic basis despite the fact we continue to experience pressure with our Freight Matching businesses and the impact on Foundry related to the recent actor strike and writer strike. EBITDA margins continue to be strong at 55.9% and grew about 10% and year-over-year. As we dig into the details of it, we'll start with our Freight Matching businesses, DAT & Loadlink which declined slightly as expected due to the challenging freight market conditions that affected each of these businesses. 
 As is typical for Roper, we invest for long-term sustainable and improving levels of organic growth. In DAT's case, we're leading the industry with GenAI-enabled fraud detection and prevention tools. As many know, fraud across the transport ecosystem remains a cause of great concern and economic loss.
 Turning to Foundry, which continues to innovate at an impressive clip both in terms of major product enhancements and customer productivity-based AI/ML innovations. That said, Foundry declined a bit in the quarter as expected, given the recent industry strikes. Notwithstanding the headwinds of DAT, Loadlink and Foundry, we grew 4% organically in this segment based on the strength across the balance of this portfolio.
 Specifically, iPipeline, our life insurance and annuities network software business had strong renewals, customer expansions and market activity, especially in the annuities market. ConstructConnect continued its solid mark but improved financial results and enhanced its network value with GenAI-powered solutions. And MHA had a strong quarter, benefiting from increased operational focus and rigor revenue timing related to one of MHA's data partnerships and improvement in senior care occupancy rates.
 For the balance of the year, although we did a touch better than expected in the first quarter, we continue to expect to see low single-digit organic revenue growth for this segment based on the continued difficult freight market conditions and our view that foundries recovery will be extended through this year. 
 Now please turn to Page 11, and let's review our TEP segment's results. Revenues here grew 17% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins remained strong at 34.3%. Neptune continued to see notable customer demand, in particular for their ultrasonic meters and meter data management software. In short, Neptune delivered another quarter of growth. Verathon had very strong growth across all 3 of its product families and executed at an exceptional level in the quarter. 
 Of note, Verathon had a record number of large account wins further demonstrating their market momentum. Great job by team Verathon. We also had strong execution and growth led by healthcare end markets from CIVCO, Inovonics, IPA and rf IDEAS.  
 As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, let us remind you that we expected to have a stronger first quarter, which we delivered. That said, for the balance of the year, we expect to see organic revenue for this segment to be in the high single-digits area. 
 Now please turn to Page 13. Now let's review our increased full year 2024 guidance and discuss our Q2 outlook. Based on our strong Q1 results, enterprise momentum and our confidence in our outlook, we are raising our guidance for 2024. For the full year, we now expect total revenue to grow in the 12% area, up from our initial guide of 11% to 12%. Organic revenues to grow about 6%, up from 5% to 6% originally and adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $18.05 and $18.25, up from $17.85 to $18.15 previously.  
 Our guidance continues to assume a full year effective tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. For Q2, we expect adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $4.42 and $4.46. Now please turn it to Page 14, and we'll open it up for your questions. As per custom, we'll conclude with the same key takeaways with which we started.  
 First, we delivered another strong quarter results. Second, we're increasing our outlook for the full year. And third, we are very well positioned relative to capital deployment. For the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, adjusted DEPS and free cash flow with margin expansion and very strong cash flow conversion. Also in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Procare Solutions, which is a great addition to our enterprise and our application software segment.
 And we're increasing our full year 2024 guidance for total revenue, organic revenue and DEPS reflecting our confidence in our outlook and continued momentum. Finally, we continue to maintain a strong financial position with $4 billion plus of capacity for capital deployment. The M&A markets are very active. We have a very robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities that we're excited to pursue with our unbiased and disciplined approach. 
 We're quite bullish about our ability to execute this part of our strategy over the course of 2024. Now as we turn to your questions, and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel, we'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment, so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve the organic growth rates and underlying business quality.
 Finally, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow over a long arc of time in the mid-teens area.  
 With that, we'd like to thank you for your continued interest and support and open the floor to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. 
Julian Mitchell: Maybe just a first question on the network software division. So the freight markets, I think there was a fairly sort of down the outlook from some of the U.S. trucking companies in the past couple of weeks. It sounds like that business for you on Freight Matching is playing out as expected. 
 Are we expecting sort of down-low single digits for the balance of the year in the freight match business? Is that what you're kind of dialing in? And any comments on where we are on the sort of carrier consolidation? 
Neil Hunn: Why don't you take Jason the first one, I'll say the second one. 
Jason Conley: So Julian, it's -- like you said, it's about playing out as we expected, down low singles for the year. Not much change from our perspective last quarter. So yes, that's kind of the current guiding assumption. 
Neil Hunn: And as far as on the carrier side, it's actually been pretty stable for the last several months. It hasn't improved. It has been stable. And when you take that stability and you put it against the prior year comp, that's what drives to the outlook for the year. 
Julian Mitchell: That's helpful. And then just dialing in on the second quarter EPS guide. I think normally, you'd have maybe sort of a 3%, 4% type sequential increase in earnings in the second quarter, looks like it's basically flat at the guide midpoint for this Q2, is there anything going on sort of sequentially with any of the segment sales or margins that's abnormal or something below the line that's weighing on that? 
Jason Conley: No, not really. I mean we feel good about our guidance being raised for the full year. And if you look -- we look back a quarter ago, our Q2 guidance is consistent with what we thought 90 days ago. So I think if you go back to like '21 and '22, we were actually flat Q1 to Q2 on like a segment EBITDA basis. And that's usually the normal motion for us. Last year, we did move up sequentially, but that was driven by some [indiscernible], there were some strong deliveries led by Verathon and then this year, Verathon is coming out strong out of the gate. So we don't have that dynamic this year. 
 And then usually, AS steps down a little bit in earnings due to some Vertafore timing, but we didn't have that dynamic last year. So I think we feel good about sort of the progression from Q1 to Q2 on an operating basis. And in terms of the second half, we'll start to see the accretion of Procare with this -- it's got sequential growth throughout the year and then we'll have, of course, reduced interest expense as we pay down the revolver. So I feel pretty good about the progression going throughout 2024. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. 
Deane Dray: Since it's the newest addition to the team on Procare, just some data points. So what was the contribution in the quarter? And reminds us about any kind of seasonality on the cash flow because it is tied to education. So we know that it tends to be seasonal. And any sort of like first 100-day plans for the business? 
Neil Hunn: Yes. So if I can hit that, Deane. So it was about what we expected. We had a couple more days in, but it was a little over $20 million of revenue came in sort of about as we expected in terms of EBITDA margin in the mid-30s or so. And then I think what we -- from a cash flow perspective, it's more of a monthly sort of payment stream. So we don't get -- it's not like a frontline where they've got big renewals and the schools are paying them. 
 This is childhood education centers that are just sort of paying on a monthly basis, of course, there's a payment stream there, too, that we get that comes on a monthly basis. So it's more consistent throughout the year. And I think we're just off to a really good start in terms of the integration work.
 Of course, teams are quickly up and running from a financial standpoint. We're working through all the normal integration points around insurance and cyber and things like that. And then beyond that, we've been engaged in weekly conversations on progress against some defined value creation levers that we had around growth, and those are going really well. And super collaborative teams digging in and we're really on track for the milestones we agreed upon right after close. So just feeling really good about the momentum there. 
Deane Dray: And the normal cadence for the monthly is revenue cadence is approximately what? 
Neil Hunn: It's consistent, right? So it's just -- if you think about software is obviously consistent month-to-month. And then the payments, they might get a little bit more at the beginning of the year, but it's modest. It's pretty consistent throughout the year. Of course, they're growing, right? So it's going to -- it will ramp up sequentially throughout the year. But just overall, in terms of a business model, it's pretty consistent throughout the year, not a lot of seasonality. 
Zack Moxcey: If you're comparing this to front line, where most of the cash flow comes in Q3, this is not that. This is much more linear throughout the course of the year. 
Deane Dray: That's great. And then just a follow-up on the fastest growth platform right now is surprisingly on the tech-enabled products, Neptune is just how -- what's expectations for this growth rate? How much of this -- because we see similar numbers at like Badger meter. So it looks in line, but how much of this is market growth versus any sort of share gains that you might be realizing? 
Neil Hunn: Yes. So for a long -- Deane, as you know, Neptune over a long arc of time is a slow and steady share gainer for sure. I think it proves out in all the market data we see and continues to research it. Relative short-term performance, we think it's a combination of a couple of things. 
 First is there has been -- they're working through an unprecedented amount of backlog. So that has certainly happened. But then when COVID happened and the Northeast, in particular, where a lot of the meter sets or inside people's homes versus outside, there was basically a stall of that activity yet the customers -- our customers still have obligations to stay on their maintenance schedules. 
 So if there was 1 year, 1.5 years of slower maintenance schedule sort of execution, that's being deployed now. We think that's happening over a 3-, 4-year period. So if you will, maybe 5 or 5.5 years demand squeezed into 4. So that's the market dynamic that's driving some of the growth that we're very much in the midst of. We expect that to continue well in the next year. 
 Final thing I'd say is there's just nice momentum on the new technologies that Neptune has in the field, both in terms of solid state  ultrasonic meters, both on the resi side and large commercial side as well as just the cellular and the meter data management software that we have that really helps our customers have better network connectivity. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Vruwink with Baird. 
Joseph Vruwink: When you consider the businesses that serve clients in the public sector, how are they planning for the balance of the year, just particularly around the election and then the end of stimulus in certain cases? And I ask about stimulus not because a business like frontline has benefited from that. But does just the shifting of revenue sources for a school district perhaps cause a pause in their decision-making? 
Neil Hunn: Yes. So we got -- it depends on which part of the market you're talking about. Education, our frontline business was not and has not been a meaningful beneficiary of [ ESR ] funding. And so as that is coming to an end, we've not been a direct beneficiary of that. There might be some secondhand or thirdhand benefit by that, just having school districts having a lot of money over the last years and feeling good about life. 
 But we've not -- none of what -- we don't believe anything that we sell has been directly funded by [ ESR ] funding. So the pipeline coverage -- first of all, frontline had a very solid first quarter booking. Pipeline on the second quarter is very good. And so we're cautiously optimistic there. 
 The other part of the market that we've talked about is on U.S. Federal Government contractors, the enterprise class, the largest customers, the largest government contractors just with the uncertainty of government spending that has been a more tepid macro environment and slower on the bookings front on the largest of the customers. The SMB portion of that market actually has been quite strong for Deltek. So if you want to talk about other parts of portfolio happy to do it. But Jason, anything you want to add to that? 
Joseph Vruwink: Yes, yes. No, those are the 2 that I had in mind. And then if I can ask, I guess this is a pretty targeted segment level question. But the reoccurring revenue sources for application software really look like they jumped this period, maybe about 2 points more in growth contribution than typically you see there. Just what drives that particular part of the business? 
Neil Hunn: Yes. Joe, that's the Procare business coming online, right? So we talked about 75% or so of their revenue is payments. And so that's showing up in the recurring line. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. 
Scott Davis: I think this was more positive in tone on the M&A side commentary wise, and I think we usually get from you guys. You're never really that bearish. But talk to us about -- a couple of things, a little bit more color there. Is it the number of deals? Is it the valuations have gotten more interesting? Is it the competition on the buy side has gotten a little bit better? I mean just drill down a little bit into that, it would be helpful. And kind of a natural secondary is you say $4 billion of fire price, is that enough? And would you consider tapping equity markets if the deal flow was going to be even more robust? 
Neil Hunn: A lot in there, Jason and I'll do our best to cover all points, if we don't cover one pull us, I'll bring it back to it. So we're very optimistic at the moment. I think it's for really all the reasons you talk about. So there are a very large number of deals in the market and coming to the market. 
 We have very good instrumentation relationships with both the sponsors and all the investment banker intermediaries, the bankers, pipelines are full. And so there is just a lot of stuff coming. So why is that? There was essentially not a lot of stuff for [ 18 ] or so months prior. So in the private equity world, it's all about DPI and getting money back to the LPs. 
 The LP pressure is mounted to the point where they want the capital return. And so we're just going to compress 2.5 years worth of deals in 1 year, 1.5 years. And so there's going to be a lot of activity. Relative to the competition point, because of this -- this is our belief, my belief for a window of time here that the asset class of private equity that we compete with is going to be a net seller of assets versus a net buyer here for a period of time. 
 So Procare is an indication for what's to come, then the competition is less. It's not without competition, but it is less than we've seen for in prior periods, which leads to valuation. I mean if you look at the Procare valuation, I mean that was a very high growth, very high quality business at a very reasonable price. I think it's really a combination of the volume of deals that maybe our view on competition. We'll also I mean any of this -- the number of deals is almost for sure going to happen. 
 This concept of competition could change at any moment. But that's our -- that's what's fueling sort of our optimism. To your point about this $4 billion enough, we're just always about the cash flow compounding of the enterprise being investment grade, using the leverage and being unbiased and disciplined in our approach. And so we're going to stay true to that and look at every deal on a deal-by-deal basis. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. 
Unknown Analyst: This is David on for Brent. I wanted to ask around there was increased commentary, I think, versus prior quarter around some of the companies and what they're doing around AI. Just if you could just give us an update on the broader AI strategy? And if you guys are charging for any of these AI products, any color there would be helpful on how AI could possibly help with the organic growth of some of your assets in the long term, that would be helpful. 
Neil Hunn: Yes. We'll certainly give you an update on that. So we continue to grind away at this. So we have done a lot of work engaging with all 28 of our businesses, both on the internal productivity-based applications around R&D, customer for live customer support go-to-market, admin, HR, finance, regulatory, et cetera, have a call at lunch with a large group of our leaders today on just that topic. 
 We're starting to see some early wins on productivity, like most of us are in code assistance, marketing content generation, things like that. So cautiously optimistic about productivity enhancements. As it relates more directly to your question around products and the market and monetization. This is going to be a slow and steady race about how do you use these tools to create incremental value for our customers. 
 Again, you know we compete on intimacy. That intimacy leads us to know very specific problems and very specific questions that need to be addressed. We have a new technology set to be able to do that. Companies that have products in the market today using GenAI, Aderant, Deltek, DAT, ConstructConnect and Foundry by our account, there may be a few others. Two quarters ago, I think that the count was 0. And so we like the momentum in that regard. 
 In terms of monetization, it's still early days. Our belief -- like for the moment at least, we're monetizing the GenAI investments by having -- by adding that toolset and capability to our existing products in unique ways and then that is creating more value in the products, which is driving in almost all cases, bookings acceleration with those products, and in some cases, higher price points because of the value that's achieved through the tools. 
 So that's where I leave it. Happy to follow up, say, if you want to add, Jason. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. 
Terrell Tillman: Maybe just the first question because it is the most recent addition to the portfolio, and I think you all calculated the opportunity here maybe to continue buying high-quality assets, but maybe even some better growth profiles, good valuations. I'm curious, just an update on where you see kind of on a go-forward basis, the Procare Solutions revenue compounding growth rate where you see that? And then as you've had a little bit of time here, where do you see one of the most untapped growth engines for that? And then I had a quick follow-up for Jason. 
Neil Hunn: Yes. So on Procare when we announced the deal, we talked about how we believe, this is going to be a mid-teens organic growth business. The market is growing 10% or a little north of that. Procare is about 1.5x relative market share. And so with that leadership position and market growth, broker has the right to win that big share and grow above market. 
 In terms of your question, Terry, is bolt-on activity inside of Procare, there's a couple of areas that Janet and her team with the leadership team at Procare are exploring, we. Tuck in a couple of bolt-on type products that sell into the network. But I think at Procare, the bolt-ons are going to be modest on a go-forward basis. 
Terrell Tillman: Got it. Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I think it was 5% to 6% organic growth and now you've firmly set 6%, so that's good to see. Jason, if you had to think about like what is the biggest driver or maybe it's just a bunch of little things. What is the biggest swing factor in just tightening that and effectively raising the organic? 
Jason Conley: Yes. I mean, obviously, we had a really strong Q1. So part of that is just carrying that through and a lot of that was at TEP and then we had some various small beats across software. So I think it's mainly what we saw in Q1 and then just the confidence that we're going to be able to sort of maintain our prior guidance for the out quarters. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. 
Joseph Giordano: Just curious on the jobs in the country, like you look at the jobs data and they're pretty good, but it's generally been like an erosion of white collar type jobs replaced by like part-time blue-collar jobs. And I'm just curious like on a longer term, what are the implications on some of your software businesses that are more headcount driven? Is that trend? I know you won't see it like immediately, but is that -- are you starting to see the implications of that like an outlook basis? 
Neil Hunn: So I would say no, but perhaps the reason is very -- there's some, but very little of our revenue is seat-based pricing. There's some, like I said, -- and where that exists, we're transitioning to a different metric. So as you get more disruption with GenAI or the knowledge workers sort of get more productive, we certainly want to benefit by that, not be penalized by that. But it's not been something that's been brought up by any of our companies in any of our operating or strategy reduce. 
Joseph Giordano: Interesting. Okay. And then just to follow up on the AI discussion in terms of like deployments and the products you're launching here. Has that been like table stakes now? Or is your competition doing the same? Or do you feel like deploying these tools has been a differentiation for your businesses? 
Neil Hunn: So far, it's been very differential. I think the expectation is the competitors will have their response for sure. I'm just double-click on that a bit, though, which is we tend -- we are across all 20 of our businesses, we operate in these very small markets, and we are the largest player in the small market. 
 So we have that advantage around scale in these small markets to be able to do more product development, do more research and development, do more -- invest more and go to market to get these tools there. And so that is a long-term advantage that we have and why we select the businesses we do to be part of the portfolio. The other thing is when you compete on intimacy with Generative AI, all these verticals that we have, we obviously have the knowledge and the content and the data. And that's only half the question. The other half the problem. The other half of the problem, though, is we are so -- we compete on intimacy so we actually know what questions to answer. So we have the content, the data and the question and now the Generative AI, it's just another tool in the toolkit about how to solve those problems. So we like our long-term competitive positions. 
Joseph Giordano: Just on that, if I could just sneak in a follow-up on that. Like is this an area -- I know generally, once you acquire a business that kind of runs on its own, but is this an area where like the corporate can flex a little bit because these solutions tend to be expensive to deploy. 
 So is this an area where like Roper corporate could be like all we are making a decision to kind of allocate capital to the businesses that need this specifically outside of the natural free cash flow dynamics of that specific firm? 
Neil Hunn: So these tools are not free, but they are substantially less expensive than these large language models that have to be developed, right? And so there is the research and development part of the application of the LLM and what we're doing, and then there's the operational costs. Jason did a teach-in a couple of months ago about the ROI case studies and all of this stuff. 
 So far, we've not seen an ROI case study that's been challenged in any meaningful way on this front. I'm sure that will happen as you start to work down the curve of opportunities. But we're not -- at the moment, we're not going to try to do a one-size-fits-all Roper Generative AI solution because it would just not work because of the 28 different applications. Jason, anything you want to add. 
Jason Conley: Yes. No, that's right. I mean we do have benefits and scale with some of the agreements with our large cloud service providers. So that's been beneficial for companies to do some experimentation at a very low cost. And then we're just allocating a lot of mind share towards that, so we can collectively get better. But in terms of like allocating capital that just hasn't been front-centered out. The company has a really compelling value proposition. We're always going to entertain that, but that's not what we're seeing today. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. 
Joseph Ritchie: So in your prepared comments, Neil, you referenced how some of your new SaaS-based offerings were helping certain businesses. I'm just curious as you kind of think a look at the portfolio as a whole, like how far along are you in terms of rolling out additional new platforms? And how much room is there to go from here? And if there are any examples that you want to highlight, that would be great across the portfolio. 
Neil Hunn: So I just want to make sure we understand it or answering the question you're asking is that essentially how far along are we on our SaaS journey? And what's that look like? 
Joseph Ritchie: Yes, that's exactly right. And if there are examples across the portfolio where you think you're -- you have like additional opportunity, I'd love to just hear about some of those examples. 
Neil Hunn: So Jason why don't you take on the first part, I'll take the second part. 
Jason Conley: Yes. At the macro level, we're a little over $900 million of maintenance today, maintenance revenue and if you go back maybe in the last 5 years, we've converted the base of maintenance probably like in the mid- to high single-digit area. So we still have a lot of room left, and we convert that maintenance revenue at 2 to 2.5x when we go to SaaS. And so that's kind of where we're at today. 
 And there's a -- Neil can talk about the specific businesses. There's a handful of businesses that are transitioning. I'd say Aderant is one that's probably had the biggest migration over the last 3 or 4 years, which happened right at co -- that was an industry that was reluctant to move to the cloud and then all of a sudden, once a few firms when they all win. So they're right in the in the thick of things in terms of that cloud migration. But Neil, do you want to talk about some other. 
Neil Hunn: As Jason said, I mean, it is this $900 million of on-premise maintenance is concentrated in a handful of businesses. The examples we give would start with Deltek. It's both on the cost point, which is our government contracting core product and Vantage Point, which is their private sector, their engineering, architecture product.
 You might have seen, for instance, on cost point, this quarter, Deltek achieved FedRAMP Moderate ready status. So there is a requirement the government puts on for security. It's a meaningful checkpoint for cost point in the cloud, almost all net new for the private sector part of Deltek's book is sole and Vantage Point, which is in the cloud and SaaS enabled. Jason talked about Aderant, 80-plus percent of all of Aderant bookings today are in the cloud, talked about PowerPlan. PowerPlan has one, a handful of core applications. I would say their #2 application is cloud-enabled and being deployed today. So we're definitively rolling through that book in that product set and building into this long-term SaaS business. 
Joseph Ritchie: Got it. That's super helpful. I'll just leave it there. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Brad Hewitt with Wolfe Research. 
Bradley Hewitt: So you talked about the strength that pipeline in the quarter. I saw you announced a new CFO for that business with a focus on kind of driving the long-term growth strategy. Just wondering if you could update us on kind of the normalized growth profile of that business and what you see as kind of the biggest opportunities to perhaps accelerate growth in that business going forward. 
Neil Hunn: Yes, I'll take the first part. I'll let Jason talk about the growth outlook. So -- it's not -- I mean, we have a new president there, Pat McDonald. He is just hired as new CFO, as you referenced, really like the leadership mindset, the competitive orientation, the learning orientation, the building capability to be able to take long term, in that short term that the new leader brings to iPipeline. 
 His predecessor [indiscernible], he's been a long-term Roper leader, did a great job for a couple of years setting that business up. Retention is super strong, love sort of the market -- this company is really poised for market share gains. It's good market focus. The competitive environment, one, is tilting our direction for sure. The business has network effects. So I really like the momentum and what we're poised to do in that business. And then, Jason, I will let you take the growth question. 
Jason Conley: Yes. I mean I think it's playing out as we thought it would when we acquired it back in 2018, 2019 area, it's in the high single-digit plus range and maybe it tilt a little higher down the road. But that's sort of where it's tracking. And just Adam Boone was added to the team a month ago, and we're excited about him joining along with Pat. So we're excited about the process for our pipeline. 
Bradley Hewitt: Okay. Great. And then it looks like growth in network in Q1 was maybe a few points better than expected. Your guidance for the rest of the year kind of implies revenue flattish sequentially on an absolute basis. 
 I would assume most of the businesses in that segment would see kind of modest sequential growth throughout the year. So just kind of trying to understand if there are any potential offsets that maybe if that's DAT. Just any thoughts on kind of sequentials relative to Q1 levels in network. 
Jason Conley: Yes, sure. So we talked a little bit about MHA had a really strong quarter, and we think they're still -- they're going to continue to grow this year. But Q1 was especially strong as they had a contract renegotiations. So we got a little bit of a bump in organic growth in the first quarter. And then DAT & Loadlink, they'll continue to be down this year. And so maybe a touch lower than Q1. So that's what's driving the sort of low single digits throughout the rest of the year. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. 
Patrick Baumann: Lot of ground been covered. Just a couple of cleanups here. Sticking with the Network Software segment, it's seen really good margin expansion for a couple of quarters now. Could you remind us what's driving that? And if this 56%, 57% is sustainable and could potentially move up further in coming quarters? 
Neil Hunn: Yes. So we touched on this last year, just DAT getting ahead of where they saw the market was going and taking some of the fixed costs out of the business. And so we're just realizing that through the first 3 quarters of this year. We think the margins in that -- I don't think it's going to get -- it's going to expand further. We're sort of in the 55%, 56% range. We expect that to continue throughout the year. 
Patrick Baumann: Okay. Got it. And then lastly, just the second quarter. Any color you could give us on organic growth expectations? I know you gave it for 2Q to 4Q. Any difference between second quarter and that 2Q to 4Q guide? And then also on free cash flow, typically lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. So wondering if you could give any kind of color on that relative to the first quarter. 
Neil Hunn: Yes. I mean I think the organic growth expectations are the same in the second quarter as they are for the year. So no real big swings there. And then cash flow on the second quarter, it's always the quarter that we make to federal tax payments. So it's always the lowest of the year. So that's really the only dynamic I would point out there. If you look over prior years, that's always our low point, but still expect to grow, of course. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Alexander Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management. 
Alexander Blanton: I noticed that you're forecasting or guiding to organic growth of 6% for the year, correct? But you had 8% in the first quarter. So are you factoring in some economic weakness in the U.S. in that forecast? 
Jason Conley: No. I mean, I think it all plays out, Alex, in our products segment and our TEP segment over the first quarter, we just had a better compare and just the ramp that we had in Neptune last year, it's sort of the comps sort of normalize out in the balance of the year. So it's really just that. It's no more complicated than that. And so that's why Q1 was -- and that's -- when we came into the year, that's what we had indicated that Q1 was going to be the kind of the high mark in terms of organic unless things change in our assumptions. 
Neil Hunn: And I would just add, Alex, to what Jason said, we assume that there is the freight conditions and whatnot that, that is muted, but we've assumed that all the way through, it's not a new assumption, but there is definitely back half macroeconomic weak impacts in that part of our business. That did not change, but it's embedded from our original guidance. 
Alexander Blanton: And which part of the business? I missed that. 
Neil Hunn: The transportation part, the DAT & Loadlink inside of network, the Freight Matching business. 
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks. 
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-01-31 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now, if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our Safe-Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, the financial impacts associated with our minority investments in Indicor and Certinia. And lastly, transaction-related expenses associated with our completed acquisitions. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our quite good 2023 fourth quarter and full-year results with you this morning. As we turn to Page 5, let's look at today's agenda. This morning, I'll start by walking through our full-year highlights and then we'll turn to commenting on our most recent acquisition, Procare Solutions. Jason will then go through our quarterly results, both in aggregate and at the segment level, share our annual results and review our strong balance sheet position, then I'll pick up and discuss our segment level annual results, our 2024 outlook, wrap up, and turn to your questions. Let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the two key takeaways for today's call are; first, we delivered a very strong 2023; and second, we remain well-positioned and are carrying positive momentum into 2024. As we look back on the full-year, we're proud of what the organization accomplished. From a financial perspective, we delivered 15% revenue growth, 16% EBITDA growth and 32% free cash flow growth, with free cash flow margins at 32%. Our total revenue growth of 15% was underpinned with 8% organic revenue growth. Jason will cover this in a few minutes, but Q4 was strong as well with 13% total revenue growth and 8% organic revenue growth. Also during the year, we deployed $2.1 billion in the high-quality vertical software acquisitions, highlighted by our bolt-on acquisitions of Syntellis and Replicon. As we all know, last year was a challenged year relative to available acquisition opportunities, given that I'm super-proud of our team's ability to grind through the market conditions and successfully convert two outstanding value-creation M&A opportunities. Given all this, we entered this year with positive momentum. We continue to see strong demand for our mission-critical solutions. As a reminder, each of our businesses is a leader in their respective market and delivers system of record, network critical or vital and-or lifesaving technologies. As a result, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions. Also as we head into 2024, we have meaningful contributions from our recent acquisitions, Syntellis, Replicon, and Procare. It is important to highlight these additions to our portfolio of businesses also improved the underlying quality of our enterprise in terms of reoccurring revenue mix and organic growth profile. Finally, we continue to be very active in the M&A market, in environment that we expect to be notably improved in 2024 with a strong balance sheet and a large pipeline of attractive opportunities. So, a strong '23 and solid momentum both organic and inorganic behind us as we enter 2024. Now please turn to the next page, Page 6, where I will discuss our most recent acquisition, Procare Solutions. Procare Solutions is a fantastic addition to the Roper portfolio. Let's start with the fundamentals. We're paying $1.75 billion net of $110 million tax benefit for the business. We expect Procare to contribute about $260 million of revenue and $95 million of EBITDA for the 12 months ended Q1 '25. Procare will be accretive to our free cash flow in '24 and to our adjusted DEPS in '25. We will fund the acquisition with a portion of our $3.5 billion revolver, and we'll report Procare in our Application Software segment and expect the deal to close this quarter. Procare meets all our longstanding acquisition criteria, leader in a smaller market, delivers mission-critical verticalized software solutions, competes based on customer intimacy, operates in asset-light business model, and is led by a skilled passionate leadership team. What' incrementally different for us is the maturing leader nature of this company. As we outlined during our Investor Day last year, our corporate strategy leans on implementing two modest improvements. First, continue to improve our long-term sustainable organic growth rate. And second, capture more value from our capital appointment capacity. Relative to additional capital deployment value capture, we are focusing on doing a higher proportion of bolt-on activity as evidenced by last year's capital deployment records and adding higher-growth or maturing leader business profiles to our enterprise. Procare is a prototypical maturing leader archetype, meeting all our longstanding criteria that I mentioned above, but as structurally faster growth business that possesses the opportunity to improve margins as the top-line scales. For Procare, we expect mid-teens top-line growth with improving margins from an already strong position for the years to come. Let's talk about what the company does. Procare is the leading provider of mission-critical and purpose-built software to 37,000 owners and operators of early childhood education centers which they used to run their business. The software provides all the needed functionality to run the childcare center ranging from parents and family engagement, staff and teachers scheduling, classroom management, tuition billing and payment processing. The market itself is quite attractive. And in the midst of a long-term secular tailwind of young dual income families seeking higher levels of early childhood education versus daycare. In addition, like most industries, this one is undergoing long-term tech-enablement. Given these factors, this market is growing annually in the low double digits area. As mentioned, Procare is the leading player with a 1.5 times through all their market-share advantage in this space given their super compelling value proposition that combines both software and the integrated payment capabilities. Given this, Procare has very high gross retention and compelling net retention as well. Finally, from a extensive due diligence of the business, we are encouraged by the fact that Procare has multiple strategic and operating pathways available to deliver mid-teens growth and long-term margin expansion. Net-net, this is a highly compelling value creation opportunity for Roper, and our shareholders. And to Joanne, your leadership team and all the Procare family, welcome to Roper. So with that, Jason, let me turn the call over to you so you can walk-through our fourth quarter and full-year results, as well as our very strong financial position. Jason?
Jason Conley: Great. Thanks, Neil. I'll walk-through the enterprise and segment results for Q4, and enterprise results for the full-year along with a review of our balance sheet. Starting with Q4 on Slide 7. We had an excellent finish to a strong year, revenue over $1.6 billion was 13% over prior year, led by 8% organic growth with acquisitions adding four points and less than a point of currency benefit. Organic outperformance was led by our TEP segment, highlighted by Neptune and Verathon. Gross margin of 69.7% was down 30 basis points versus prior year given the higher mix coming from our TEP segment. EBITDA grew 11% to $659 million with EBITDA margin coming in at a solid 40.8%. With the offsetting impact of interest and taxes, this translated into DEPS growth of 11% to $4.37, above our guidance range of $4.28 to $4.32. Also from a cash perspective, free cash flow finished strong at $596 million, up 30% over prior year. This was in-line with our expectations with a good renewal season across our software businesses. We turn to Slide 8, I'll briefly click into the segment performance in Q4. Application Software delivered revenue growth of 15% over prior year to $852 million with organic growth contributing seven points and the balance coming primarily from our bolt-on acquisitions of Syntellis and Replicon. EBITDA margin of 43.2% in the quarter was below prior year's high watermark of 45.6%, which as we discussed last year, was driven by lower incentive-based compensation. Network Software was up 3% to $363 million with EBITDA up 10% to $208 million. As we have discussed before, our freight matching businesses are navigating a drawdown of carriers, following exceptional marketplace growth over 2021 and 2022, which is mixing down the growth rate for the segment. However, our business leaders DAT and Loadlink have aligned the cost base with reduced carrier subscribers to still drive solid EBITDA growth in the quarter. Our TEP segment grew by 17% in the quarter to $399 million with EBITDA of 13% to a $134 million. Growth was led by exceptional performance at Neptune, with continued increasing demand for ultrasonic technologies and overall favorable market conditions. Also Verathon continued its remarkable growth with strengthened single-use products across Laryngoscopy and Bronchoscopy. EBITDA margin of 33.6% was down from prior year given some one-time investments and incentive compensation in the quarter. Turning to Slide 9, I'll walk through our full-year 2023 performance. As Neil just mentioned, revenue was just under $6.2 billion, up 15% over prior year with organic growth of 8% and acquisitions contributing seven points, mainly Frontline and Syntellis. Looking at a three-year revenue CAGR on this slide, similar to 2023, it's also at 15%. Further, the organic -- average organic growth rate over the three-year period has been about 8%. So as Neil mentioned, we benefited from some market conditions over that time period. EBITDA of just over $2.5 billion was up 16% over prior year yielding EBITDA margin of 40.6%. Our three-year EBITDA over this period was also up 16%. So the story remains the same at Roper. We own and continually grow a portfolio of high gross margin businesses and generally convert EBITDA -- growth to EBITDA in the 45% range, which allows for ample investment back into the business for future sustainable growth. Free cash flow for the year was just shy of $2 billion, which represents a 32% margin and is coincidentally up 32% over 2022. Full-year contribution from our Frontline acquisition and excellent performance across the enterprise drove this result, underpinned by strong renewals, favorable DSO and improving inventory turns. Of note, our net working capital as a percent of annualized revenue was negative 19% in Q4 to the new record for Roper. Importantly, over a three-year period, we have compounded cash flow at 16%. Our consistent focus on growing cash flow and the strength of our new portfolio following our divestitures demonstrates a solid base from which to continue our long-term growth algorithm. To that end, we expect free cash flow margin to be 30% or more in 2024. With that, we can flip to Slide 10 to discuss our strong financial position. From a liquidity standpoint, we finished the year with $3.14 billion available on our revolver, with over $200 million of cash. Regarding leverage, we brought down net-debt to EBITDA from 2.7 times at the beginning of 2023, to a year end figure of 2.4 times despite deploying $2.1 billion towards acquisitions. We expect to close on Procare later in Q1 and will utilize our revolver to fund the transaction. So this will be our pro-forma leverage to about 3 times. Our solid balance sheet coupled with strong cash generation gives us capacity to deploy $4 billion or more of capital, while remaining committed to our solid investment-grade rating. Since our October call, deal activity has demonstrably increased with a corresponding lift in asset quality. That said, our market optimism remains balanced by our disciplined process in patient posture. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Neil to talk about our full-year segment performance and the indications for 2024. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Jason. As we turn to Page 12, let's look-back on the year for our Application Software segment. Total revenues grew 21% and organic revenues grew 6% to $3.19 billion, while EBITDA margins remained strong at 43.7%. Within the segment, results were consistent with strength at Deltek, Aderant, Vertafore, Strata and Frontline. Deltek continued to see strong gains in our SaaS solutions, especially in the private sector markets. As discussed throughout the year, the GovCon market was tempered given all the uncertainty regarding government spending, notwithstanding Deltek delivered mid-single-digit organic growth for the year. In addition, they continue to innovate and add capabilities during times of uncertainty, which is a hallmark of Roper strategy, highlighted by the bolt-ons of Replicon and ProPricer. ProPricer, a smaller transaction about $80 million purchase price that closed late last year and delivers the leading contract pricing solutions and software for government contractors and federal agencies, an ideal strategic fit for Deltek's cost point product family. Aderant was just amazing last year. They had record bookings and significant adoption of their anchor SaaS solutions and add-on products. Also, Aderant is one of the leaders within Roper and the legal software market as it relates to productizing generative AI solutions within their product stack. Great job by Chris, Rossi, and the entire team at Aderant. Continuing on, Vertafore was solid with strong ARR gains throughout the year. Additionally, Vertafore made great strides with our product strategy deployment and the MGA systems bolt-on is trending well-ahead of our investment case. Strata also was quite good last year, both in terms of organic ARR gains, and their acquisition and integration work associated with Syntellis. Finally, Frontline executed well, delivering strong retention and cash flow during the year. As I mentioned earlier, we will report Procare solutions in this segment and expect the deal to close this quarter. As it relates to our 2024 outlook for this segment, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. Please turn with us to Page 13. Full-year organic revenue for our Network segment grew 5% to $1.44 billion and margins were strong at 55.2%. We'll start with our freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink, which both grew in the year despite the year long muted freight market conditions. Similar to that of Deltek, both businesses continue to innovate during the sluggish market with particularly interesting Gen AI innovations at DAT to help combat industry fraud. Pipeline delivered record bookings and had very strong customer retention and expansion activity, leading to strong ARR growth. Foundry, our post-production media and entertainment software business muscled through the year given the writers and actors strikes and made meaningful progress in the transition to a full subscription revenue model. Finally, our alternate site healthcare businesses, MHA, SoftWriters and SHP were strong throughout the year as census levels and senior care facilities improved. As it relates to our full-year 2024 guide for the segment, we expect to see low-single digit organic revenue growth based on the expectation of continued muted freight market conditions, but with continued strong EBITDA margin performance. Now please turn to Page 14 and let's review our TEPs segment's results. Organic revenues for the year grew 15% to $1.55 billion and EBITDA margins remain consistent at 35.3%. As we look back over the year, we entered the year with a high degree of supply-chain uncertainty. During the year, the vast majority of these uncertainties are resolved and our business has done a tremendous job of capturing the opportunity. As we exit '23 and look to '24, we do not see meaningful supply chain constraints. As usual, we'll start with Neptune, our water meter and technology business. Neptune was just great and continues to see strong demand and momentum for their residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters, and increasing adoption of their meter meter data management software. We remain bullish about Neptune and the market in which they compete. Verathon was awesome as well for the year. Verathon was strong across all three of their product families, ultrasonic, bladder volume measurement, video-assisted intubation and single-use Bronchoscopy. As. As a reminder Verathon's reoccurring single-use offerings now make up about 55% of the business' annual revenue stream. Just an amazing product and business execution journey to both scale and improve the underlying quality of the business. Finally, our RF product businesses, Inovonics and rf IDEAS did a terrific job managing through their supply chain challenges and delivered very strong 2023 financial performance. Looking to our 2024 guidance for this segment, we expect to see high single-digit organic revenue growth for the full-year, and the expectation that Q1 will grow in the mid-teens area. Now please turn with us to Page 16. This morning, we're establishing our 2024 full-year and first quarter guidance. For the full-year, which includes the impact of Procare solutions, we expect to see total revenue growth between 11% and 12%. On an organic basis, we expect to see full-year 2024 revenue grow between 5% and 6%. And finally, we expect to see full-year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $17.85 - $18.15, which includes about $0.10 to $0.15 of DEPS dilution associated with the Procare deal. Assumed in this guidance, the tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. We want to take a moment, set our guide in context of our long-term strategy and execution model. To remind everyone, historically we operate at a 5% to 6% organic growth portfolio. Our strategy and ambition to structurally improve organic growth rate to be in the 8% to 9% area. Over the last three years, we grew 8%, 9% and 8% on an organic basis. So these years were benefited to some extent from certain market conditions. As such, our view is our current course and speed of organic growth rate is in the 7% to 7.5% area. We are very pleased with our progress to date and continue to work to achieve organic growth aspirations. As it relates to organic revenue outlook for '24, we enter the year mindful of two factors; continued subdued large customer activity in our Application Software segment and our freight matching businesses within our Network segment being below trend based on our expectations for continued muted freight market conditions. As it relates to the first quarter, we expect to see adjusted DEPS in the range of $4.30 and $4.34. Now please turn with us to Page 17, and then we'll look-forward to your questions. As per our custom, we'll will conclude with the same key takeaways with which we started. One, we delivered another great year performance. And two, we have continued positive momentum heading into 2024. Relative to 2023s performance, we delivered 15% revenue growth, 16% EBITDA growth and 32% free cash flow growth, with free cash flow margins also at 32%. Our total revenue growth of 15% was underpinned by 8% organic revenue growth. Importantly, free cash flow was growing 16% on a three-year compounded basis and we delivered our first-ever quarter of a $1 billion of software recurring and reoccurring revenues, quite an important milestone for enterprise. In addition, we deployed $2.1 billion towards high-quality vertical software acquisitions, highlighted by our bolt-ons of Syntellis and Replicon, and year we're deploying capital was structurally challenged and we did so at very compelling values, leading the strong value creation for shareholders. As we enter 2024, we do so with strong momentum. We continue to see robust demand for our mission-critical solutions, a strong outlook for organic growth. Also, you can count on Roper to improve the underlying business quality as we scale our enterprise. Adding to the momentum for the year are the contributions from our 2023 acquisition cohort and last week's announcement of Procare Solutions. Finally, we are well-positioned to continue our capital deployment execution. We remain very active in the M&A market and environment that expect to be notably improved in 2024. We do this with a strong balance sheet, a large pipeline of attractive opportunities and unwavering levels of patience and discipline. Now as we turn to your questions and if you can flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel. We'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve the organic growth rates and underlying business quality. Finally, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow in the mid-teens area over the long arc of time . So with that, thank you for your continued interest in Roper, and let's open it up to your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Can we just start with Procare, and it's interesting. This is the first time I recall where you made a deal announcement and I had not one but two people at RBC Research contact me and say, hi, that they were you're active customers. And so -- and they show them the apps on their phone and it was really interesting to see that dynamic. And my question here is, I'm really glad that you highlighted how they're a maturing leader and within that category. And what surprises me is how much growth there is, I mean, low-single digit, maybe a low-double-digit to mid-teens. As you start to see that type of growth, might the private equity sellers have a bias, where maybe that's a public company exit, that's always been the kind of adage if you go for these more orphan businesses, there is no public company exit, they're more apt to sell to you at a reasonable price. If you start looking at some of these growth to your businesses like Procare, even at a maturing leader category, might that stretch the multiples because the private equity players might have a public company exit in mind? So maybe we can start there.
Neil Hunn: Yes, so I think -- first, appreciate the comments on Procare. I think there's like 80,000 five-star ratings in the app store. So your colleagues are a couple of many about the liking the application and the engagement with their kids in their early childhood education centers. Relative to the question about the IPO is a competitor, I mean maybe on some transactions, but most of what we're going to look at are going to be sub-scale for the IPO market. The TAM here is sub $1 billion, that's not a very IPO-able type market. So this is again small market leader. The market is growing low-double digits that we talked about, which underpins the mid-teens growth rate we're underwriting to hear. In terms of valuation in multiples, I think we're just in a world where sellers, especially private equity sellers understand the cost of capital, where the world is. They have constraints from their LPs. They need to get liquidity back to them. They can't raise new funds without it. And so, I mean, it's hard to guess with this asset would have traded for 12 months to 18 months ago, but substantially -- substantially higher on a multiple basis. So we think for the moment the valuations are coming to us because of the market for us that we just talked about.
Jason Conley: I think in this current environment liquidity is really key. So, if you do an IPO, you don't get your liquidity right away. So I think that's pretty important
Deane Dray: And this might be more of a nuance, but at your Analyst Day you talked about a willingness to look at businesses that might be at an earlier stage of development. And is -- on that spectrum, this Procare is a maturing leader. Is that something you could have acted sooner on? And when Jason talked about the level of activity, how -- within the funnel are there businesses that are at that earlier-stage that might look attractive?
Neil Hunn: I think Procare is like a perfect example by earlier stage, right? So these are not early-stage companies. They are earlier than what we've typically acquired in the past. So they meet all of our criteria. I have to emphasize that every time we talk about maturing leaders. So it's a leader in a small market. The base, the competition is understood and observable in the marketplace. The relative market share advantage this company has is particularly interesting. So those are common traits of everything we've always acquired. In this case, the market is growing a little bit faster and the underlying business model -- margins are going to scale as the business grows. So that's the earlier part of what we're talking about. Historically, we would have maybe waited by Procare until the next trade, the one after, the one that just occurred. And so when we look at the model of this over a long arc, it's just much more value for our shareholders to do this type of transaction. In terms of the pipeline, it is as Jason said in his comments, as I said in my comments, just a noticeable change in activity since our last call in the marketplace for some of the reasons that we talked about, and it's a variety of opportunities. I mean, we know we're leaning into doing more bolt-ons, so there's a fair amount of bolt-on activity in there. That's a lot of what Jan and her team are working to build, and then there's a fair number of these emerging, maturing leader, excuse me, maturing leader type profiles and will just ask them, we'll be patient and disciplined to figure out the right ones for us.
Deane Dray: That's all great to hear. Thanks. Congratulations.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just following up on Procare. If you could clarify a little bit just the financial impact. I think you said maybe $0.10 to $0.15 hit for the year in that guide. So maybe just sort of clarify around that. Is it kind of a smaller hit in Q1 because of the timing of the deal close and then we just spread the rest out over the balance? Any thoughts on kind of the seasonality of the Procare business and then how quickly you'll get that sort of related debt down?
Jason Conley: Yes, sure, Julian. So we expect to close in March. That's sort of our assumption right now. So the way that plays out is of the $0.15, maybe $0.02 in the first quarter. So we expect for the calendar year around $75 million of EBITDA. And then we'll obviously from an interest perspective, we'll reload on the revolver, which is going to be at around 6%. And so, and obviously, and so that will cast out through the rest of the year. So that's how you get to your $0.10, $0.15 for the year. In terms of seasonality, not a ton of seasonality for the business. And then, of course, it's growing nicely. So that's sort of works through any aberrations you'd have between quarters
Julian Mitchell: That's helpful. Thank you. And then, just homing in on Network Software for a second. So you have that sort of softness in the freight markets, just been sort of well understood for some time. Foundry was also weak for some of last year. So are we thinking that in the context of that low single-digit organic growth guide for the year in Network Software, just trying to understand are you assuming kind of a slower start and then a pickup in the back half? Or it's a steady sort of 3% growth rate dialed in, Just like how you exited 2023?
Neil Hunn: I'll take the first to that and then ask Jason if he wants to add any color. So you're right, the call -- I mean the principal driver of the growth rates in this range for '24 is DAT & Link and freight matching businesses. Foundry had, as we talked about, had a tough '23 with the actors and writers strike. On top of that, they started that migration to a full subscription model. And so, '24 will be a bit muted for Foundry as well, but that's a small relative to the impact of DAT and the Canadian Freight Match businesses. We've assumed sort of muted conditions throughout the whole year. There certainly are market prognosticators that are suggesting a second-half pickup. We've not assumed that in our model. We want to see it before we load it in, and that's our core assumption relative to the Freight Match businesses hitting that.
Julian Mitchell: That's right. Great. Thank you
Operator: And our next question today comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead
Brent Thill: Thanks. Curious just to get the thoughts on organic growth in '24, obviously you've taken a pretty meaningful step down from what you did last year. And maybe if you can explain that in the initial guide and what you're baking in for the overall guide for '24?
Neil Hunn: Sure. I mean it's -- I'll just comment and share a few of the thoughts, we said in the prepared remarks, right? So the our long-term aspirations are to grow organically in that 8% to 9% range and we believe we have the possibility to do that. It's going to take a few more years to get into that run-rate. That's the aspiration of what we're all working towards both in the group executives and all the operating teams across the company. As you know, the last three years there was an 8%, 9%, 8% throughout that whole period of time. We said those were benefited by some market tailwinds, some back from the pandemic, you know, a raging freight market, things like that. Supply chain sort of bottlenecks and releases. And that was sort of in the last three years. So as we look at this year compared to history and then also, or the possible in the arc, we think our current course and speed is in the 7% to 7.5% range organic growth through all that noise. So as we compare, we're doing in '24 against all that, it really is two simple reconciling factors. One is, we just talked about in the last question. The freight markets being slow. Our expectation for them to be slow throughout the whole year. And as we talked about for a few quarters last year in our Application Software segment, there was notably less large customer activity, like enterprise class customer activity. Deltek, a little bit, we talked about Frontline. A little bit of smaller business called Data Innovations, which all makes sense. The large companies anticipating a slowdown. They just got cautious in their buying behavior. The good news is, Deltek ended Q4 with a fair amount of momentum. I think they're up low-double-digit, either high single low-double digits in the quarter. So they exited with a fair amount of momentum, it's one data point. We want to see a few of those thrown together. And so we're -- those are the two reconciling items, the freight slowdown, expectation slowdown in large activity in Application. That's embedded in our model and those are reconciling factors between last year and where we are this year and also pretty much a reconciling factor between where we are this year and where we think we are from a run rate.
Brent Thill: Great. Thank you
Neil Hunn: Yes.
Operator: And our next question comes from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please go ahead
Joe Vruwink: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, I wanted to pick off on the last answered and maybe contextualize a bit more the outlook specifically for Application Software. Appreciate the comments on subdued activity with large accounts. Do you happen to maybe have the trend in Enterprise bookings and then any other forecasting considerations to call out, because I guess I'm trying to reconcile the good step up at year end against the mid-single outlook, but that might just be related to the planning kind of assumptions you just mentioned, Neil?
Neil Hunn: Yes. I think the step up at the year, I mean Deltek was strong in Q4. And it's one data point. The pipeline looks attractive. The pipeline for Frontline looks attractive at both the Enterprise and SMB portion of their business, but we've been through the better part of three, four quarters where the Enterprise activity was slow and we're just not going to underwrite that in our guidance at the moment.
Jason Conley: In terms of Enterprise bookings, they were up low single digits, which is consistent for the full-year this year and sort of consistent with what we've said all year long around -- around just lower activity at the Enterprise level
Joe Vruwink: Okay, great. And then I wanted to ask, there is some exogenous events like you mentioned Foundry. I think they communicated that they are now exclusively subscriptions here in 2024. You also have a lot of other businesses that have big on-prem maintenance streams that can get a multiplier over time. So there's things that are hurting and helping I suppose. Do you have a sense on a blended and net basis what this might be contributing to the model in 2024? And when you think about growth improving from the 7% to 7.5% range, what these types of items might ultimately mean over the next couple of years?
Jason Conley: So I can take the first part of that, Joe, and then maybe Neil can take the second. So in terms of the Application Software, we still expect it to be strong in mid singles. I think nonrecurring revenue will still kind of be flattish. We still expect that sort of shift to SaaS to continue and that's kind of been a small headwind for us throughout in the last couple years, but it's been overcome by the things we talked about, which was Enterprise bookings, which we didn't get-in '23. So, again, recurring is going be strong. Nonrecurring will be flattish. If Deltek picks up in '24, especially in the large GovCon Enterprise, there could be upside in the year because a lot of those customers are still buying on-premise licenses. So that could be an opportunity, but we didn't bake any of that into our guidance. And then when we look at Network, recurring will clearly be down low-single digits just based on DAT & Loadlink, at least based on our current assumptions. And to your point, I think nonrecurring will be fairly muted as well because we'll still be -- will be at the last point of that conversion of Foundry off license to subscription. So they didn't -- they didn't mandate that in '23. They will mandate in '24, so we'll be digesting that last piece there. And then on the 7%, Neil...
Neil Hunn: Yes. I think just more longer-term on the SaaS migration. We have a little bit over $900 million and an on-premise maintenance. That -- as that converts, it converts -- is our recent history, the last two or three or four years it is north of two times on an ARR basis as it converts from on-premise maintenance to SaaS and cloud. So when we do that, it's actually going -- we believe historically it's been a bit of a net growth driver. While we might -- we will convert perpetual licenses which are end period one-time revenue to SaaS and that's a classic J-curve. The companies that are undergoing this transition, we're going to convert this $900 plus million of maintenance at a clip that will overwhelm that J-curve effect. So we believe it's a net growth driver. Foundry is a bit unique, in that they are making a, just a -- almost like a day-one pivot and their business model shift, and the other companies are doing more of a migratory approach
Joe Vruwink: Okay. That's all helpful. Thank you.
Operator: An our next question today comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Allison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to turn to tech-enabled products. Obviously, a strong year. As we think about that guide, Neptune and Verathon are certainly big components of that growth. Does that kind of diverge to some extent as one start to appease the other, it seems like there's a lot of development at Verathon that can drive some of that. Just any thoughts there?
Neil Hunn: So I mean both, and as we talked about, both Neptune and Verathon were just great. And last year both grew faster than the segment. Obviously, they are a predominant element of the segment. We believe that the long-term growth rate at Neptune is probably in the high single digits area. And we believe that the long-term organic growth rate of Verathon is probably a bit higher than that. It's -- we want -- we want to believe that it's going to be a low double digits. We want to see a couple more years of that, some more R&D productivity. We're super encouraged by the pipeline of R&D and the momentum they have in the market across the three product categories. So that's where we expect the long-term growth rates to be there.
Allison Poliniak: Got it. And then just following up on the M&A side of things, leverage at 3 times, obviously strong cash flow generator. But it sounds like the pipeline is incredibly active with quality transactions. What's the comfort level in terms of going above that range? Is there a way to think through that, just any thoughts? Thanks.
Neil Hunn: Yes, I mean, we're always -- our long-term policy is between 3 times to 3.5 times. If you look back to 2015, '16, you can never be right at that level, some you go above it and come below it. It's always this this process and where do you draw a line through those swings. We're going to just -- we're business model pickers. As you know, we're going to continue to look for the very best businesses at the most attractive valuations that meet all of our criteria, and then we'll look for the best way to finance those from that point. We certainly understand, I think acutely risk, both risk in the businesses, risk in the capital structure, and that's a big part of how we think about deploying capital and how we value assets.
Allison Poliniak: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Christopher Glynn: I had a question about the TEP segment. So you commented on the supply chain issues from the last couple of years are resolved. So curious if you are seeing some nice benefits emerge from production planning and if that drive some natural margin and productivity tailwinds that we should see in the margins in 2024?
Neil Hunn: Well, I think scaling certainly helps. We've added a fair amount of capacity at Neptune. We've added supplier capacity at Verathon. We've added supplier capacity at the rf IDEAS -- the RF products businesses. And certainly were not the similar for most companies. The supply chain operations teams are going from a -- from a model that was focused in the last three or four years on resiliency to maybe a more balanced between resiliency and sort of just-in-time, which certainly will help with inventory turns and asset velocity. So we do think there's a little bit of money trapped in inventory for us, so will be more of working capital advantage if we can execute on that plan. In terms of margins, I'll look to Jason. I think it's probably more just scaling infrastructure. I mean, what we -- our cost of goods is so low relative to industrial type companies that the input cost are a fraction of the cost structure of our Enterprise, but your thoughts about that?
Jason Conley: Yes, no, I think we'll have leverage that, that will be a little bit above what the EBITDA margin is for the business. I mean, you do have some of the growth that we're seeing is in single-use products, which are great because they have a lot of recurring revenue -- reoccurring revenue. But they come at a little bit of a lower margin. And then when Neptune grows, it has a little bit of impact to the segment too. So, I would expect leverage to be consistent with what we've seen in the last couple of years just based on those factors.
Christopher Glynn: Great, thanks. And then about the aspiration to 8% to 9% organic growth and driving things higher, certainly understand you have a lot of coordination of experts and best practices across the enterprise. What would you characterize this top of the list businesses with particular action plan opportunities in that respect?
Neil Hunn: So, we appreciate the question, right? So we started this portfolio of 5% to 6% growth. We're in a point of, we think 7% to 7.5% on the way to 8% to 9%. So we've made a fair amount of progress over the last four or five years. It's less about which company. It's more about the process and discipline across all 27, now going into 28 companies. And you've heard us talk about this on repeat in the past, but it's just if anything were consistent. So it's about how do each of our businesses design a strategy in terms of where to play and how to win, and where they have the right to win for durable long-term growth. The second thing is, then how do you process enables the execution of that strategy so that you're on repeat. We can use our long-term forever ownership period as a long-term competitive advantage. So as we stack capabilities that become enduring, then we can outpace our competitors. And then third, is how do we run a talent offense, where we use talent as a long-term competitive advantage. We've talked a lot about the upgrade at the field leadership level over the last three or four years. The expectation for performance is much higher, much, much higher. The alignment of our compensation is tighter to that expectation. And so it's all three acting in unison, that you get the Verathon's that a decade ago were low-single digit growers and now hopefully low double-digit growers. You take businesses like Deltek, they have the mid and they come solidly mid-plus or maybe they can inch in the high singles over time. So it's about every business doing a little bit better on a sustainable basis.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks, Neil.
Neil Hunn: You bet.
Operator: And our next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Hi guys, good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Joe Giordano: Hi, like, on DAT, obviously the free market is weak. Can you just -- I know we've talked about that relationship Kind of being somewhat inverse in weak markets where they actually tend to do better. Is that -- like just to put a finer point on that. Is that more like on negative inflections in the market where it kind of spikes and then if it's like prolong weakness, that it ultimately is forced to like trickle into DAT? is that how we should really think about that?
Neil Hunn: So DAT dynamics are a little bit different than what you described. DAT is when the freight markets are very strong, DAT grows in-line or maybe ahead of that strength. When the freight markets are weaker, they tend to slow down and then they sort of -- so therefore if you looked at their growth, it's more like stairstep type growth in this particular case, because we're coming off such a search for a couple of three years, it's a little bit more exaggerated. The dynamic that you're describing perfectly describes our ConstructConnect business, which is the construction analytics business, where -- when you think about building product manufacturers and contractors and subcontractors, subscribed or content about what commercial real estate buildings are in the process of being planned and built, they want to look for where their next jobs are going to come from. So in the construction markets, real estate markets are white hot and contractors are fully subscribed years out. You the value of our information is less when the market slows and their backlog is standing, then the value of what we offer is much higher. So we tend to have a little bit of a countercyclical sort of demand driver inside the ConstructConnect. We go by the way, Matt and his team for their ConstructConnect are working to balance out and have done a good job. So hopefully the go-forward will be up in up that markets and up-and-down markets. But that's the -- that's what our product strategy is trying to execute.
Joe Giordano: That's good color. Just a -- like a broader question. Obviously, we're getting like more-and-more layoff announcements, like I guess that companies across the spectrum from tech to UPS. So how are you guys, like in your discussions with your customers. And what's the most recent kind of read they're having on where head count stands and what the implications are for your businesses there that somewhat dependent on that?
Neil Hunn: I think unfortunately our read across the macro market is in a great win, right, because we operate at these relatively insulated end-markets, government contractors, property and casualty insurance, or brokerages where employment is higher, life insurance where employment is higher, healthcare where employment is higher, education where employment seems stable if not higher, right? We're in the sort of relatively isolated protected end-markets where the macro swings aren't -- don't impact that much. It doesn't have that much impact on the way we drive compliance bookings across our portfolio. I will say for labor market generally loosening up. It's been advantageous for us. We're also been able to not just fully staff at our business level, but use this opportunity to last probably 12 months plus to significantly upgrade talent across the organization.
Joe Giordano: Fair enough. Thanks, guys
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist. Please go ahead
Terry Tillman: Yes. Can you all hear me okay?
Neil Hunn: Hi, Terry. Good morning
Terry Tillman: Hi, good morning, everyone, and thanks for fitting me in as well. Maybe just one question for you. I guess it's for you, Neil, is what we've seen with our vertical SaaS companies and even horizontal SaaS companies in the past, when they get those customers on the new modern architecture, it really can start to reduce the friction to buy those other add-on modules. And so what I'm curious about is, you just called out some of your businesses in the past like Deltek that have seen improving growth. Anything you can share around net revenue retention from those customers that move to cloud? And I know it's still early days, but is there a propensity to buy those add-on modules? Does it speed up? Does it quick in? And that's just one of these things that could be a cumulative benefit over time, and also help on that organic growth. And then I had a follow-up
Neil Hunn: Super. Appreciate that question. The short answer is categorically yes. And we see that -- first when you when you do the lift and shift from a legacy product to the current cloud-delivered product, there is a -- there is migratory benefits as we talked about Strata as a good example. Same-store sales, 2 to 2.5 times uplift. But then while they're doing that, the checkbooks open and they buy more modules at that moment where total ARR goes up over 3 times and they lift and shift their customer base. Same can be said, saw a different metrics, Aderant, Vertafore, etc. And so, what you're talking about is one of the principal benefits both to the customer and to us, our companies for delivering cloud-delivered, SaaS deliver software, which is being able to be on the most recent release. So, be able to take advantage of all the R&D innovation and more easily be able to take additional products because the delivery mechanism is faster and the implementations are more smooth. So you're exactly right , we're seeing it across the portfolio and expect to see a lot more of that in the years to come.
Terry Tillman: That's great. I appreciate that. And I guess just a follow-up question. And I know you want to be careful and not revealing too much. But if the M&A environment does start opening up more and there's more shots on goal and just more things that are interesting, albeit, taking into account your discipline, I'm curious just bigger-picture, usually it's vertical SaaS, but what about interesting niche horizontal SaaS solutions? Whether it's back-office or kind of middle office or front office and/or second secondarily the idea of maybe software companies with a meaningful payments business. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: So, as we always said we're going to be business model pickers. The reason, historically we've been attracted to vertical, small market verticalized software businesses is because the basis of competition needs to be able to be understood and observed. We want to be able to compete based on both the value proposition of the product but also the intimacy with the customer and the customer relationship. The vast majority of our companies. Their customers want us to win, right, that we are so integral to what they do, they want us to win there always giving us input and feedback about how to be better how to deliver more value to them. And so it's those dynamics that we look for. There were certainly some nichey horizontal type things that meet those criteria, but not a lot. Right. A lot of the horizontal have gigantic TAM to compete on the base of an algorithm. There's very little loyalty to the company. So those types of things will never invested in. Relative to your comment about. Payments business models are we have a variety of business models, software, there's on-prem their SaaS. We just bought a business that is the integration of SaaS, software and payments. Where you have deep embedded integration with what the company does and products do with the payment stream. And so it's a business model , we're open-minded to the business model construct as long as there is immense amount of durability embedded in the business model.
Terry Tillman: Thank you. And our next question comes from Alexander Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please go-ahead. Good morning, thanks. May I have some questions on. Broker. And. The first one is
Operator: And our next question comes from Alexander Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please go ahead
Alexander Blanton: Good morning, thanks. May I have some questions on. Broker. And. The first one is. You've indicated that is not accretive to. Adjusted EPS. Well, this year. Yes, and if not, then there is some dilution. How much is that you might have mentioned that earlier, I might not have caught it
Jason Conley: Yes, hi, Alex, it's Jason. So we assume around 75 million of EBITDA. And then the interest is going to be. 1.6 billion at, Call-IT, 6%, which is our revolver, our current revolver rate. And so that's how you get to your calendar dilution number. What is that number in EPS. $0.10 to $0.15
Alexander Blanton: Okay. So that accounts. For the shortfall. And. In the. Guidance versus consensus tender. Did you say $0.10 to $0.15. Per diluted, okay. Now going-forward, if you're. Growing at double-digits. Mid-teens. That implies you're going to get some pretty. Good. Accretion. In 2025, correct
Jason Conley: Absolutely, yes. We're looking for. Is it the accretion after 24 and it will come to like said it's grown mid-teens. Very good cash conversion dynamics. Have a little bit of a tax benefit this year and next year. And couple of years out after that. So, feeling good about. Contribution to our, to our growth going-forward
Alexander Blanton: Now can you give us an idea of what. The total available market is in their business. And I assume it's all domestic. At this point. And how do they look compared with that. In other words, what's your market-share or approximate. I mean I just. I understand that the leading provider, but it looks like it might be a fragmented market
Jason Conley: So the TAM today is about $750 million. It's growing about 10% a year. Yes. So you can do the math on what we said that's in the next 12 months-to March 25, it's 260, so you've got to grow the market at 10%, do the math. On their current market-share and their relative market-share position. So, their size relative to their next largest competitor is about 1.5 times. The market we would characterize as having a number of legacy technology players and pro care and the principal competitor are generally re-platforming. The market from a technology perspective
Alexander Blanton: Okay. Finally. In that market. There are different sizes to the. The. Groups that you might be. Serving there are nursery schools, for example, that have several 100. Students. And there are small ones that are much smaller. Where do you fit-in that. Do you are you aiming at the. Or serving the smallest schools as a larger ones or both
Neil Hunn: Really appreciate the opportunity to address this question, because one of the aspects of the business that we like quite a bit. So. The way that we segment the market are basically, enterprise, mid and single operators. So 10-plus centers, one to 10 centers and a single operator center. Pro is the demonstrable leader relative market-share advantaged substantially higher than the 1.5 times at both the enterprise and the mid. And the growth rates and the enterprise and the mid is actually growing faster than the overall market. So the markets the segments where broker also is highly compete very well in the single operator. I don't want to. Comment on that. They compete very effectively there as well. But the strongest and have the largest market-share in the enterprise and mid, which means that as the market consolidates ever so slowly over-time that accretes to our advantage
Alexander Blanton: Okay. And finally, is there any foreign business there available, or are you looking to get into that or not
Neil Hunn: Yes. International is not a meaningful part of the business today. It is certainly something that we will consider in the long-term strategic outlook for the business, but not something and probably the near-term because there's so much opportunity domestically to get after.
Alexander Blanton: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
Neil Hunn: I appreciate the questions and have a great one.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks
Zack Moxcey: Thank you everyone for joining us this morning. We look-forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded, and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-25 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the third quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you please turn to page two. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to page three. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, the financial impacts associated with our minority investment in Indicor, transaction and restructuring-related expenses associated with our completed acquisitions, and lastly, a gain from the sale of non-operating assets. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now if you please turn to page four, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our third quarter results with you this morning, which like each of the first two quarters this year were quite good. As we turn to page four, let's look at today's agenda. As usual, we'll start with the most recent quarter's financial highlights then Jason will discuss our results. After that, we'll turn to our segment specific discussion and wrap up outlining our increased 2023 enterprise guidance. Let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to page five, the four main takeaways for today's call are first, we continue to perform at a high level operationally, delivering another quarter of very strong financial results, definitively demonstrating the quality of our portfolio of businesses, our leaders and our governance system; second, we continue to be very active on the M&A front, deploying about $2 billion over last quarter; third, we're increasing our full year guidance; and fourth, we remain very well positioned for further disciplined capital deployment. As it relates to the first takeaway, our continued strong performance, we saw total revenue growth 16% and organic revenue growth 6%. Consistent with our long-standing strategy, we continue to not only scale our enterprise, but also simultaneously improve as underlying quality and recurring revenue base with organic software recurring revenue growing high single-digits in the quarter. Importantly, the cash. As we've been highlighting throughout the year, we had very strong cash flow performance with free cash flow growing 19% for the most recent TTM period and 77% in the quarter. Turning to our second main takeaway, the deployment of $2 billion over last quarter was led by our acquisitions of Syntellis and Replicon, both of which are bolt-ons for Strata and Deltek, respectively. These are each strategically interesting bolt-ons and are highly compelling from a value creation perspective as we're able to buy these businesses for about 14 times next year's EBITDA. More on these in a bit. In addition, in the quarter, we made a $125 million minority investment in Certinia, a professional services automation software business. We're excited to partner with Haveli and General Atlantic Ventures to deploy the value creation thesis associated with this unique opportunity. Third, we're increasing our full year total revenue growth to be 14% plus, increasing our organic revenue growth to be 7% plus and increasing our full year debt guidance to be in the range of $16.62 to $16.66 or up $0.21 at the midpoint versus our previous guidance of $16.36 to $16.50. And fourth, we continue to be very well positioned for further capital deployment by having over $4 billion of M&A firepower. We remain very active in the market as we evaluate and diligence in many attractive opportunities. So with that, Jason, let me turn the call over to you, so you can walk through our third quarter results and our very strong financial position. Jason?
Jason Conley: Thanks, Neil, and good morning to those that have joined our call, and thank you for your interest in Roper. Turning to slide six, I'll take you through our third quarter enterprise results in a bit more detail. Revenue of $1.56 billion was 16% over prior year, with 6% organic growth and a 9% contribution from acquisitions, led by Frontline. As Neil mentioned, organic software recurring revenue growth was in the high single-digit area. This was led by strength in customer expansion and net new logos across our enterprise software businesses. Additionally, our product businesses continued to deliver with 10% organic growth in the quarter, highlighted by Neptune and Verathon. Revenue converted nicely through EBITDA, with EBITDA of $652 million or 18% over prior year. Margin expanded in the quarter to 41.7%, with EBITDA operating leverage of 46%. This all translated to depths of $4.32 versus our guidance of $4.16 to $4.20. Of note, our recent acquisitions had minimal impact on earnings this quarter. We expect DEPS accretion from these deals in 2024 as we pay down the revolver and benefit from full synergy realization. Free cash flow was very strong in the quarter and came in line with our expectations. We generated $625 million of free cash flow, which is up $272 million over prior year. As a reminder, our Frontline business delivers most of its free cash flow in the third quarter. So that, plus a terrific organic contribution drove the significant growth. Looking at cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, as shown on the slide, provides a more relevant comparison. With the frontline renewals tucked into the third quarter, our TTM free cash flow was $1.82 billion, which is up 19% over the prior TTM period. With the expectation for a strong Q4, we're on track to deliver north of 30% free cash flow margins in 2023. Taking a broader view, our TTM free cash flow has compounded 16% over a three-year period, which is in line with EBITDA growth. In summary, our focus on compounding cash flow is evident in our results and will continue to guide us into the future. Next slide on page seven here. Taking a look at our financial position, we ended the quarter with net debt of $6.6 billion, including about $900 million drawn on our revolver. With trailing EBITDA of over $2.4 billion, this leaves us with net leverage of about 2.7 times. Looking forward, we have capacity to deploy $4 billion or more over the foreseeable period even after deploying $2 billion in the third quarter. As always, cash flow growth optimization guides our strategic choices. So while our balance sheet may be primed, we will be disciplined and patient when it comes to capital deployment. To that end, private markets are slowly falling with activity picking up over the last quarter. With that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to go through the segment results and outlook. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Jason. Let's turn to page nine. And before we walk through our segment details, we'd like to start with an overview of our acquisition of Syntellis and the combination with our Strata business. To remind everyone, Strata has been part of Roper for eight years as a leader in delivering SaaS-based financial planning, decision support and performance analytics solutions to US hospitals and health systems. Syntellis is a leading provider of SaaS-based enterprise performance management and data solutions to hospitals, higher education and financial institutions. As many of you know, US-based hospitals and health systems continue to face intense pressure from macro market trends, challenges resulting from care setting shifts, reimbursement rates, lagging rising costs and labor staffing issues. The combined Strata and Syntellis business will uniquely be able to help health systems address these difficult financial and operational challenges. Together, the enterprise has relationships with about 70% of the country's health systems. Stand-alone, Syntellis meets all our acquisition criteria, a leader in a niche market, delivers mission-critical application-specific solutions, is an HSD organic growth business and operates an extremely asset-light business model. Taken together with Strata, it only gets more attractive in terms of the combined customer base, the combined product offering, the combined financial profile and the combined future product development opportunities. For 2024, we expect Syntellis to deliver about $185 million of revenue and about $90 million of EBITDA inclusive of cost synergies. Of note, this EBITDA is $5 million higher than at the time of our deal announcement. Considering the $1.25 billion net purchase price, the valuation is about 14 times next year's EBITDA and will only improve from there. Operationally, the teams have moved quite expeditiously and are ahead of schedule relative to the near-term value creation plan, having implemented about 85% of the cost synergy opportunities within the first 45 days. In addition, the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Finally, the new combined leadership team headed by Strata's CEO, John Martino, are turning their strategic attention to new combined product development ideas. Net-net, this is a highly compelling value creation opportunity for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, let's now turn to page 10 and walk through our Application Software segment. Third quarter revenues for Application Software segment were $803 million, up 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins increased to 44.6% in the quarter. We'll start with Deltek. Deltek was solid in the quarter with sustained momentum in their SMB channel and the private sector solutions. They continue to see sluggish activity in their GovCon Enterprise segment given the backdrop of federal government spending uncertainty. Retention rates across the entirety of Deltek remain high. Importantly, over the last couple of months, Deltek released a Gen AI-enabled data collection capability for the GovWin IQ business, an LLM based processing features for their Vantagepoint product. It's good to see further adoption of Gen AI within the portfolio. Also in the quarter, as we outlined on last quarter's call, Deltek closed the acquisition of Replicon, albeit about a month later than anticipated. To remind you, Replicon is a market-leading timekeeping and workforce management SaaS solution focused on professional services firms and is highly complementary to Deltek's strategy. We continue to expect Replicon to contribute north of $70 million of revenue and $24 million of EBITDA next year. Aderant, our software business focused on the needs of law firms, continues to excel and deliver a very strong quarter. In the quarter, Aderant saw record third quarter bookings and continued success in the adoption and cross-sell of their SaaS solutions. Also and importantly, during the quarter, Aderant continue to mature and gain market traction with their Generative AI-enabler MADDI. Aderant's most recent Gen AI product release enables passive fee earner time entry assistance through Aderant's iTimekeep product line. Great to see this rapid product innovation at Aderant. Vertafore, our software business that tech enables property and casualty insurance agencies continues to be a great business for us with solid performance across our core P&C business and their recent MGA solutions bolt-on. Strata, independent from the Syntellis acquisition was strong in the quarter and continued to gain market adoption of their leading decision support and financial planning solutions. Finally, Frontline had strong customer renewal season and delivered significant cash flow, as Jason mentioned, to the enterprise in the quarter. Looking to the final quarter of the year, we expect to see organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digit area for the segment. Turning to page 11. Third quarter revenues for our Network Software segment were $364 million, up 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 56.3%. Let's start with our US and Canadian freight matching businesses DAT and Loadlink, both of which grew in the quarter despite the continued challenges across the broader freight and logistics markets. Over the last quarter or two, these businesses have done a fantastic job of baselining their cost structures while continuing to invest in new product development. This led to strong segment margins in the quarter. Relative to product development, and as we highlighted a touch last quarter, DAT launched Gen AI-enabled solutions, among other initiatives targeted to combat freight industry fraud, which is a problem that plagues the entire industry. Within the first month of release, DAT has made a significant dent in fraudulent activity and DAT's customers have noticed and recognized this great accomplishment. This is a shiny example of why and how Roper businesses continue to innovate through and across macroeconomic cycles, which enables us to consistently deliver on market and customer opportunities ultimately leading to market share gains. Turning to our iPipeline. Our network software business that tech enabled the distribution channel for life insurance and annuities. iPipeline continues to execute at a high level and gain market share. In the quarter, they had very nice ARR gains driven by strong retention and customer expansion activity. This growth is directly attributable to iPipeline's strategy that is laser-focused on their core life insurance and annuity customer base. We talked about this concept during our Investor Day earlier in the year. A closely held value of Roper in our businesses is a notion that we compete and win based on customer intimacy. Customer intimacy requires focus and strategic choice. iPipeline over the last two to three years has excelled at this, the concept of focus on the core and choice, which enables further market share gains. Great job, team. Foundry, our media and entertainment postproduction software business continued their business model transition to a subscription model and is ahead of plan in that regard. Though industry demand was temporarily paused given both the Hollywood writers and actor strikes. Notwithstanding, Foundry continues to innovate their product offering and will aggressively compete for customer wallet share in the coming months as the actor Strike results. Finally, our alternate site healthcare businesses, MHA, SoftWriters and SHP were strong in the quarter. Execution was solid and the business has benefited by having improved census and skilled nursing assisted living facilities and home health reaching the highest occupancy levels and patient volumes since the onset of the pandemic. For the final quarter of the year, we expect to see low single-digit growth for this segment based on continued challenging freight market conditions and the actor strike impact on foundry. Now let's turn to page 12 and walk through our TEP segment. Revenues in the quarter were $396 million, up 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for the segment were strong at 36.5% in the quarter. We'll start with Neptune, our water meter and technology business. Neptune delivered another fantastic quarter of operational and financial performance. As has been the case for several quarters, Neptune continues to see strong demand and momentum for the residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters and increasing adoption for their meter data management software. We remain bullish about Neptune and the market in which they compete, given this market tends to be quite steady as Neptune's customers' budgets are typically fixed year-to-year and not tied to broader macroeconomic trends or cycles. Verathon was awesome in the quarter as well with double-digit order growth and tremendous operational execution. Specifically, Verathon saw strength across the reoccurring single-use products both Bronchoscope or Bflex and video innovation or GlideScope as well as BladderScan capital purchases. A group of smaller businesses here Inovonics, IPA and rf IDEAS were fantastic as they were last quarter substantially working through a series of nagging supply chain challenges. Relative to the final quarter of the year, we expect to see low double-digit organic growth for this segment. Now please turn to page 14, and let's go through our increased 2023 guidance. Based on our strong third quarter performance, we're raising our full year 2023 guidance for total revenue, organic revenue and adjusted debts. For 2023, we now expect total revenue growth to be 14% plus, an increase from about 13% last quarter. In addition, we're raising our full year organic revenue outlook to be in a 7% plus ZIP code an increase from about 7% last quarter and 5% to 6% in our original guide for the year. As a result of our improved revenue outlook, we're increasing our DEPS guidance for the year to be in the range of $16.62 and $16.66 up from our prior guidance of $16.36 to $16.50. Assumed in this guidance is the tax rate trending to the high end of our 21% to 22% range. For the fourth quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $4.28 and $4.32. Now please turn over to page 15 and then we'll look forward to answering your questions. We want to leave you with the same four points with which we started. First, we delivered yet another solid quarter. In the third quarter, revenues increased 16% to $1.56 billion. This growth was underpinned with 6% organic revenue growth and high single-digit organic software recurring revenue growth. In addition, EBITDA margins were notably strong at 41.7% and cash flow was outstanding, growing 77% in the quarter and 19% on a TTM basis. Second, we successfully deployed $2 billion of capital in the quarter, led by the bolt-ons of Syntellis and Replicon. These two deals will deliver about $115 million of EBITDA next year and are priced about 14 times next year's EBITDA, quite compelling. Third, based on the strong quarter performance, the recurring nature of our revenue stream and the importance of our solutions to our customers were increasing our full year total and organic revenue growth outlook and increasing our full year DEPS outlook to be between $16.62 and $16.66. And finally, notwithstanding this quarter's $2 billion of deployment, we continue to be active with our capital deployment activities as we have north of $4 billion of available M&A firepower. As we've been discussing over the past several quarters, we have a very large pipeline of opportunities, though, as always, we remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure the continued optimal deployment of our available capital, just as we did with the Syntellis and Replicon acquisitions. We firmly believe that patients as is always the case with capital deployment will be rewarded. Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to share an exciting addition to the Roper executive team. During the quarter, Janet Glazer joined our team and is leading our acquisition cultivation and corporate development outreach efforts. Janet will partner with our M&A resources, our corporate leadership team and several of our business units to increase our forward-leaning posture with private equity sponsors and their businesses. Most recently, Janet was a global sector leader and portfolio manager at Fidelity. We're super excited that Janet has joined our leadership team and welcome aboard. As we turn to your questions, and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel. We'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy, yet we close our businesses on how to structurally improve their growth rates and underlying business quality. Finally, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focus on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow in the mid-teens area over a long arc of time. So with that, thank you for your continued interest in Roper and let's open it up to your questions.
Operator: We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Julian Mitchell: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to focus on the network software business for a second. One question really trying to put a finer point on how much of a headwind in that Q4 sales guide you have from the freight markets what sort of pace of decline or softness there? And is foundry more of a sort of rear-view month of October type headwind? And then was there anything onetime in the network software margins in Q3 that made them so high?
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Julian. Thanks for the question. So I'll try and take it in reverse order. The margins I tried to cover in my prepared remarks how DAT and Loadlink have just done a great job in Q2 and Q3, aligning the cost structure of where the business is today. And so they're actually a little bit ahead of where they wanted to be in that regard. So that's what drove the margins. Relative to Foundry, it's very much in Q4. I mean, there's still much -- very much is an actor strike for Foundry in post-production. They need content flowing through the pipeline. And right now, writers are writing, but actors aren't acting. The general consensus that will sort of resolve itself in Q4, but one never knows. Then the pipelines will build and sort of leading into maybe the second half of Q1 and Q2, Foundry's demand will sort of get back to normal levels. So it's sort of as a Q3, Q4, maybe Q1 impacting. Relative to DAT and Loadlink, I'll remind just DAT has just been remarkable over the last couple of years. It's really been abnormal growth. It's been exceptional. DAT has a super long history of being very steady and growing. They grew in the quarter. They continued to innovate, you know, in October here. We've seen sort of we're bouncing along the bottom, if you will, maybe a slight uptick in the first handful of weeks in October. Who knows if that sort of started the trend or just some of the yellow sort of, you know, capacity coming into a different part of the market and reshaping. But we expect normal behavior for DAT. It's just we've got to wait about get off the bottom here in terms of the industry freight volumes. Anything you want to add to that, Jason?
Jason Conley: No, I think that's right. I mean, the abnormality, if you do a straight line from 2019, you'd see the business has been up substantially, right? So we have sort of this exceptional growth. A lot of carriers come in the market, they're exiting out. And you know, again, it's just been a good steady growth for us over the last 20 years absent, you know, sort of this exceptional period. And just back on Foundry, I would say that what we've observed is the gross retention of the business has been extremely strong. We have moved to a subscription model this year, and so that gives customers pause on if they get off maintenance, they're going to have to come back on a subscription. So we feel good to once the actor strike is done, that's -- that business is going to pick back up next year, hopefully.
Julian Mitchell: Thanks very much. And then just a quick follow-up. It sounds like Syntellis off to a strong start. But maybe my question on Certinia more, you know, maybe a slightly unusual structure for Roper to go into this minority interest approach, you know, given the attributes when you bring something in-house. So maybe just sort of explain why you went for this structure. And any sense of the scale of Certinia or the size of that business?
Neil Hunn: Yeah. So we're partners with Haveli principally in -- the Haveli partners, we know quite well. It was one of the founders of Vista and then the person who led the tech practice at Bain came together joined Haveli. So the long history of both of them as individuals. They actually approached us to see if we can lend some of our expertise to the situation. So we're intrigued by being able to help. We're intrigued by the value creation opportunity here. It's a very compelling value-creation opportunity. And then we'll also learn a thing or two along the way. I mean, this is a smart group of people that have a long history of doing this type of transaction. It's a unique opportunity, Julian, as you mentioned. We're not looking to do a lot more of things like this. This is not the beginning of like a large book of minority investments. We'll continue to be opportunistic, but it's not going to be anything. It's going to be few and far between in terms of our pacing and volume on this. And the scale, I think we're on at the private business, so we'll sort of keep the scale of the business sort of in the private domain.
Julian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Allison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Jason Conley: Good morning.
Allison Poliniak: Going back to the technology-enabled products, it seems like certainly a tick-up in terms of where you were expecting the second half of this year. I know you mentioned Neptune and Verathon. But any specific vertical driving sort of that outperformance in the sector, in the space?
Jason Conley: I think sort of market-based.
Neil Hunn: Oh, sorry, but you broke up just on the very end there, Allison. So I would say -- so yeah, just to reiterate it, sort of Neptune is, I mean, it is a bit market-based in that, that market continues to be, you know, very healthy. The customers are -- ordering patterns are consistent and robust, lots of backlog carrying into next year. So there's market share gains and product advantage we have and also a cooperative market for sure. You know, with Verathon, the market dynamic is moving towards single-use in the category in bronchoscope from reusables because of infection control. So it's a market that is definitely a growth market that we are very soon to be the number one player in knock on wood, maybe this quarter. And so, that's market related, but just tremendous execution by the team, both go-to-market and product. I mean, tons of product vitality. And then also in the segment, we have a couple -- we mentioned a couple of smaller RF product businesses. That's less market and more just clearing through just a mountain of supply chain problems that plague the businesses for many -- a few quarters. And second quarter and third quarter are great in that regard to those businesses.
Allison Poliniak: Understood. And then just turning to M&A. You mentioned sort of those private markets starting to fall. Can you maybe -- you know, talk through sort of the multiples that you're starting to see there? Are they as attractive as what we've just seen this past quarter? Or do they still need to come in a little bit here? Thanks.
Neil Hunn: Yeah, that's really the question. The -- so this -- it's like a -- the market Jason sort of referred to it as like a coiled spring. I mean, there is a tremendous amount of activity like forming activity, investment bankers, pipelines are filling processes are starting. There's increasing pressure from the LPs onto the sponsors to start thinking about getting some liquidity back to them. The sponsor is starting to think about raising new funds, which they need liquidity to do that. So there's a lot of the precursor activity that is required to see transactions come back into the market. The question still remains about the bid-ask spread between buyers and sellers. Here still -- the number of printed deals to date is still small, right? So this is -- and we anticipate -- well, we know there's going to be more opportunities. We don't yet know where they're going to clear. We continue to be super patient. You know, the market is coming to us. We don't have to chase the market. If we can find very compelling value opportunities like Replicon and Syntellis will do them. If we don't, we'll remain patient.
Allison Poliniak: Understood. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Jason Conley: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Hey, first, congrats on hiring Janet. I've known her many years. I think she'll be a great addition to the team. So congrats.
Neil Hunn: Thanks for saying that. We're looking at her, she's sort of an -- she's not on the back script, we're looking at her, and she's a blushing. So she's got to be great as part of the team for sure.
Deane Dray: That's fabulous. All right. So, first, I wanted to go back more of a macro question. Had there been any changes at the margin and customer decision-making? You know, the pace of new logos, you called out Deltek, which is understandable given their government service side, some of the uncertainties there, but just kind of broad-brush, are you seeing any changes in customer behavior?
Neil Hunn: So it's played out as we anticipated over the course of the year. It's really been a mixed bag. Just look at one company in Deltek, strong across SMB, both on the government contracting and private sector, professional services markets, strong at the enterprise level for PS, less strong on the government contracting side at the enterprise level. So it really is a mixed bag. In that case, it's less macro related and more tied to the uncertainty around what's happening to the federal government and budgets and what's going on there. You see strength across iPipeline. You see strength at Aderant. Those are very healthy customer bases. So it really is a mixed bag. Obviously, the weakness at DAT given that we just talked about with just where freight markets are, so it's really a collection of bespoke things than it is sort of a broad brush macro across the portfolio.
Deane Dray: All right. That's good to hear. And then second question on maybe more of an update on Gen AI. It was interesting that you called out several initiatives at the companies are pursuing DAT and Aderant. Are these mostly bottom-up initiatives by the companies? Or is there anything from the headquarter side, maybe you're getting some expertise to help identify opportunities? And you know maybe give us a sense of how penetrated it is today within Roper and what kind of adoption might you see a year from now just to kind of -- it sounds like you're playing more offense here in this and would love some insights. Thanks.
Neil Hunn: Sure. Yeah. So we're definitely playing offense here. We think this is a transformational technology, right? It's not a trendy paradigm or hyping a fab. We think this is a foundational technology that will change the way we all live our personal lives and this will be conducted over the course of the next five years to 10 years, right? So that's our view on the technology of Gen AI and large language models, et cetera. So what we're doing is really a combination of top-down bottoms-up, if you will. From a top-down perspective, Deane, we've organized -- we deputized, I should say, a couple of our group executives, Satish Maripuri and Mike Corkery, to lead an education series across a variety of topics around Gen AI for our companies. So we've done a series of Zoom meetings, you know, three or four. We've got five or six still to go. They're spaced out every three weeks or four weeks around, that started with what is Gen AI, and it's evolving more and more into how do you deploy methods of deployment, where and how in the organization you deploy it both in productivity and new product ideas. So the hope with that is that it's -- it spurns this creative thinking across the 18,000 people at Roper. Think about how to impact our customers positively, how to impact our operations positively. So ultimately, it will be a bottoms-up, groundswell of ideas, but we're accelerating the learning, if you will. Ultimately, we might do a couple other things that center around, you know, contracts with some of the larger players or deployment models for cybersecurity, and safety and security purposes. But as with Roper, all the good ideas will be generated bottoms-up from the field and the leadership team and the employee base.
Deane Dray: Great to hear. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: Welcome.
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please go ahead.
Joe Vruwink: Great. Thank you. In the slides, you make the distinction that organic software growth, the recurring software growth that's already in the high single-digits. And then, of course, your reported organic is 5%. I guess the question is that generally going to be the spread you would expect just given professional services and probably license attrition over time? And then is that spread expected to be consistent in the foreseeable future?
Jason Conley: Hey, Joe, it's Jason. I would say that -- there always will be a spread. It was probably a little bit more pronounced this quarter just because we had some deals in AS push out, and we have -- you know, we talked about Foundry going from, you know, perpetual to subscription. So yeah, there always will be a spread. It's -- like I said, it's probably a little bit more pronounced than the third quarter though.
Joe Vruwink: Okay, thanks for that. And then I wanted to go back a couple of quarters ago now you mentioned that AS had ramping services capacity that was to support strong bookings in your health care assets. I'm wondering if you can maybe just provide an update on maybe whether those awards have gone live. And then in the broader healthcare apparatus, you know, what are you seeing there? Obviously, you're increasing exposure there now via M&A I guess, how does maybe organic growth as a profile stand relative to the AS broader segment?
Neil Hunn: Yeah. So relative to the professional services ramp build, that was principally at our laboratory -- global laboratory business, Clinisys. They've done just a tremendous job competing and winning in the UK, in the French market, in the Benelux region, they tend to be larger installs, and they did a nice job there. It also is around power plan, were that -- I think their second quarter services bookings was the largest services bookings quarter in the company's history, if my memory serves me correctly. So the deals have sort of formed in the capacity is in the process being utilized. So good operational sort of foresight from those two businesses. And then relative to health care exposure, I mean, it's with Syntellis. I mean, it's a stand-alone high single-digit growth business. Our Strata business was a little bit better than that over our ownership period. And the companies -- the combined company, now they've got the most of the cost synergy work is super excited about the new product development ideas they have to further monetize both the customer base and persona. I mean, we have 70% of the health systems as customers with the persona of the CFO, which is -- it's not just the same customer, but the same persona between the two companies, and we're very excited about what that can do.
Joe Vruwink: That's, great. Thank you very much.
Neil Hunn: You're welcome.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Davis: Good morning, everybody.
Neil Hunn: Hey, Scott. Good morning.
Scott Davis: Yeah. Good morning. Guys, when you compete -- when you're doing a more bolt-on-ish deal in this kind of rate environment, are you competing against a different type of competitor in these things versus maybe a year or two ago? Sort of less PE shop showing up? And you're just kind of trying to get a sense of sort of just less competition overall for those types of transactions.
Neil Hunn: So what I would say is -- as a general matter, we're still competing against the sponsor community, though the depth of the field is a little thinner. In the case of Syntellis, it was really a proprietary deal. And we haven't seen many proprietary deals in a long time, right? I mean, in a more frothy market, even if you were the most likely owner of an asset, the seller would run a market check. And in this case, we're able to just sort of cut through all that and reach a deal that made sense to both parties. So maybe in that regard, I mean, the competition is a little thinner, but it's the same set of characters.
Scott Davis: Okay. Make sense. Not much to pick on a very solid quarter overall. But can you give us a sense of materiality of kind of the foundry, you know, just the strike impact and everything? If foundry wasn't in the mix, would growth have been higher than the 5% segment growth?
Jason Conley: Yeah, I'd say a little bit. I mean, it's -- you know, for the second half, it's like single-digit revenue impact relative to our last guide.
Scott Davis: Okay.
Jason Conley: Mid-singles.
Scott Davis: Okay. All right. Good. All right. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Appreciate it.
Neil Hunn: Yeah. Good to hear from you.
Operator: The next question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist. Please go ahead.
Terry Tillman: Yes, thanks for taking my questions, and good morning, gentlemen. The first question is on Frontline. If I'm not mistaken, you know, you have this important renewal season. We saw the strong cash flow in the quarter. I'm curious, those are important kind of milestones when they're renewing and you get the cash flow. But what happens and what did you see with expansion or interest in expanding products or modules, adding more seats, taking pricing? And then the second part of my first question is just how is new business growth going in Frontline?
Neil Hunn: Okay. So Frontline, as we mentioned, I mean, it was just a good first year. The renewals and we're right on plan. Consistent with last year, gross retention was in line with historical and net retention. So relative to the upsell, cross-selling was in line with historical rates, sort of 103, 104 is very consistent in the quarter for Frontline for net retention. So steady as she goes. It just goes to the criticality of what Frontline does for the customers in which they serve. Again, they empower the Frontline of education. So it's good. In terms of the new cross-selling or excuse me, net new customers, it's been very good on the sort of the run rate business at Frontline. Actually a little bit better than prior years. And then as it goes with the lot of small numbers, there's a handful of large deals that Frontline normally gets in any given year. The larger deals have been a little slower to show up this year. They're still in the pipeline. They're just starting to push into the right, but we're talking about three to five deals in the course of a year. It -- it's just a lot of small numbers. So we're not reading too much into that. Hard to recall a macro or a lack of execution. It's just a small number of deals.
Terry Tillman: Okay, thanks for that, Neil. And I guess, just my follow-up is on Neptune. You know, do you foresee this momentum continuing into '24? And how much should we hang our hat on this meter data management product? I mean, does that move to the needle? Does it have a good attach rate? Thanks.
Neil Hunn: Yeah. So Neptune has got a lot of backlog carrying next year. Obviously, we've got to go through our planning process for all of our companies and understand the puts and takes. But we expect Neptune to have another good year as a general matter, just given the momentum in the backlog, the market positioning, the capacity they have, the competitive advantage they have. Relative to master -- data management and the software, it's been an important part of this business, you know, as we have more technology on the meter to get more data off the meters and do and push more capability to the theaters, you have to be able to start process a gigantic volume of data to be able to put it into a billing system or cash collection system. And so we have a pretty decent size and highly capable software group at Neptune that didn't exist 10 years ago that deals with this and it's a growing part of the business. It's always -- it's a smaller part of the business, but it's a fast-growing part of the business. One worthy to call out in the quarter. So I appreciate the question.
Terry Tillman: Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning, all. So a lot has been asked. I was curious about some language in the press release that guidance doesn't include, obviously, future acquisitions or divestitures. You've had a pretty broad stroke of divestiture over a couple of year period recently passed by. So curious if that -- the intent on putting that word in the press release.
Neil Hunn: I think it's just standard language, Christopher. And so nothing to read into that.
Christopher Glynn: Okay, great. Thank you. That's all I got.
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Hey, good morning, guys.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Jason Conley: Good morning.
Joe Giordano: Hey. So on M&A, like if we're going into like kind of a more murky kind of macro environment here, a little bit more uncertain, I get why it would kind of open up those markets a little bit. But do these large like larger-scale bolt-ons become incrementally more attractive to you in -- like times like this just because you kind of know the markets more, you probably have kind of more certainty around an outcome than like, you know, bringing in something that perhaps is an adjacency or something that you're just less familiar with in general?
Neil Hunn: Well, Joe, I would say, yes and no to that. I would -- I mean, first of all, times of uncertainty relative to our capital deployment, our history and pattern recognition says, those are great times for us, right? If you go back to like the pandemic, we do Vertafore. Like in the late summer of 2020, it was an -- it's a terrific business for us, a great asset for us, our largest deal because of our balance sheet strength and our flexibility, we were in business when nobody else was and the sellers need to sell. Frontlines, very different reasons last year, very similar. Syntellis, I mean, it's opportunity in this uncertainty. So we like that. Now as it relates to going to be deployed to a platform or bolt-on, we've built over 20 years, the ability to understand -- be a great, if you will, humbly a business picker. And part of that is understanding the markets and understand the competitive advantages. But in that, we're looking for stability, right? We're looking for stable competitive forces, observable competitive forces, small markets, clear leadership position, high gross and net retention, that's a formula for stability which -- from which to grow from. And so if we see things like that and these uncertain times, we'll certainly lean into that. At the same time, as we talked about at our Investor Day, for our capital deployment strategy, we are trying to lean in to do more bolt-on activity because they've historically been the best value-creative deals we've done, they help our businesses once they turn organic grow faster. That's a gigantic part of what we brought Janet in to do to help lead that part of our investment strategy. And so, we'll do either, but you understand sort of the dynamic between the -- the interplay between the two.
Joe Giordano: Yeah, that makes sense. And then just last, we still don't have a speaker of the house, we may have a government shutdown coming at the end of the year. What are the implications of something like that on Deltek's business?
Neil Hunn: I think all of that is factored into the current environment. I think the large government -- the enterprise class government contractors based on just the uncertainty have -- or just are being very cautious in their activity. They've been cautious over, you know, fits and starts this year. So I think it's baked in. It's certainly reflected in our balance of the outlook for this year, sort of continued uncertainty. And this but the good news is this will eventually clear itself and then the government to get you back to spending, and that will be a catalyst for Deltek.
Joe Giordano: Great, thanks. And I'll just echo Deane's. I'll just echo Deane's comments and great hire on Janet. We'll miss her as a client, but a good home for her and a great hire for you guys. Thanks guys.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Steve Tusa: Hey, good morning.
Neil Hunn: Hey, Steve. Good morning to you.
Steve Tusa: Congrats to Janet as well. Yeah. Can you guys just, obviously, great cash in the quarter, I guess, you know, you guys have talked about the seasonality here. How do we kind of think about the 4Q from a working capital perspective now? Like how should we look at history? And you know is there anything that kind of gives back when it comes to Frontline in the fourth quarter? Like what do -- how do we think about working capital? Should we expect another strong working capital performance similar to what we just saw in the third quarter, like history you know?
Neil Hunn: Yeah. I mean before Frontline, Q4 was our -- you know, our strongest quarter of the year. You know, we have a lot of large renewals at our enterprise software businesses. We expect it to be strong again this year. I mean, I don't think Frontline is going to really give back. They're just not going to give, right? They'll be kind of flattish on cash. So we feel good about sort of the -- you know, the fourth quarter and how it's going to close out the year. We still expect to be north of 30% free cash flow margins for this year. And so, Q3 was obviously strong, and we expect the same in Q4.
Steve Tusa: And anything else year-over-year in Q4 from a cash tax timing perspective or outside of working capital we have to be aware of?
Neil Hunn: Not really. Yeah.
Steve Tusa: Okay. So effectively, net income growth and then some working capital benefits?
Neil Hunn: Right.
Steve Tusa: Okay. Great. And then just following up on the environment and enterprise software. You guys mentioned there's like there's pockets of softening. I think can you just clarify like what you're just seeing broadly there from customers into '24. It just seems like the economy is mixed, but a lot of the software businesses out there holding up really well. How would you guys kind of characterize the environment maybe a little bit deeper there?
Neil Hunn: I mean, I think it's -- again, just to remind everybody, right, I mean we've got a business model that's like built on durability, right? So it's very highly incurring. What we do is mission-critical. So we're not on the fringe, generally speaking, something that can be turned off and on. We're just -- we're system of record. You know, we operate sort of the freight markets like our customers need our software that leads to high retention. There's pricing, that's routine in the growth algorithm. Most of the cyclicality has been taken out of the business. And so this is -- the macro is it's a very durable set of businesses. So we're talking about a point or two here or there relative to the impact of all of this. There isn't -- we talked quite a bit getting rid of this call, Steve, about is there some broad brush pan room for macroeconomic impact. And what we say is what we said from the beginning of the year is we just expected from our January call that software would be a little slower because generally you're not going to buy new large software with uncertainty in the market. So the impact on our growth algorithm is gross retention should is -- we expect that it is a little bit higher. Cross-selling and up-selling should be a little bit lower because you're not going to grow as much with your customers and then we're not so. Our net retention is going to net out to be in the same area code as it always has been. And then you're not going to sell as many large new things and that's essentially what's played out across the enterprise, but there's pockets of differences. You've got a ton of strength at Aderant. You have a little bit of weakness in GovCon at Deltek. You've got strength you know at -- you know and help me with -- iPipeline, sorry, tons of strength in iPipeline, improving strength at ConstructConnect, but then you have the DAT headwind. So it really is a mixed bag of things.
Steve Tusa: Got it. Okay. Great color. Thanks a lot.
Neil Hunn: You're welcome.
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Joe Ritchie: Hey, good morning, guys and congrats to you both, Janet. I look forward to reconnecting sometime in the near future. Just my first question, maybe just talking on the bolt-ons for a second. So clearly highlighted Syntellis and Replicon today. As you look across your portfolio, where do you see the most opportunity to potentially bolt-on?
Neil Hunn: So we're in the early stages of doing that, right? So we don't want what we do not and we will not do is do a center-led process from Sarasota and say to any one of our companies, here's something you should buy. We're not going to do that. We will not do that. What we are going to do is we're asking the vast, vast majority of our businesses as they go through their strategic planning cycle to have both an organic and an inorganic strategy. And so, as we go through that vetting exercise, we'll build -- we'll understand the strategic areas of expansion and then we'll have the discussion should it be organic or inorganic. From there, we'll then forward lean to figure out the inorganic opportunities and then go from there. So that's the process. As a general matter, I think, the larger businesses are the most obvious ones. We'll start Deltek, you know, Frontline, Vertafore, but it's not limited to the largest one. I mean, Strata was sort of an average or a mean-size business for us, if you will, and there was a very compelling opportunity. I think we'll ultimately have, if you will, again, the vast majority, maybe as many as 20 of our 27 companies will have some inorganic growth strategy. Whether or not we execute against that, is a whole another thing, but at least we'll have strategies formed across the vast majority of the portfolio.
Joe Ritchie: Got it. That's helpful, Neil. And I guess maybe just a follow-on question. As you think about renewal rates, you mentioned Frontline. So I think 3Q tends to be more like a -- the typical quarter where you'd see more renewals for Frontline. Across your portfolio, does it tend to be more weighted around like the fourth quarter? Or just any color you can give us on, you know, I guess, the confidence in your retention rate staying very high going into next year?
Neil Hunn: Yeah. Joe, you know, our fourth quarter is a very strong renewal season for us at Deltek, Vertafore, and Aderant. So -- but I'd say, you know, it is balanced across the year, but more in the fourth quarter. And obviously with Frontline in the third quarter, that's changed the dynamic there. But we expect strong renewals. You know, we had our operating calls this quarter and the renewal process has already kicked off for the fourth quarter for these businesses, and you know, we're hearing positive feedback.
Joe Ritchie: Okay, great. Thanks guys.
Neil Hunn: You're welcome.
Operator: The next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Brett Linzey: Hi. Good morning, all. Congrats on a nice quarter.
Neil Hunn: Thank you. Good morning.
Brett Linzey: Hey, just wanted to come back to ConstructConnect. I think in the previous comment you said improving strength. I was just hoping you put a finer point on that improving activity. And just particularly given the -- some of the incoming data on construction is a little bit weaker, higher rates and so on. So I'd just be curious what you're seeing there.
Neil Hunn: Yeah. So just to remind everybody, Construct Connect is the leader in commercial construction informatics. So in this data set is used in the planning stages of construction. So once they shovel goes in the ground, that's a different part of the industry and one in which we do not compete. So it's actually -- when -- so think of it if you're a contractor or a building product manufacturer and there's so much work to do that you have a backlog and you're not responding to RFPs. That's the environment we've been in for the last handful of years. It actually has a dampening demand driver for our business. When business is harder to find, there's fewer projects than the contractors are having to work harder and find opportunities. That plays into the strength of ConstructConnect. So, to the first point why we're seeing some improving strength there is because the market's coming to us, it tends to have countercyclical demand drivers. But we have to -- when we talk about ConstructConnect, we got to talk about the operational improvements that have happened in the business with Matt Strazza and his team at ConstructConnect. They're doing a tremendous job taking complexity out of this business, having a go-to-market motion that's more efficient, having a product motion that's more efficient, having a marketing message that's more efficient. And so when the market's coming to us, we are doing a better job capturing that demand. So, it's a combination of both market and operations.
Brett Linzey: Got it. I appreciate the color. And then just the last question on the margin outlook. Understand you don't want to give full guidance here in October for next year, but just thinking about the moving pieces, you know, the mixed differences in the business, is there a framework to think about in terms of you know percent margin expansion, incremental margins and particularly within network software, I mean, do we build off these high levels for next year?
Neil Hunn: Yeah, I mean, I think it's a little early to talk about margins for next year, but I mean, broadly, you know, 45% operating leverage is sort of what our long-term model is, and we've been you know, close to that this year. I think you're probably right, though on network, it'll be maybe a little bit above that next year, but it's still too early to tell.
Brett Linzey: Got it. I appreciate the color.
Operator: The next question comes from Brad Hewitt with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Brad Hewitt: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Jason Conley: Good morning.
Brad Hewitt: So I noticed that Tim Haddock, your VP of Acquisitions, is on the board of Certinia. Is there anything to read through there in terms of potentially seeing that relationship with Certinia evolve and deepen over time?
Neil Hunn: I wouldn't read too much into that. We have a board member and a board observer, and part of us delivering our knowledge, if you will, to that enterprise and also learning from the enterprise comes partially through the board interaction. And so I would not read anything into that other than Tim was the one who helped shepherd the process. He had the relationships. Obviously, the MA team leads the Diligence. And so he's just a name board member. I wouldn't read anything into that. This is one step into a second-step transaction.
Brad Hewitt: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe switching gears. In terms of free cash flow conversion, you guys have typically targeted conversion of about 80% of EBITDA and historically you've executed on that. But now, following the Indicor sale, just curious if you guys have kind of reassessed that number and whether there's scope to kind of outperform on that from a longer-term perspective.
Neil Hunn: Yeah, I mean, I think I've said for about a year, you know, we kind of looked at things as kind of a margin, so as a percent of revenue. And being north of 30% of revenue on free cash flow is kind of the right way to think about it. You know, with EBITDA, obviously, with interest rates changing, it's -- you know, it's good to look at it in a certain point of time. And over time, that can change. So percent of revenue is sort of how we think about it. North of 30% is our target.
Brad Hewitt: Appreciate it.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zach Moxie for any closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-21 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded and all participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the second quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President, and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we used a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you please turn to page two. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to page three. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and the financial impacts associated with our minority investment in Indicor. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now, if you please turn to page four, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: [Technical Difficulty] and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We’re looking forward to sharing our second quarter results with you this morning, which like Q1 were quite good. As we turn to page four, let's look at today's agenda. I'll start with our second quarter enterprise highlights then ask Jason to share our financial results. After that, we'll turn to our segment specific discussion and wrap up outlining our increased 2023 enterprise guidance. So let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to page five, the four main takeaways for today's call are: first, we continue to perform extremely well and had a very strong second quarter, another demonstration of the quality of our portfolio of businesses. Second, we're increasing our full-year guidance both in terms of total and organic revenue growth and adjusted debts. Third, Generative AI. We're very excited by the promise of this technology and outline reasons why today. And fourth, we remain very well positioned for disciplined capital deployment. As it relates to the first takeaway, a strong start to the year and a solid second quarter, we saw total revenue grow 17% and organic revenue grow 9%. Consistent with our longstanding strategy we continue to not only scale our enterprise, but also simultaneously improve its underlying quality and recurring revenue base. Importantly, we had very strong cash flow performance with free cash flow growing 17% in the quarter. Our results this quarter are another proof point that our higher quality, less cyclical portfolio was purpose built to consistently perform at a very high level. Given the strong second quarter, we're increasing our full-year total revenue growth to be around 13%, increasing our organic revenue growth to be around 7% and increasing our full-year debt guidance to be in the range of $16.36 to $16.50 or up $0.23 at the midpoint versus our previous guidance of $16.10 to $16.30. Third, relative to Gen AI, we feel we're structurally advantaged and excited by this technology as our vertical and application specific businesses, we use our specialized market positions and knowledge to provide context to these enabling technologies both to create customer value and internal productivity gains more on this during today's call. And finally, we continue to be well positioned relative to capital deployment. We remain active in the market as we evaluate and actively diligence many high quality opportunities. Jason, I'll turn the call over to you so you can walk through our second quarter results and our very strong financial position. Jason?
Jason Conley: Thanks, Neil, and I hope everyone is doing well this morning. Turning to slide six, the seconf quarter was another good post in 2023. Revenue came in at $1.53 billion, which was up 17% over prior year. Organic growth was 9%, which was led by 8% software recurring revenue growth across the enterprise and outsized growth 19% in our tech enable product segment. EBITDA increased 20% to $617 million with EBITDA operating leverage of 46%. Notably, margin expanded across all three segments in the quarter. DEPS of $4.12 was $0.12 above the high-end of our guidance range and 20% above prior year. DEPS growth was in line with EBITDA growth given the offsetting impact of a higher tax rate and lower net interest expense. Moving to free cash flow. As a reminder, the second quarter is always our lowest conversion quarter in the year as we make two federal tax payments. We delivered $295 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which was up 17% over prior year. As I previously mentioned, Frontline’s cash flow is seasonally weighted to Q3 and Q4, especially in Q3 and this is in line with our K-12 customers' annual renewals. So we expect a meaningful increase to cash flow in the second half. Taking broader view of cash flow on this slide, recall that we acquired Vertafore in 2020 and had a one-time cash tax benefit of $120 million, of which about $60 million benefited the second quarter of 2021. We've therefore had very strong multi-year cash flow performance when normalizing for this 2021 tax item. For the year, we are confident that free cash flow will be greater than 30% of revenue. Turning to our balance sheet on slide seven. Our net leverage sits at 2.2 times at the end of the quarter with about $6.7 billion of debt and just under $1.5 billion of cash against our TTM EBITDA of $2.35 million. Also our $3.5 billion revolver remains fully undrawn. To summarize, we have significant acquisition capacity and remain quite active in many bespoke processes. To that end, in Q3, we expect to close on Replicon, which is a bolt-on acquisition for our Deltek business with a purchase price of $450 million or about $370 million net of a long-term cash tax benefit. Neil will discuss the details around this exciting addition to the Deltek platform in the segment discussion. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to talk about our segment performance and outlook. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Jason. Let's turn to page nine and walk through our Q2 highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $770 million, up 6% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins increased to 43.7% in the quarter. In this segment, we continue to see consistently strong performance across the entire group of companies. We'll start with Deltek. Deltek was once again solid across both our government contracting and private sector businesses. Importantly, Deltek continues to see momentum build with our SaaS offerings and retention rates remain at historically high levels. Also in the quarter and as Jason mentioned earlier, we announced the acquisition of Replicon for Deltek, Roper’s largest bolt-on today. Replicon is a market leading timekeeping and workforce management SaaS solution focused on professional services firms and it's highly complementary to Deltek strategy. We expect Replicon to contribute north of $70 million of revenue and $24 million of EBITDA next year and we expect the deal to close during the third quarter. Finally, as it relates to Deltek, we wanted to brag on them for a moment. During the quarter, the Washington Post award Deltek, the number four top workplace at the D.C. Metro Area for large companies. As you know, we have a closely held belief that talent and culture can create long-term competitive advantage and this is certainly the case for Deltek. During Roper's ownership with Deltek, the company has increased its organic growth rate, retention levels, recurring revenue and margin structure and a big contributor to that success is the structural talent advantage that Deltek continues to build. Congrats to Mike and congrats to your entire team. Aderant, our software business focused on the needs of law firms continues to be excellent. In the quarter, Aderant saw record bookings and continued success in the adoption and cross-sell of their SaaS solutions. Also and importantly during the quarter, Aderant launched their Generative AI enabler, MADDI. Today, MADDI is enabling two solutions outside counsel guidelines management and time entry, with plans to extend this to AR cash receipt matching and docketing over the coming months. Over time MADDI will be integrated widely across Aderant’s product platforms. Generative AI for a legal space has tremendous potential. One such example in the market today is Onyx. Onyx powered by MADDI solves a massive challenge that all law firms face, namely how to navigate outside counsel guidelines or the billing requirements that clients impose on their law firms. It's fairly common for a large law firm to have to navigate 100s of 1,000s of bespoke client billing requirements. Today, Onyx uses Generative AI to extract contractual terms and convert them into business tools used in the time entry and billing processes, a true game changer. More broadly across Roper, we're excited about the potential of Generative AI and large language models. We believe given our deeply verticalized and application specific business model that our businesses are structurally advantaged given that all AI, computational and generative need context specifically dated workflows and wish to train or target the technology. Internally, we're working closely with our businesses on the productivity and product enabled opportunities associated with Gen AI. Certainly much more to come on this. Now back to the segment performance in Vertafore, our software business at tech-enabled property and casualty insurance agencies. Vertafore continues to be a great asset for us with solid performance across our core P&C business and their recent MGA Solutions bolt-on. Our Healthcare/IT businesses also performed very well in the quarter with growth in each of our Healthcare/IT franchises, Clinisys, Data Innovations and Strata. Frontline also continues to deliver for us. Frontline's mission is to empower the frontline of education. As many of you know, the hiring of teachers and administrative staff is particularly challenging and frontline software solutions better equip K-12 school district to navigate these challenges. Because of this, frontline solutions are mission critical and of high importance to their school district customers. As such, frontline's net retention is consistently strong. Looking to the second-half of the year, we expect to see organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digits area for the segment. Overall, very strong results and outlook for this segment. Turning to page 10. Revenues in the quarter for our Network Software segment were $358 million, up 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were strong at 54.2%. As with our Application Software segment, growth and performance was solid across the segment. Relative to business specific comments, we'll start with our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses, DAT & Loadlink, both of which grew in the quarter despite continued challenges across the broader freight and logistics markets. I'll remind you that our businesses are critical to the operation and execution of the North American spot freight market. In addition and importantly the spot market is a long-term secular beneficiary in terms of the volume of future great ships. Throughout and across the freight and economic cycle DAT & Loadlink continue to innovate and launch new products and offerings to help drive enhanced customer value and share of wallet. As we speak, DAT is launching a Generative AI enabled solution among other initiatives targeted to combat freight industry fraud. This is in addition to their existing set of computational AI and data science driven solutions like DAT iQ, which they deploy at scale over the last three or four years. By pipeline, our network software business that tech enables the distribution channel for life insurance and annuities had very nice ARR gains in the quarter driven by strong retention and customer expansion activity. Foundry continued its string of strong performance and had terrific growth for their flagship product Nuke, which enabled continued double-digit recurring revenue growth. As we mentioned last quarter foundry commenced their subscription pricing transition for Nuke and the first-half of the year had north of 60% of their new units sold under their new model ahead of their transition plan. Finally, our alternate site health care businesses led by SoftWriters and SHP were strong in the quarter. Execution was solid and the business has benefited by an improving census and skilled nursing assisted living facilities and home health reaching the highest occupancy levels in patient volumes since the onset of the pandemic. Turning to the second-half of the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment based on sustained ARR momentum. As we turn to page 11, revenues in the quarter for our tech-enabled product segment were $403 million, up 19% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for this segment were strong at 36.4% for the quarter. Across this segment, business performance and execution was exceptional. Importantly, the broad-based supply chain issues continued to ease. Neptune, our water meter, and technology product business continues to be great. In the quarter, they had record revenue performance. Importantly, Neptune continues to see increasing demand and momentum for their residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters. We remain bullish about Neptune and the market in which they compete. Given this market tends to be quite steady as Neptune's customers’ budgets are typically fixed year-to-year and not tied to broader macroeconomic trends or cycles. Verathon was awesome in the quarter as well with double-digit order growth and tremendous operational execution. Specifically, Verathon saw strength across their reoccurring single use products, both Bronchoscope or B-Flex and video innovation or GlideScope, as well as bladder scan capital purchases. Northern Digital or NDI was also strong in the quarter setting a record revenue for the business. A group of smaller businesses here, IPA, rf IDEAS and Inovonics were fantastic in the quarter as they substantially work through a series of nagging supply chain challenges. Relative to the second-half of the year, we expect to see high-single-digit organic revenue growth. Recall, we have a tough Q3 revenue and margin comp to lap from the prior year. Now please turn to page 13, and let's review our increased 2023 guidance. Based on our strong second quarter performance, we're raising our full-year 2023 guidance for total revenue, organic revenue, and adjusted DEPS. For 2023, we now expect total revenue growth to be around 13%, an increase from 12% plus last quarter. In addition, we're raising our full-year organic revenue outlook to be in the 7% zip codes, an increase from 6% to 7% last quarter and 5% to 6% in our original guide. As a result of our improved revenue outlook, we're increasing our debt guidance to be in the range of $16.36 and $16.50, up for our prior guidance of $16.10 to $16.30. Assumed in this guidance is a tax rate trending to the high-end our 21% to 22% range. Specific to the third quarter, we're establishing our debt guidance to be in the range of $4.16 and $4.20. Now please turn with us to page 14, and then we'll look forward to answering your questions. We want to leave you with the same four points with which we started. First, the year started strong and we delivered solid second quarter results. In the quarter, we saw revenues increased 17% to $1.53 billion. This growth was underpinned with 9% organic revenue growth and 8% organic software recurring revenue growth. In addition, EBITDA margins were quite strong at 40.3%. Second, based on the strong second quarter performance, the recurring nature of our revenue stream and the importance of our solutions to our customers, we're increasing our full-year total and organic revenue growth outlook and increasing our full-year DEPS outlook to be between $16.36 and $16.50. Third, we're excited by the potential of Generative AI, both as it relates to internal productivity and using our application specificity to provide context for new product development ideas. We look forward to sharing progress and updates in coming quarters and years. And finally, we continue to be active with our capital deployment activities as we have north of $4 billion of available M&A firepower. As we've been discussing over the past several months, we have a very large pipeline of opportunities, though as always, we remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure the continued optimal deployment of our available capital. Now as we turn to your questions and if you flip to the final slide our strategic flywheel, we'll want to once again thank those of you who joined us in New York for our first ever Investor Day and for the 100s who have watched the replay over the past few months. During that long form overview of Roper, we were excited to share with you our long-term strategy, the high quality nature of our portfolio of businesses; our operating ability to improve our businesses, our process driven capital deployment approach and our compelling long-term business model that compounds cash flow in the mid-teens area. So thank you for your continued interest in Roper. And with that, let's open it up to your questions.
Operator: Yes, thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just the first question around in Network Software, you had a very strong margin performance up over 200 points of only mid-single-digit organic growth. So I just wondered if there was anything driving that perhaps on mix or anything kind of one-time? And then also in that division, how are you thinking about second-half growth in DAT & Loadlink versus first-half?
Jason Conley: Hey, good morning, Julian. It's Jason. So yes, I mean, I think we had the strong performance across a lot of the businesses. I think the -- by the one standout is our ConstructConnect business. We acquired a bolt-on that we closed last year and we're seeing -- realizing the benefits from that deal. And then like I said, beyond that, it's just across the segment.
Neil Hunn: And relative to your second question, second-half for DAT & Loadlink, our freight match businesses. We continue to be cautious there and conservative. We've been held that posture the whole year. DAT performed very well in the quarter, it grew high-single-digits. The broker part of the business and the data analytics part of the business remains super solid, high retention rates. But as we all know, the carrier side of the market, the excess carriers are trading out of the market and that has a weighing effect on DAT. So we've modeled that in all year long and it's playing out generally in line with what we thought here in Sarasota, maybe a touch better, but we'll just stay in line with Sarasota's expectations. And relative to the second-half for DAT, the big wildcard is what happens with Yellow and [EPSI] (ph). I mean, so we'll see what happens there could be a pickup for the spot market, if something were to turn negative on either one or both of those.
Julian Mitchell: That's interesting. Thank you. And then just as we look at the second-half guidance, you called out in TEP the tough comp for third quarter. Just one other thing I wanted to check on the back half. It looks like the guidance implies fourth quarter DEPS doesn't really go up much sequentially in Q4. Historically, you've had often a mid-single-digit type EPS increase in Q4 sequentially. I just wondered if that was just kind of conservatism in the construct for this year. Or if there's anything specific going on?
Jason Conley: Nothing really specific sequentially. I mean, I think we've talked about a little bit about just the seasonal shutdown at Neptune. We've had that historically, but I wouldn't point to any conservatism and we've got, sort of, networks still at mid-single-digits. So maybe in the prior year, you might have seen some acceleration coming in the fourth quarter, but nothing really unusual there. What is your first question, sorry, Julian?
Julian Mitchell: Oh, no that was really just around if there was anything on the fourth quarter to kind of call out, but it doesn't -- it sounds like this year should be fairly typical in terms of seasonality.
Jason Conley: Correct.
Neil Hunn: Correct.
Julian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: Yes. Thanks.
Jason Conley: Thanks, Julian.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Jason Conley: Good morning.
Deane Dray: Hey, can we start with just broadly the tone of business. There was a reference in the first quarter and I think also at the Analyst Day that you were seeing some slower customer decision making. But the way I look at this quarter with the upside on the organic side and the outlook, has that improved? And very specifically, would you measure that in new logos and SaaS conversions, but just kind of that tone of business, please?
Neil Hunn: Yes. I would characterize it. Our software businesses are playing out -- about as we expected coming into the year, right, expecting a little bit of a slowdown. So you see delayed decision making that has pushes out net new sales, but it also has the impact of having higher gross retention, because decisions are being deferred. And then also just the amount of expansion activities that we have activity we have with our customers is a little bit less, as our customers are just more cautious as they look forward. So that's playing out about as we expected. It's not acute and any one of our businesses is just sprinkled across the universe of our portfolio. Relative to TEP, I mean, it was just fantastic. We had a lot of demand in the medical businesses remains very strong especially at Verathon and CIVCO, a lot of supply chain clear up in the first-half, especially in the second quarter. And we called out very rarely do we call out the three small businesses that we did on the slide, but they had just terrific supply chain sort of performance and operational performance in the quarter.
Deane Dray: Yes. That's really good to hear. And just as a follow-up, can we talk about the impact AI is having and how you're evaluating M&A candidates. So is there an eye towards the barriers to entry Roper is focused on these deep domain expertise types of deep vertical. So how do you look at where and how AI might be a threat to these? How do you look at the candidates in terms of where and how AI might advance their business model and just what has changed there?
Neil Hunn: Yes. I think it's certainly a consideration today. We're computationally, AI has been a consideration for a few years. Generative is newer this year. I think the thing that is nice about our portfolio, our M&A strategy is it just happens to play into the strength of where generative AI and computation AI is best suited. So more verticalized, more application-specific, more intimacy with customers. And so our M&A approach is well suited given the development of these technologies. And as always, you've heard us say this for decades, we're looking in our capital deployment. If there's a zero in the Monte Carlo, we can envision a doomsday, then we're out. We're just not going to lean into that. So we'll look at -- we always look at that. And to the extent we can dream up as zero in the Monte Carlo, because of generative computational AI, then we're not going to consider it in any way. So that's not a new thing for us. Anything to add, Jason?
Jason Conley: No, I think that's right. And any sort of content type business, we've always steered away from, and I think this is just accentuates that with the advent of AI and Generative AI.
Deane Dray: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Vruwink, Robert W. Baird & Company.
Joe Vruwink: Great. hi, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Hey, good morning.
Joe Vruwink: Hey, good morning. If I go back to last quarter, I think you referenced the Leadership Summit and the business unit presidents coming together. This quarter, there was an announcement about iPipeline and Vertafore partnering together on product. Is it may be possible to connect these two things together? So by doing more to share best practices across the operating divisions, can Roper actually uncover incremental product opportunities and maybe offering a broader suite when it comes to certain end markets that are jointly served today?
Neil Hunn: Yes. I think there's definitely and demonstrably benefits for getting our leaders together unequivocally. It's going to be more in sharing best practices, sharing leadership philosophy, sharing failures and what they learn from the failure. It's going to be more about how do you lead, how do you manage, how do you inspire teams for terrific performance it's going to be less on connection with the product teams, because most of our businesses are in independent and disconnected markets and swim lanes. So if there's something that makes sense, we'll certainly do it. If it doesn't make sense, we won't. The good news about this particular iPipeline and Vertafore is it happened organically between the businesses without any push from the center. So you know that's authentic and it's going to drive value for our customers.
Joe Vruwink: Okay. That's helpful. Just on the topic of generative AI. As you say, your businesses, they provide the context that the applications need, so growth retention if anything, is biased higher in many aspects. How do you think about net retention and just participating in new avenues for growth. So with some of the early products discussed today, does that really strengthen the core? Or is there a separate monetization that can happen?
Neil Hunn: No, no. I think there's definitely monetization that could happen. It will happen over time. There's no silver bullet in the short run. We play the long game, build for long-term customer value of relationships. But there's just massive amounts of value that can be created by doing things with both computation on generative AI. And our relationship with our customers are such that we're, at least for the last 20-years, we're able to capture our fair share of the value that's created. So I don't know why that would be any different going forward. And then as we all know, there's a tremendous amount of value or productivity to capture inside the four walls of our businesses using Generative AI as well.
Joe Vruwink: Great. Thank you very much.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Jason Conley: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. I saw the announcement with IntelliTrans sort of stepping out and partnering with the product sensor business. Is that something that's just unique to IntelliTrans? Or is it something that you're doing to sort of leverage that sort of asset-light business that you have? Any thoughts there?
Neil Hunn: No, that's very, very bespoke to IntelliTrans. I mean there's not an enterprise-wide strategy to do anything like that nor would we -- if there was, we wouldn't push it down. It's anathetical to what Roper is about. So it's very bespoke to IntelliTrans. Gold star for asking IntelliTrans question, by the way.
Allison Poliniak: It helps also covering transports. So -- and then just on tech-enabled products, that business continues to outperform organically. You mentioned difficult comps in Q3. Is there any more color you can give us to the cadence between Q3 and Q4 to, kind of, reach that target? And what sort of drove that outperformance this quarter? Thanks.
Jason Conley: Yes. So this is Jason. I think it's a pretty consistent cadence in terms of the quarters. What I would say is the outperformance in Q3 was really across the board. We had -- Neptune continues to execute really well in their backlog. Their daily sales are up over their plan. Health care is doing really well in terms of procedures. So just executing on a kind of book-and-ship basis there. And then our -- some of our [Technical Difficulty] product businesses had some backlog that finally got cleared. So that really drove the Q3. And then the second-half, like I said, organic growth should be fairly consistent. It's just what we had last year. We had a lot of backlog clear in the third quarter that with very high-margin products. So that's sort of the comp issue that we're lapping in the third quarter.
Allison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist.
Terry Tillman: Yes. Good morning. Can you all hear me, gentlemen?
Neil Hunn: We can hear you perfect.
Jason Conley: Yes, all good.
Terry Tillman: Wonderful. Happy Friday, Neil, Jason, and such. Maybe the first question, it's almost technically two questions, but I'm going to call it 1.5 questions, is actually back on Deltek, one of your biggest businesses, if not biggest business on the app software side. I'm just curious on the relative health and demand. Somebody earlier asked about macro, but how the government side is performing versus private sector side? And the second part of that first question is it seems like something with Replicon, and I think you said it's about $70 million. You could have some pretty good revenue synergy opportunities. And how do you think about that $70 million business, kind of, unleashing that product into that large Deltek installed base? And then I have a follow-up.
Neil Hunn: So we'll call that two questions, 50 degrees. But the Deltek demand, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, our performance was solid across both government contracting and private sector. We are encouraged by the pipeline build in the quarter for Q4 and early ‘24 in government contracting. There definitely was a little bit of a lull or an air pocket in government contracting relative to the debt ceiling. And so it was nice to see activity get back to normalize or maybe slightly better than normalized activities relative to early pipeline build, so that was encouraging to see. You've got to see how that plays out, for sure. Replicon, you know, we really like this bolt-on. As we said, it's the largest bolt-on we've done at $450 million, $370 million net of the tax benefit. It's time entry without attachment to an ERP. So time only is a highly demanded solution in the PS world. It is not sold today in government contracting. And so we have not underwritten into a revenue synergy opportunity. That's not part of the $70 million or the $2 million that we talked about. But it is certainly the expectation over time is to get Deltek takes this product in other core market of government contracting.
Terry Tillman: Got it. And thanks for being generous, yes, I guess this technically is the third question. Then on the idea of the M&A pipeline and you talked about you're just kind of working through opportunities and bespoke situations, et cetera. But compared to like 90-days ago, would you suggest that there's more -- it's more actionable on the bolt-ons versus the potential platform deals. Just maybe a temperature gauge on the stack ranking of the two types.
Neil Hunn: Yes. So it's been an interesting 90-days. So we continue to be active. Our pipeline still skews more towards bolt-ons for sure. More broadly in the market over the last 90-days, we are encouraged by the fact that there are a couple of sizable deals private that did not happen, because the buyer universe rejected the seller's expectation on value. And so we view that as in the deal ultimately did not consummate. So we view that as actually an encouraging sign around as an early indicator that valuations are going to pull in to being a more normalized with cost of capital. So we're encouraged by that. But still, our pipeline leans into the bolt-on opportunities.
Terry Tillman: That’s great. Thank you.
Jason Conley: Yes, I mean, I would say. Yes, [Multiple Speakers] are down dramatically year-over-year. And so there's just a lot of assets that, at some point, need to go. And it's been 1.5 years now, so we think it's getting closer.
Terry Tillman: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Christopher Glynn: I wanted to touch on foundry. Curious if there's any risk of any followed or perturbations from labor strike risk? And also, if you could revisit the comments on the transition plan for that?
Neil Hunn: Sure. So foundry, for those that aren't familiar with it, it's a business and media entertainment, that's used in post-production for a process called compositing, where you take a live action image and a computer-generated image and push them together in the single scenes. So think Game of Thrones, pretty much every seen in Game of Thrones was used as composite with foundry software as is almost any high-end production or streaming series. So as it turns out, I think this is the first time since 1960. We've had both a writer's trike and an actor's strike concurrently. So the current production of content is ceased. There is still a very active pipeline of things in post. And so it has no impact currently on foundry. The current expectation is the strikes will be resolved this year. And if that's the case, then there'll be very little impact foundry next year as they'll be back in production and sort of catch up. If it extends beyond this year, then yes, foundry will likely be negatively impacted to some extent next year. So that's just a lot of item for us. And your second question, Foundry this year commenced the transition to a subscription pricing model for their core product of Nuke. So this year, there are -- you can buy it either as a license or a subscription. As we mentioned, about 60%, north of 60% of the new units were sold on a subscription basis this year. So it's a nice transition ahead of our plan. ARR is growing double digits. And then beginning next year, it will be 100% subscription opportunity to buy in the license format. So going a little bit better than planned.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks for that.
Neil Hunn: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Jason Conley: Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Are you okay?
Steve Tusa: Am I okay?
Neil Hunn: Yes, okay. You sound a little froggy there, okay.
Steve Tusa: No, no, no, no, it's a little bit early. Thanks for the [Multiple Speakers] I appreciate it. So just a couple of things. Can you just talk about what you expect for third quarter free cash? Maybe just talk about the deferred revenue drag you guys have had in the first-half, what's driving that? And then just what are organic bookings year-over-year for the software businesses in the second quarter? Thanks.
Neil Hunn: Yes. So we mentioned before, Frontline is a new dynamic, right, for Roper, where all of their renewals happen in the third quarter. So we're already tracking really strong just month-to-date, if you will, for the renewals there. And they actually consumed cash in the first-half, just to give you a perspective on that. I mean also, I think we historically have very strong second-half seasonality. So that, plus just some of the -- I think some of the timing of working capital in the second quarter points to a much better second-half. First-half, we usually -- we pay out incentive. We had -- this year, we had that legal settlement. So that points to sort of that seasonal change for this year. And so we're still on track to deliver north of 30% of free cash flow to revenue. And then you asked about the trends on. So if we kind of look at enterprise software bookings, and it was up sequentially a bit and up year-over-year. Not quite as strong as the first quarter, maybe like low-singles in area, which is about in line with what we had. It's obviously embedded in sort of our slowdown for the second-half for new activity.
Steve Tusa: Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Neil Hunn: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, guys. This is [Dave] (ph) [Multiple Speakers] on for Brent. I appreciate you are taking some questions. Maybe just on the AI theme. I appreciate some of the color that you guys gave. I was curious, is there some sort of AI playbook that you guys are laying out for the portfolio of companies to be thinking through? Just curious how you're approaching that across the portfolio, and I appreciate some of those one-off case studies.
Neil Hunn: Yes. So Playbook, I would say, no, accelerated education across multiple fronts, yes. So what is it? What's are the possible? What are the risks? What are the IP ownership issues? What is how do you get productivity with -- in R&D, how do you get marketing lead productivity, marketing content productivity, customer service productivity. We're doing a series of teach-ins and learnings that is highly subscribed by our businesses. And so that's how we're sort of accelerating the learning across the enterprise.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe wanted to just ask about you guys often talk about the portfolio being mostly macro insulated. I think the macro hasn't been as bad as many have feared. But as you guys kind of think through that, have there been any companies that as things have softened a little bit that maybe have stuck out and maybe were a little surprising where you thought, hey, maybe these were a little bit more macro immune than they've been showing up to be?
Neil Hunn: Look, Jason, I think, to our surprise, no. I mean, obviously, the one that gets a lot of attention is our DAT business, which grew. It's just truly exceptional the last couple of years. And then this year, it's moderated, still growing. And we talked about that quite a bit last quarter. We -- so really nothing. I mean, Neptune is solid. As we said in the prepared remarks, their customers' budgets tend to be very fixed year-to-year and not tied to housing starts, which some people think is the case, but it generally is not. Jason, anything, so surprises?
Jason Conley: I don't think so.
Neil Hunn: There's really nothing surprising on the cyclical piece.
Jason Conley: Yes. I mean, Shannon has pointed out, maybe there's a little bit around government contracting, as I mentioned earlier, on the debt ceiling. It's not a macro point per se, but that's not clear at Deltek.
Unidentified Analyst: I understood. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.
Neil Hunn: Yes.
Jason Conley: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Jason Conley: Good morning.
Joe Ritchie: Hey, so maybe just to round out that free cash flow margin point going forward now that the seasonality has maybe changed a little bit. Should we think about them like the second quarter as being kind of like a free cash flow margin around 20% going forward as you kind of think about modeling that business?
Neil Hunn: I mean it's going to be lower. I'm not sure if I point to a specific margin for every year. But we do make 2 federal tax payments. So that obviously just drags on the second quarter. But so it's always going to be lower than the full year. So that's how I would model it.
Joe Ritchie: Okay. All right. Great. That's helpful. And then I guess, lastly, we talked a little bit about technology-enabled products and the growth this quarter, tougher comps going forward. I'm just curious, is there a way to potentially quantify the supply chain easing impact that occurred this quarter? And then is that going to continue? I guess is that part of the headwind then potentially as you kind of -- as you think about the second-half of the year?
Neil Hunn: That might be hard. We might have to -- I mean mid-single-digit growth is normal for that segment. And then we got to parse how much might be strength at Verathon and SIFCO that might be a little bit recurring on top of that, but then the balance may be -- the balance would be the supply chain sort of pull and a release.
Joe Ritchie: Okay, I think we can always follow-up offline. Thank you, guys.
Neil Hunn: You bet.
Jason Conley: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn it back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-27 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the first quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we used a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and the financial impacts associated with our minority investment in Indicor. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now, if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Zach and we hope everyone is doing well this morning. We're looking forward to sharing our Q1 results with you which were quite good. As we turn to Page 4, let's look at today's agenda. We'll start with our enterprise highlights and financial results, then turn to our segment-specific discussion and wrap up discussing our raised 2023 enterprise guidance. So with that, let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the 3 main takeaways for today's call are, first, the year is off to a strong operational and financial start as our higher-quality, enhanced portfolio is obviously performing really well; second, we're increasing our full year guidance both in terms of organic revenue growth and adjusted DEPS; and third, we continue to be very well positioned for disciplined capital deployment. As it relates to our first takeaway, a strong start to the year, we saw total revenue grow of 15% and organic revenue grow 8%. Consistent with our long-standing strategy, we continue to not only scale our enterprise but also simultaneously improve its underlying quality and recurring revenue base. Importantly, we had very strong cash flow performance with free cash flow margins in excess of 30%. Our results this quarter are another proof point that our higher-quality, less cyclical portfolio was purpose-built to consistently perform at a very high level. Finally and also during the quarter, we held our first ever Roper Leadership Summit, where we had our 27 business unit presidents together and shared best practices and learnings across a variety of topics, including strategy development, strategy enablement and team and talent. While honoring our high trust autonomous model, the operating and corporate teams left feeling a true sense of community. It was a terrific week. Given the strong start to the year, we're increasing our full year organic growth outlook 100 basis points from 5% to 6% to 6% to 7% and increasing our full year DEPS guidance to be to $16.10 to $16.30 or $15.10 at the midpoint. Our previous diluted EPS guide was $15.90 to $16.20. And finally, we continue to be well positioned relative to capital deployment. We remain quite active in the market as we evaluate an actively diligent many high-quality opportunities. Jason, I'll turn the call over to you so you can walk through our first quarter results and our strong financial position. Jason?
Jason Conley: Thanks, Neil and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Turning to Slide 6. We're very pleased with how Q1 shaped up. Revenue came in at $1.47 billion or 15% over prior year. This was through a combination of strong organic growth of 8% and an 8% contribution from acquisitions, led by Frontline and this was slightly offset by a 1% FX headwind. Growth was broad-based across the segments and a little better than expected. Broadly speaking, customer demand was favorable in the quarter and order pipelines remain strong. EBITDA was $582 million or 15% of our prior year with margins roughly flat and in line with expectations. DEPS of $3.90 was up 19% over prior year and $0.06 above the high end of our guidance range of $3.80 to $3.84. Free cash flow of $445 million was 4% higher than prior year. In our Q4 earnings call, we highlighted a $45 million settlement of a patent dispute for certain Verathon sales dating back to 2004. We paid that this quarter, so adjusted for the settlement, free cash would be 33% of revenue and up 14% over prior year. We saw very good cash performance, especially in our software businesses. Our Q1 renewals and related collections came in strong as expected. As I mentioned last quarter, Frontline will collect most of the renewals in the third quarter. So it's a bit of a drag on conversion in the first half. So overall, just a really great start to 2023. Now turning to Slide 7, we'll spin through our balance sheet. Coming off solid Q1 cash flow performance, our balance sheet continues to strengthen. Gross debt was around $6.7 billion and our cash balance has grown to just under $1.2 billion which yields net debt just shy of $5.5 billion. This puts our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 2.4 which was down from 2.7 at year-end. This, coupled with our undrawn revolver of $3.5 billion gives us capacity to deploy $4 billion or more in the near term. To that end, we've been quite active in 2023, evaluating a number of platform and bolt-on opportunities. As always, we will remain disciplined and patient in our capital deployment process. With that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to talk about our segment performance and outlook. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Jason. Let's turn to Page 9 and walk through our Q1 highlights for Application Software segment. Revenues here were $761 million, up 6% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 43.2%. Performance in this segment was strong across the board. To highlight a few of our business' performance, we'll start with Deltek. Deltek was solid. As we mentioned last quarter, Deltek did see some slower customer decision-making but that was largely rectified this quarter. Deltek had double-digit bookings in the quarter with strength across both enterprise class and SMB-sized customers as well as government contracting and private sector solutions. As usual, both gross and net retention at Deltek remained strong and consistent with recent history. Aderant, our software business focused on the needs of law firms, continues to compete and win and take share from our competitors. In the quarter, Aderant experienced record bookings and continued success in the adoption of their SaaS solutions. Great job by Chris, Rafi and the entire Aderant team. Vertafore, our software business at tech-enabled property and casualty insurance agencies, posted another solid quarter and continues to perform quite well for us. Of particular note, Vertafore's recent acquisition of MGA Systems, a software solution targeted to manage general agents, or MGAs, is proving to be highly strategic and bookings activity is tracking ahead of plan. Frontline continues to perform quite well for us in the first couple of quarters of ownership. Frontline's mission is to empower the front line of education. As many of you know, hiring of teachers and administrative staff is particularly challenging and Frontline software solutions better equip K-12 school districts to navigate these challenges. Because of this, frontline solutions are mission-critical and of high importance to their school district customers. For the segment, EBITDA margins were down 90 basis points year-over-year, in line with our expectations. Our Acute Care software businesses, especially CliniSys, Data Innovations and Strata are ramping up their implementation capacity based on recent bookings momentum. We expect to see similar margins in Q2. Looking to the balance of the year, we expect to see organic growth in the mid-single-digit area for this segment based on our leading market positions and growth in recurring revenue. Turning to Page 10. Revenues in the quarter for Network Software segment were $355 million, up 6% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were strong at 53.1%. As with our Application Software segment, growth and performance was broad-based across this segment. Relative to business-specific comments, we'll start with our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink which both grew nicely in the quarter. While freight market conditions are softer than this time last year, our businesses in this space are critical to the operation and execution of the spot freight market. In addition and importantly, the spot market is a long-term secular beneficiary in terms of the volume of future freight shipments. Throughout and across the freight and economic cycle, DAT and Loadlink continue to innovate and launch new products and offerings to help drive enhanced customer value and share of wallet with the current product strategy focused on tech enabling the connectivity between brokers and carriers. iPipeline, our network software business that tech enables the distribution channel for life insurance and annuities, is coming off a terrific 2022 and continued its high level of execution this quarter with very strong bookings, retention and customer expansions. Foundry continued its string of strong performance in the quarter and had terrific seat growth for their flagship product Newk [ph] which enabled continued double-digit recurring revenue growth. As we mentioned last quarter, Foundry commenced their subscription pricing transition for Newk [ph] and in Q1 had north of 50% of the new seats sold under their new model ahead of their plan. Finally, our alternate site health care businesses, MHA, SoftWriters and SHP were strong in the quarter. Execution was solid and the business has benefited by an improving census in skilled nursing, assisted living facilities and home health reaching the highest occupancy levels in patient volumes since the onset of the pandemic. Turning to the balance of the year. We expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment based on broad and sustained growth across this group. As we turn to Page 11. Revenues in the quarter for our Tech-enabled Products segment were $354 million, up 14% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for the segment were 34.7% in the quarter. Across the segment, business performance and execution was solid. Importantly, the broad-based supply chain issues continue to wane. Though we're not entirely out of the woods, we can now see a path to a more normalized supply chain environment. Neptune, our water meter and technology product business, continues to be just great. In the quarter, they had record revenue performance and set records for backlog levels. Importantly, Neptune continues to see increasing demand and momentum for their residential and commercial ultrasonic static meters. We remain bullish on Neptune and the market in which they compete as this market tends to be quite steady as Neptune's customers' budgets are typically fixed year-to-year and not tied to broader macroeconomic trends or cycles. Great job at Neptune and congrats. Verathon was strong in the quarter as well with double-digit order growth. Specifically, Verathon saw strength across the reoccurring single-use products, both bronchoscope or B-flex [ph] and video innovation or GlideScope as well as bladder scan capital purchases. Importantly, Verathon has 4 product launches scheduled for the next few months which will help continue their market share gains and momentum. Northern Digital or NDI was also strong in the quarter and continued to see terrific demand for their optical and EM solutions. NDI's enabling measurement technology is used by scores and medical product OEMs and solutions such as robotic-assisted surgery and across multiple cardiac-specific modalities. NDI's high level of market focus and operational discipline will enable them to continue to be the market share leader for these measurement technologies long into the future. Our outlook for the balance of the year for this segment has improved to be in the low double-digit area and is based on continued strong orders and improving manufacturing productivity at Neptune as well as an improved growth outlook across our medical product businesses. Now please turn to Page 13 and let's review our increased 2023 guidance. For 2023, we expect total revenue growth to be north of 12%. In addition, we're updating our organic revenue growth outlook to be in the 6% to 7% range, an increase from our original guidance of 5% to 6%. As a result, we're increasing our DEPS guidance to be in the range of $16.10 and $16.30 in up from our guidance of $15.90 to $16.20, assuming that this guidance is a tax rate in the 21% to 22% area. Specific to the second quarter, we're establishing our DEPS guidance is to be in the $3.96 to $4 range. Now please turn with us to Page 14 and then Jason and I will look forward to answering your questions. As we turn to Page 14, we want to leave you with the same 3 points with which we started. First, 2023 is off to a great start. We saw revenues increase 15% to $1.47 billion in the quarter. This growth was underpinned with 8% organic revenue growth and 8% recurring revenue growth. In addition, margins were quite strong. This quarter's financial and operational performance is yet another proof point of our capabilities and frankly, the expectations of our improved higher-quality portfolio of businesses. Most importantly, our revenue growth translated to impressive cash flow growth with our underlying free cash flow growing 14%. As you know, we view cash flow growth as the best measure of performance. Second, based on the strong start to the year, the higher recurring nature of our revenue stream and the importance of our solutions to our customers, we are increasing our full year organic revenue growth outlook to be between 6% and 7% and increasing our full year DEPS to be between $16.10 an $16.30. Finally, we continue to be active with our capital deployment activities as we have north of $4 billion of available M&A firepower. As we discussed during our Investor Day last month, we have a very large universe and pipeline of opportunities, though, as always, we remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital. Now as we turn to your questions and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel, we want to thank those of you who joined us in New York or online last month for our first ever Investor Day. During that long-form overview of Roper, we were excited to share with you our long-term strategy, the high-quality nature of our portfolio of businesses, our operating ability to improve our businesses, our process-driven capital deployment approach and are compelling long-term business model that compounds cash flow in the mid-teens area. So, thank you for your continued interest in Roper. And with that, let's open it up to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: It was great to see everyone in New York last month. Just maybe we can start off and it's a bit of a follow-up from last quarter with Deltek on some of the slowing in decision-making. This is kind of what everyone is watching, might there be any kind of fallout from bank turmoil or read through in the construction markets and so forth. But the idea of slower customer decision making, maybe just give us an update on how that played out, time to sign contracts, any new logos. Just any color there would be helpful.
Neil Hunn: Yes. Sure, Deane. Happy to talk about it. it's something that we spent a tremendous amount of time talking to our leadership teams, our group executives about, trying to understand the signal. To set the obvious context, we spent the last several years trying to really work out the cyclicality of the portfolio and we're also in these very small niche markets where the customers tend to be not that cyclical. So the signal for us is faint. It's not nonexistent but it's faint. Last quarter, we certainly talked about Deltek and them having some slower customer demand, as we said in the prepared comments, that largely, it's not fully rectified itself this most recent quarter. Two or three quarters ago, we talked about the same thing going on a PowerPlan, that rectified itself the subsequent quarter as well. Some of the other macro things that we listen to, the amount of property casualty insurance written as a sign of sort of business formation or business growth continued to grow, life insurance applications that got steady. DAT, the number of carriers we expected and certainly have seen for a couple of quarters, carrier declines at touch. But that meaningfully moderated in Q1. So we continue to listen for it but -- and we certainly have planned for the second half of the year, concern outlook relative to a slowdown. But the signal's faint at the moment. Jason, anything you want to add to that?
Jason Conley: Yes I would just say our software bookings were up high single digits year-over-year in the quarter. So that just put some math behind what he was saying.
Deane Dray: Great. That's really helpful and appreciate kind of that walk through the portfolio there on sensitivity. And then just second question, it was nice to see the boost in organic revenue guide for the back of the year in tech-enabled products up low double digits. And just with the expectation, look, Neptune continues to do really well and we see that in the industry. That tends to be a bit steady. So how is it that you're seeing this acceleration and must be also on the medical side, too?
Neil Hunn: Yes. There's 3 parts to this -- macro parts to this segment. There's Neptune, medical products and then a couple of small RF product businesses, all 3, they have and -- we, at corporate, sort of increased the outlook for the balance of the year. Neptune has just continued incredible order growth and then terrific performance out of the factory at Neptune which gives us confidence that they can chew into a little bit more of the backlog than we maybe originally thought coming into the year. At the medical product businesses, as we all know, last year, medical procedure volumes were down in the 7% to 8% range. We plan for that to continue this year. It's actually been a little bit better than that and that flowed through at Verathon, CIVCO directly and less directly through NDI. And then the Inovonics and RF Ideas, the RF product businesses, have been riddled with supply chain challenges and coming into the year. We assume those would continue and they meaningfully improved in Q1. So it's a little bit uplift across the board that gives us the confidence to take the guide up in that segment.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.
Scott Davis: I know it's not -- there isn't any particular business that's game changing for you in any particular quarter. But when you think about freight matching and I know the truckers have had some tough time this quarter. Some of the guidance has been a little cautious, tough comps, et cetera. How linked is your freight matching business to kind of the miles driven and the B2C kind of truck market? Is there a direct link there? I would assume there is but I'm just -- it doesn't seem like you had really any major problems in DAT this quarter.
Neil Hunn: Yes. DAT grew in the quarter. Year-over-year, it grew sequentially. So -- but there is a link. It's an indirect link. We're not paid per mile driven, we're not paid on any utilization metric. It's a fixed subscription on both the broker side and the carrier side. The reason DAT historically tends to be less cyclical than the market in which it operates, a couple of things. One is you have this tension between the cyclical nature and the secular growth driver, where the spot market is just winning more market share of the total freight volumes. So you have more volume generally coming into the spot market over the long arc of time. And the simple version for why that is, is because the spot market is becoming more liquid or easier to transact in as it tech enables itself, of which DAT is a participant and enabler of that. The second thing is understanding the dynamic between what the role the spot market plays in a booming versus a waning market, where in the -- and it's about the pricing dynamic between contract pricing and spot pricing. Spot pricing changes daily, contract pricing changes on a rolling year basis. And so when the market is very hot, you obviously have more demand for carriers and there is supply, rates up in the spot market. It invites capacity addition. And that's what's driven DAT's growth for the last couple of 3 years as you have more carriers coming into the market. When the freight market slows, you actually have spot pricing below that of contract and you actually, at that moment, start seeing some of the contract freight come into the spot market so the shippers can save money. So it provides you a floor for the demand of carriers. And so historically, DAT grows very nicely in upmarket and grow slower in the downmarket for those couple of reasons.
Scott Davis: That's interesting. Hate to [indiscernible] here but I'm just going to do it anyways. What's the -- how does this business change over time? Like does AI become a big enabler and a predictor and help kind of drive that liquidity that you talked about, Neil? How does technology, I guess, change the game and help you guys gain share over time, I think is a better question.
Neil Hunn: Yes. I mean -- there's a lot of tech currents and cross currents in this space. At the core of it, today, I still think on average, there's between 8 and 10 phone calls that go between a broker and a carrier to actually broker a load. Obviously, what we're all trying to do is take that to 0. DAT is a big part of their product road map is to tech enable that. So there's AI in the match, there's AI in the routing, there's AI in future trucks going from Cincinnati, Chicago, it's going to be there on Tuesday at 3. How does it have a pickup in Chicago back to where it wants to go 4 hours later or whatever the time frame is. There's a lot of AI that can go into that. But the principle, the true unlock for the industry is to take the -- make the match more efficient and that's where most of the technology investment is going today.
Scott Davis: Okay, that's helpful.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist.
Terry Tillman: Congrats on the quarter. So the first question, I guess, is on the Frontline because that was the last major platform acquisition. I think you all talked about $370 million of revenue, expected contribution and $170 million EBITDA. And I think also you said it was a stub period, it was in the 80s and 4Q. What I'm curious about is how is it tracking to those targets. And I did notice they just announced a new HCM suite, there's a new CRO there. So it seems like there's some dynamic things going on. Just maybe double-clicking on Frontline and then I had a follow-up for Jason.
Neil Hunn: You do the -- you take the first one.
Jason Conley: I take the first one. Yes. So they're tracking on their forecast. As you know, they're a business that has large renewals in the third and fourth quarter. And so we'll expect the business to pick up sequentially in the second half but there are definitely on track for their revenue and EBITDA numbers of $370 million, $175 million.
Neil Hunn: Yes. And as it relates to the new products and a couple of new leaders, we're certainly excited to have Bill a new CFO, Scott, our new COO; and Curtis, the new Chief Client Operations Officer joined. It's often case times the case. There's a few leadership changes that happen in the first year or so of ownership. And so that was expected, we're excited to have this team. It's an incredible group that's joined us. The thing that we -- that I'm particularly excited about and proud of in the first couple of quarters of ownership of Frontline is the strategic choice they've made. As a pattern we see from a lot of companies that come out of private equity is very limited choice that's made, so they try to do too many things and not do them well. And so very quickly, Frontline doubled down on client experience and R&D productivity and actually made a choice to take a little bit of resource out of go-to-market which makes complete sense when you have 85% or 90% coverage of the customers. And the entire strategy or the principal here strategy is to focus on cross-selling, up-selling. You need to deliver a tremendous experience, hence, to focus on client experience and need to be able to innovate and sell them more products, hence the deployment to R&D. So we love the choice that's been made there and excited for what that yields in the future.
Terry Tillman: That's great color. I guess just a follow-up for Jason is you were able to call out the adjustment from the settlement. So it was up 14% in terms of the free cash flow at low 30s on a free cash flow margin. Should we think about that for the remainder of the year in terms of kind of that mid-teens growth and maintaining a low 30s free cash flow margin?
Jason Conley: Yes, that's right. We're on track to deliver north of 30% free cash flow. As I mentioned, the second half is going to be better than the first half with the renewals at Frontline. But yes, we're still on track there.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa: A couple of the businesses that you guys didn't mention but I think to Deane's question around what's going on out there. ConstructConnect, what are you seeing there? And then perhaps Clinisys, another one of your kind of big ones.
Neil Hunn: Sure. So ConstructConnect, as we talked about in the past, tends to be a countercyclical business. For those that are less familiar, ConstructConnect for simplicity has a near perfect database of every commercial construction project that's in the planning phase. And so if you're a general contractor, a trade contractor, a building product manufacturer, you're generally quite interested in understanding for planning purposes, for bidding a project purposes what's in the stage of development planning. When the construction market is quite hot, general contractors and subs have more work that they can do. There's less utility and value in paying a subscription fee for future projects that are in the queue. When the amount of work starts to slow down, there is increased utility in that. So when I look back and back test ConstructConnect over a couple of cycles, it has a clear countercyclical demand behavior attached to it. So the market, we think, will be coming to it. As a general matter, ConstructConnect has maybe modestly underperformed our hopes. It's been more of a low single-digit growth business. Our expectation is that it should be mid. And we're quite confident with the current strategy that will climb to there and get to there. We have a great leader that came out from Deltek a couple of years ago, Matt Straza, the operational discipline, the strategy, the go-to-market sort of prowess is just at the next level. And so we're quite confident that we're going to be able to reach our expectations of mid there. CliniSys has been nothing short of great. Simpson, who's been -- who has integrated the U.S. Sunquest business with the European business, has just done that almost without error. It's been terrific. The business grew. The combined business grew in the quarter. We haven't been able to say that for quite some time given the drag of the U.S. business. We continue to be just tremendously strong in the U.K. As you know, we're 1 of 3 or 4 strategic IT vendors to the NHS as we run something like 80% or 85% of the laboratory network in the U.K. The pan-European strength continues. For instance, we run the largest health system in France, in APP, the Paris system. And in the U.S., some of the strength comes from the fact that we now have a product offering that is for laboratories outside of that of health care. So think environmental, toxicology, water, et cetera which is showing some early signs of promise. And so a lot of congratulations to Simpson and Andy, the CFO and we're excited to see what happens at Clinisys.
Steve Tusa: Great. And then just one last one on free cash flow. It's a very pretty strong quarter, upside surprise, at least versus what we were expecting. A little bit bigger of a drag from deferred but maybe a bit lower cash taxes or something. Just talk about the moving parts there and how you expect that to trend sequentially over the next couple of quarters on free cash.
Jason Conley: Sure. Yes, I can take that, Steve. So yes, the deferred revenue is down or, I guess, the consumption of cash in the first quarter because of Frontline, right? So they -- you'll see that spike back up in the third quarter with those renewals. It was, overall, deferred revenue outside of that was in line with expectations. It was fairly flat to the fourth quarter. And then on taxes, we typically make 2 tax payments: federal tax payments in the second quarter and then one in the third and one in the fourth. So we will expect Q2 to be down sequentially but up year-over-year. And then just overall, for the full year, as I mentioned earlier, just north of 30% free cash flow margin, so on track there.
Steve Tusa: Yes, great. And then sorry, just one last quick one. The high single-digit bookings number, was that an organic number for software? .
Neil Hunn: Yes.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Julian Mitchell: Just a question on tech-enabled products first. So you're seeing a lot of sort of hardware manufacturers in our group with a big kind of flush of revenue right now as component shortages ease and then there's obviously a lot less visibility on the forward look once that flows through. So just wanted to tap -- very strong revenue performance in Q1. You're very confident in the sort of the next 3 quarters' outlook. Maybe just drill down a little bit more into sort of orders and backlog trends there, just kind of the confidence that the strength right now is sustainable through year-end and not just to kind of flush as supply chain eases.
Neil Hunn: Yes. So it's something that we -- a couple of things we've been really quizzing and with our companies is 2 things, this very thing and then also the stability of the backlog has there been any order fall out of the backlog, right? So there's been none, by the way -- virtually none on backlog order fallout. The orders are quite strong. Book-to-bill was greater than 1 in the quarter. So it gives us, I think, a good indication that it's not just a flush backlog. In terms of the balance of the year though, I mean, we're waiting for the time when -- a lot of what's happened across the whole complex, not just us, is order duration is extended, right, as customers that want to be in the queue to make sure they have supply. At some point and at that point, I don't know -- I don't think any of us know what is going to happen, we're going to get back into a more normal order sort of duration timing. So there'll be a period of time when orders, because of timing, compress. It's -- we don't know when that's going to happen but we're fully expecting it. And candidly, aren't going to be that worried about it because it's sort of a natural reaction to where we are. We also -- so that's a commentary for Neptune in the whole segment. For medical products, quite the opposite. There isn't really -- we don't work out of a huge backlog out of that -- those businesses. And so that dynamic that you're addressing or question doesn't exist. And then for -- we really solved the supply chain challenges at the RF product businesses. They were bespoke and unique to the 2 businesses there. And so now we will be able to start clearing some backlog but that's more of a second half thing than what it was in the quarter.
Julian Mitchell: That's very helpful. And then just circling back on one of the more potentially cyclical pieces within software and it's already been touched on once or twice. But to try and put a finer point on the sort of DAT and Loadlinked businesses at Network Software. Within that sort of mid-single-digit growth outlook for the segment for the balance of the year, how -- what are you dialing in for sort of DAT or Loadlink? Not -- you don't have to give me the percentage number. Just curious sort of versus the segment growth of mid-single digit, for example.
Neil Hunn: Yes. So it's the same -- I'll give you a color to it. I think we'll stop short of giving you like specifics at a company level. But as we mentioned last quarter, there is a difference of opinion between the DAT leadership and Sarasota about what the outlook of this business is for the year. DAT is much more bullish on what the year -- the balance of the year is going to look like than what we are here in Sarasota. We continue to have a very conservative posture relative to what DAT looks like, especially uniquely on the carrier count for the balance of the year. We want to see -- while we had a nice proof point in Q1 that the carrier decline started to basically flatten, we have not assumed they continue from that level and improve. We continue -- we assume they actually get a little bit worse.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joe Giordano: So just kind of talk about this on the medical product side but we had another company talking about like big inventory levels of component parts in medical, like -- kind of like unexpectedly so. So like their customers just have some of their -- more of their products than anticipated. I'm guessing that's not really relevant to you guys but I just wanted to ask the question.
Neil Hunn: It's not particularly relevant. There's one business, Northern Digital, correct me on this I think it's just -- principally one that sells through, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the medical product OEMs were a critical component, a necessary component to scores of these medical product OEMs. They cannot ship their product without our product, obviously. So there was -- we're worried there might have been a fair amount of inventory in the channel as buffer. The commentary from the Northern Digital team this quarter is they feel most if not all of that is through the system. It's hard to know exactly for sure but that's where -- that's really the only place where it happens. Otherwise, it's us directly to a customer -- and in consumer customer.
Joe Giordano: Yes, that's what I figured. Okay. And then just a question on like the landscape for M&A. Like I'm just curious, from -- for your competitors on the PE side who are looking at stuff, is like the -- I know rates are kind of all over. Is the volatility of rates and like the uncertainty around rates directionally like a problem for them? And like the ability to lock in debt or the desire to lock in rates, like is that having an impact on the market at all?
Neil Hunn: Yes. I mean, it's been slow. The number of deals printed in the last couple of quarters has been very low for this reason that you mentioned for the reason that there's just a bid-ask spread between buyers and sellers. -- that continues to exist. And then also just uncertainty on what the exit values are going to be. If you're doing a IRR analysis, the most sensitive variable and the whole thing is your exit value, your exit multiple. And so all in uncertainty, there just hasn't been a lot of deals or recaps. Private equity -- in private equity, there's been a handful of strategic deals that have happened. I'll tell you though, in this our pattern recognition history would say, in times of volatility, it creates opportunity. We saw that coming out of COVID. And very quickly, I mean, it was what, August-ish and 2020 when we did Vertafore, it was an opportunity for us. And so it's our commitment to investment-grade debt, our leverage levels that we could be nimble and flexible and quite opportunistic because this -- moments like this is where opportunities exist for a variety of reasons. So we're cautiously optimistic over the course of this year that those will present themselves.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak: Just along the lines of that M&A, I know you mentioned you have certainly have a pipeline platform versus bolt-ons. I guess just even what you're seeing today and sort of the comments that you just made, is there any confidence sort of you'd probably lean towards more bolt-ons in the next few months? Or are there some opportunities that you're seeing on the platform side that could execute?
Neil Hunn: Yes. I think it's -- we characterize the current near-term level of activity in the M&A pipeline as having a bit more on the add-on or bolt-on side than what we might have seen historically. I wouldn't read too much into that. It sometimes -- it's just the way it falls sometimes. There's certainly a handful of platforms that we are currently evaluating. There always is a handful that we're in pretty late stages or detailed work evaluating. But on balance, there's a bit more on the bolt-on side. Those tend to be our very best deals because they are additive to strategically to one of our existing companies. There's normally some synergies that come with those -- and as we talked about in the Investor Day, strategically, we'd like to see more of our capital deployed against the bolt-on strategy. But we're not going to force it but it would be nice to be able to see it.
Allison Poliniak: Got it. That's helpful. And then Application Software, the capacity ramp in acute care. I know you mentioned, obviously, it's impacting Q2. How should we think about that, the balance of the year? When does that slowly get running, that ramp? .
Jason Conley: Yes, that's right. I mean, we thought EBITDA margins were in line with expectations in the first quarter and we did have those implementations. Also, CBORD had some large integrated security pull-ins, they finally got some parts for some of those projects. But for the second quarter, we're expecting it to be about the same and then it will pick back up in the second half. So you can expect EBITDA margins to be about flat year-over-year.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird.
Joe Vruwink: Hope you're well. One observation I just kind of what we're hearing in the broader environment. It does seem like the system of record companies for the industries you serve, they're holding up pretty well. And then I think there's some particular industry examples like K-12 education would be one where the spend is actually consolidating a bit around these companies, so share of wallet is going up right now. Do you think you're generally seeing this so far? And any examples that come to mind where you kind of look at your growth relative to underlying IT spend and this wallet share dynamic is maybe playing out?
Neil Hunn: Yes. I mean, I would say -- I mean, I have to -- we can take this off-line and sort of go company by company in some level of detail to the extent it would be interesting. But at the highest level, we would say yes, right? So we're -- we say in the Investor Day, we say in all of our communication that we're mission-critical software system of record sort of software. On the application side, if you think about like Deltek or Vertafore I mean, Frontline -- Aderant is a great example where we've gone from number 2 to number 1. We've doubled the size of the company over ownership period. The net retention has gone from like low 1-0, whatever, 102,103 so low 110s, 110, 112, I think which just gives you a sense that all these software companies work for a long time to create a customer base that then they can spend the rest of their life cross-selling into. And so most of our -- all of our companies, 50% to 75% or more of their new bookings come from cross-selling, upselling. And the best example of that is the one you called out which is Frontline which I think it's like 80% plus, where it's -- they've done all the work over their history of basically capturing the customers and now it's about how do you get more share of wallet. And in Frontline's case, in particular, it's a more fragmented state-by-state based on the regulatory environment, competitive environment. And you're right, today, 50% of K-12 health systems -- or excuse me, education systems want to buy from a consolidated vendor, where 5 years ago, that number was 25% or 30%. So the market is coming towards -- in the education space towards companies like Frontline.
Joe Vruwink: Okay, that's great. And then, I guess, a quick one on Frontline. In terms of the sequencing of free cash flow, so 50% cash flow margin business, do they typically kind of burn cash 1Q, 2Q, 3Q, 4Q? And so 3Q, we can think of more than 50% of that business's full year generation is probably hitting in that time frame.
Jason Conley: Yes, I think that's the right way to think about it, Joe. A little bit more of a burn in Q2 -- or Q1, a little less in Q2 and then a big cash inflow in Q3 and a little bit of cash in Q4.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.
Alex Blanton: Most of my questions on your operations have been answered but I wanted to ask about the -- how you benefit from the sale of compressor controls. Like Clayton Doble and Rice [ph], they sold it to Honeywell, they just announced this week for $670 million. Are they selling your piece? And do you get any cash from that?
Neil Hunn: Alex, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this. So we are certainly involved with it. We're 49% owners of Indicor. We have quarterly Board meetings. From the very first conversation we had with [indiscernible] about what the value creation plan is for Indicor, part of it was to do some portfolio work with this being the principal piece to make Indicor less oily and more industrial. And so this was a strategic -- this was an asset that was highly strategic to a number of folks in the industry. It was a very competitive process and we're delighted to be able to sell the business for 19 x this year's EBITDA. I think Honeywell is a great home for this business. That mattered a lot to us. The benefit of Indicor is we now get to take this capital as a company and a 49% owner of the company and then redeploy it to industrial and industrial tech type businesses build the M&A flywheel and hopefully create the next great industrial compounder that will become a public company in 3 to 5 years. And that's when we'll monetize through the whole value creation plan.
Alex Blanton: Okay. Do you get any cash from this deal?
Jason Conley: The only cash we get, Alex, is we'll have a distribution to us for the tax liability of the sale. But most of the cash is going to stay in the business. So we'll get that cash whenever it closes, sometime in the second half.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call .
Operator: That conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-01-27 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the fourth quarter and full year financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Incoming Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Incoming Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Unless otherwise noted, we will discuss our results and guidance on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense; a legal charge related to the settlement of the Boral versus Verathon patent litigation matter. The case related to the sale of certain Verathon products from 2004 through 2016, there are no future financial obligations for Verathon related to this matter. Next, transaction-related expenses for completed acquisitions, and lastly, we have adjusted our cash flow statement to exclude the cash taxes paid related to our divestiture activity. GAAP requires these payments to be classified as operating cash flow items even though they are related to divestitures. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. As we turn to Page 4, we'll walk through our usual year-end agenda, highlights for the most recent quarter and full year, followed by color commentary for each of our segments and then the initiation of our 2023 guidance. Let's go and get started. Next slide, please.  As we heard on Page 5, the main takeaways for today's call are First, we delivered another great year of strategic, operational and financial progress. To this end, we concluded our multiyear divestiture program, which was centered on improving the quality of remaining portfolio, namely emphasizing less cyclical, more asset-light and higher-growth businesses. In addition, we successfully deployed $4.3 billion towards market-leading and application-specific software businesses. More on this later, but we also continue to have substantial M&A firepower well north of $4 billion. Organically, we grew just shy of 10% for the year while simultaneously improving the underlying quality of the enterprise. During the course of the year, our businesses did a terrific job of innovating and capturing share, which leads us to our second main takeaway for today's call that we're well positioned for another solid year of performance in 2023. Our higher quality, less cyclical and more highly recurring nature of our portfolio will serve us well during 2023. Now as I hand the call over to our Incoming CFO, Jason Conley, let me take a moment and thank Rob Crisci for all he's done for Roper and for me. Rob has been a significant contributor to our success and an important member of our executive team with meaningful insights and contributions across a variety of topics, including our most recent portfolio repositioning.  We're excited to welcome Jason to his new role. Many of you know, Jason, for those of you who do not, Jason has been with Roper for 16 years. He started in corporate IR and FP&A, then the operating CFO at MHA or one of our businesses and most recently serving as Roper's Chief Accounting Officer.  Since he has returned to corporate, he has been a member of our capital allocation team and has attended every Board meeting. The team and I are excited to partner with Jason for the next leg of our evolution. So, with that, looking forward to the partnership, Jason, and thank you, Rob, for all of you done to make Roper better than when you joined. Jason, let me turn the call over to you, can walk through the fourth quarter and the full year financial summary. Jason?
Jason Conley: Thanks, Neil. I am very excited and incredibly grateful for the opportunity to work with you and the team in this new role. And of course, thanks, Rob, for your awesome partnership and mentorship over the years. It's been just a great experience working together.  So first, I'd like to introduce Brandon Cross as our new Principal Accounting Officer. Brandon joined Roper about five years ago, progressing to our Assistant Controller and more recently, has led and transformed our audit services function. He has significant M&A and integration experience. So this is a natural and well-earned promotion for him. Brandon, I look forward to working together in your new role.
Brandon Cross: Thanks, Jason.
Jason Conley: If you indulge me, I'll rip on Roper for a few seconds. I've been blessed to help guide and execute our evolution from Roper Industries to Roper Technologies, which has been underpinned by our North Star belief that cash is the best measure of performance. And as we enter 2023, our best years are ahead of us. We have a family of market-leading businesses with durable growth drivers and terrific free cash flow margins. Further, the leadership teams and talent processes at our businesses are the best in the company's history. And finally, we have significant capacity to execute our proven and disciplined M&A strategy that I've been a part of for many years. I anticipate being quite active on the road this year. So for those on the call, I look forward to either meeting you or reconnecting in the coming months. All right. Let's get into the financials. Turning to Slide 6. We'll do a quick review of our Q4 performance. We capped off a solid year of growth with revenue of over $1.4 billion, which was 14% higher over prior year. Organic growth was 7% with strength across the portfolio, which was enhanced by 10% software recurring revenue growth. Acquisitions added eight points of growth, led by our Frontline business that closed in early October, and currency was a two-point headwind. EBITDA of $592 million, was up 17% over the prior year. We experienced strong operating leverage across the enterprise and improving gross margins in our TEP segment to finish out the year. DEPS came in at $3.92, which was 17% against prior year and $0.18 above the midpoint of our guidance range.  Next, we'll look at free cash flow. free cash flow. Free cash flow of $457 million was down 8% over the prior year. Excluding the Section 174 impact, we were down 3%. And factoring out a $30 million Vertafore tax benefit in 2021 that doesn't repeat, we're up about 3% to 4% in the quarter. Taking a broader view, you can see we compounded cash 11% over a four-year period, despite the Section 174 headwind, and we're well positioned for double-digit cash flow compounding going forward. Turning to Slide 7. We'll now do a quick overview of our Q4 segment results, as Neil will unpack more detail on the full year a bit later. We had a nice finish to a great year across the three segments. For Application Software, revenue was up 22% to $740 million, with organic growth of 7%. EBITDA margin increased to 45.6% in the quarter. We had strong SaaS bookings growth and overall solid net retention throughout the year, which is just naturally rolling through recurring revenue in the quarter. Growth was broad-based across the segment, aside from some delayed decision-making in the large government contract in space within Deltek. On margin, we had lower incentive-based SG&A and employee medical costs, so some favorability in the quarter. If you look at the full year margin of 44%, that's about where we would expect to be over a longer horizon. Our Network Software segment grew nicely in the quarter, with revenue up 9% to $350 million and EBITDA also up 9% to $189 million or 54% of revenue. Growth was led by our freight matching businesses, which continued driving higher ARPU from premium offerings to offset moderating carry activity as we expected.  Tech-enabled products revenue was $340 million and grew 5% organically in the quarter. Demand remained strong, and we had some orders that didn't get delivered toward the end of the quarter, which will benefit Q1. EBITDA grew 7% to $119 million, resulting in EBITDA margin of 34.9% or 100 basis points over prior year, with strong operating leverage as the price cost dynamic was neutralized in the quarter. Turning to the full year 2022 performance on Slide 8. Revenue was 11% higher than prior year to $5.4 billion, with 9% organic growth. EBITDA was 12% better to nearly $2.2 billion, with EBITDA margin coming in at 40.4%. The of $14.28, was 15% over prior year and reflected strong P&L leverage against the 11% revenue growth. Notably, compared to our 2018 pre-divestiture financial profile, our revenue is about $175 million higher, while EBITDA is nearly $365 million higher. So, through a combination of organic growth and capital deployment, we've grown despite divesting about 40% of our 2018 revenue. And most importantly, the composition of our portfolio today positions us for higher and more durable growth going forward.  Free cash flow came in at about $1.5 billion, so down 7% versus prior year. It's a bit of the same situation as our fourth quarter with both the 2022 headwinds of Section 174 of nearly $100 million and the nonrepeating of the 2021 Vertafore tax benefit of $117 million. If we normalize for those items, free cash flow grew about 8%. We've had a bit of an inventory build within our tech segment as supply has become more available. This is not a new normal, and we certainly expect that to improve in 2023.  If we kind of take this up to a multiyear view, you can see we've compounded cash at 15% over a four-year period. And as we look forward, the impact from Section 174 will be fairly neutral, and we expect to convert plus or minus 80% of flow. So, we're clearly well positioned for double-digit growth. Turning to Slide 9. Let's take a look at our financial position. We certainly had a lot going on in Q4. On November 22, we completed the majority sale of our industrial businesses, which are now operating under the name Indicor and received $2.6 billion in upfront proceeds. Also, in the quarter, we paid $270 million, representing all taxes due related to the majority sale. So, this yielded us net proceeds of over $2.3 billion, a very good outcome here indeed. Related to our stake in Indicor, this is now appearing as an equity investment on our balance sheet. We will be updating the fair value of the equity investment each quarter going forward. To provide a clearer picture of our continuing operations, we will provide a non-GAAP adjustment for this fair value accounting and any tax expense related to this investment.  So just looking at our balance sheet, even after our $3.7 billion Frontline acquisition, which was completed in October, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 2.7 times. So, our solid leverage profile, coupled with strong free cash flow generation and an undrawn revolver of $3.5 billion, gives us $4 billion plus of M&A capacity. Clearly, we are very well positioned for disciplined capital deployment in 2023.  And with that, I will turn the call back over to Neil to go through our segment details. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Jason, and well done. Let's turn to Page 11 and walk through our 2022 highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $2.64 billion, up 7% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were 44.1%. Performance across this segment was just solid in 2022.  Vertafore, our software business that tech enables property and casualty insurance agencies accelerated their growth, led by continued strength in their enterprise class segment. In addition, the two Vertafore bolt-on acquisitions are strategically on point, integrated and performing well. As we've been discussing, SaaS migrations have been a key theme for us over the past few years, and 2022 was no different. Both Aderant and Deltek continued their SaaS migration momentum and both grew nicely based on solid customer adds and strong retention. Deltek was particularly strong in their private sector end markets. But as Jason mentioned, Deltek did see some slower decision-making specific to new bookings in the enterprise segment for their GovCon solutions. At our upcoming March 21 Investor Day, you'll get an opportunity to hear directly from the leaders at Vertafore, Deltek and Aderant about how they're competing and consistently winning in the market. As it relates to Power Plant, we liked what we saw last year. PowerPlan was strong given their refocused and narrowed strategy combined with a highly aligned team. As a result, PowerPlan crossed a meaningful milestone, launching a SaaS solution for their flagship product, tax fixed assets. Congrats to the team for a great 2022 and looking forward to more great things in 2023. 2022 is a very good year for application health care IT businesses as well. Strata's combination with EPSI has just been great. The integration is complete and the number of EPSI, the Strata has conversions and upsell, cross-sell are both meaningfully ahead of our deal expectations.  Clinisys and Data Innovations continue to win in the marketplace. The internal combination of Clinisys and Sunquest has rejuvenated and energized their high-performance culture, which is enabling the business to more effectively compete and win in the marketplace. Data Innovations continues to gain share and evolve to become the de facto standard as it relates to Lab Middleware. Finally, Frontline, our cornerstone 2022 acquisition is off to a solid start. We look forward to sharing the strategic and financial success of this business in the quarters and years to come.  I'd like to reiterate with what we started with. Performance here strategically, operationally and financially was just great in 2022. Very proud of the team and the performance. Congrats and thanks. Looking to the outlook for 2023, we expect to see organic growth in the mid-single-digit area based on our market positions and growth in recurring revenues.  Turning to Page 12. Revenues in 2022 for our Network Software segment were $1.38 billion, up 13% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were strong at 53.3%. As we dig into business-specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses were great in 2022.  Their exceptional growth is based on many factors, certainly favorable market conditions, but also continued product and network innovations as well as terrific product and package designs that drove increased value for the network participants. iPipeline and iTrade network were stellar performers throughout 2022 and benefited from having strong renewal and expansion activity. iPipeline like that a PowerPlan is benefiting from having a narrowed and more focused strategy, namely tech-enabling the life insurance and annuity distribution network. Moving to Foundry, which had another great year as part of Roper. Foundry continues to be the market-leading software in postproduction media entertainment. During 2022, Foundry's product innovations were impressive with several new features focused on ML-based automation. Starting in 2023, Foundry's flagship product Nuke will begin its subscription transition, so looking forward for solid progress on that front. Growth in our businesses that focus on alternate site health care was led by SHP and SoftWriters and importantly, retention rates across SHP, SoftWriters and MHA remained extremely high. Broadly, the performance across this segment was great. Congrats to the teams for this terrific year of financial performance. Turning to the outlook for 2023. We expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment based on broad and sustained growth across the group and a normalization of market conditions for freight and logistics applications. As we turn to Page 13, revenues in 2022 for our Tech-enabled Products segment were $1.35 billion, up 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for this segment were 35.4% for the year. As expected, EBITDA margins expanded in the second half of the year as pricing and supply chain improvements flow through.  Let's start with Neptune, our water meter and technology product business. This past year was just terrific with very strong growth based on strong margin conditions, strong share gains and strong adoption of their static ultrasonic meter technology. In addition, Neptune launched their cellular connectivity solution and did a fantastic job migrating a large chunk of their customer base to their newest data management solution. Spectacular job Neptune, congrats you and your team.  Northern Digital, which is our precision measurement tech company, continued to see terrific demand for their optical and EM solutions. NDI benefits from having a strategy that is laser-focused on health care applications and an R&D capability that is unmatched in the industry. NDI's core tech is using countless life-saving procedures on a daily basis across the globe. Verathon turned in another solid year performance in 2022 as well. The growth is based on momentum across their video innovation and single-use bronchoscope product lines. As you saw in the press release, we did take the opportunity to clean up a legacy patent dispute. Make no mistake, the innovation capability at Verathon is nothing short of exceptional, and we cannot be more confident about their most recent product launches and the new concepts in the development pipeline. As it relates to the single-use rock space, we hope to see Verathon capture the number one market position in North America in 2023. Our outlook for the year in this segment is in the high single-digit area and is based on continued strength in backlog at Neptune as well as continued growth across our medical product businesses.  Specific to the first quarter, we do have easier comps versus a year ago. Now please turn to Page 15, and let's review our 2023 and Q1 guidance. For 2023, we're initiating our DEPS guidance to be in the range of $15.90 and $16.20. Underpinning this guidance is expected organic growth of 5% to 6% and a tax rate in the 21% to 22% area. Specific to the first quarter, we're establishing our DEPS guidance to be in the $3.80 to $3.84 range.  Now please turn with us to our final page, Page 16. As we turn to this page, we want to leave you with the same key points with which we started. First, 2022 was a year of great accomplishment for our teams and our enterprise. We grew revenue 11%, 9% on an organic basis. And we did this while continuing to increase the underlying quality of our revenue base. In fact, we delivered double-digit increases in our Software organic recurring revenue during 2022. EBITDA grew 12%. Our EBITDA margins expanded 20 basis points to 40.4%. Also, we successfully concluded our multiyear divestiture program and deployed $4.3 billion against our long-standing capital deployment strategy, headlined by Frontline Education.  The second key takeaway is that we're well positioned for double-digit cash flow compounding in 2023 based on our organic revenue growth outlook, contributions from our 2022 acquisition cohort and having well north of $4 billion of M&A capacity. To this end, we continue to be very active in the M&A markets. But as you saw during 2022 and as always, we will remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital.  Finally, and perhaps the most important, the new higher quality Roper portfolio is becoming increasingly more evident, and we've never been more excited about the future of enterprise. As we open up to your questions, we'd like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that we're hosting an Investor Day on Tuesday, March 21, in New York. We look forward to seeing many of you there.  So with that, let’s open it up to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just start with the best wishes to Rob. I remember when he was a starting as a rookie Investor Relations professional and just wish him all the best. Thank you.
Robert Crisci: Thank you, Deane, I appreciate it. It's been a great decade.
Deane Dray: It's fabulous. And then, Jason, I think you've been on every one of our callbacks for the 16 years. So you're absolutely -- we know exactly who you are and your experience. And so congrats on the new role.
Jason Conley: Thanks, Deane. Appreciated. 
Deane Dray: All right. So for a question, maybe we can start with a bit of a macroeconomic sensitivity because you typically, you don't see much of this within Roper, but just called out the Deltek delayed decision-making, Neil, is there any change in the pace of like new customer adds or the migration, new logos? Anything that you would point to that perhaps there is some economic sensitivity reading through in that kind of the pace of business?
Neil Hunn: Yes. I think the -- if I take it at the highest level, we've been 8% to 10% organic. The last couple of years, obviously, are guiding a little bit below that for 2023. So I think you see it in our guidance model reading through as a general matter. If you take the Software businesses, our retention rates will stay very high. We expect that as to the intimacy and the criticality of our applications. So retention rates to be very high. But as our customers, I mean, across all these end markets, I mean, if there's macroeconomic sort of headwinds or slowdown, then they're going to be affected to some degree, so we expect customer expansion activity maybe a little bit of net new to be slowed a little bit. The Software businesses will be great. They'll grow for sure, but a little bit slower. From an end market perspective, we're in a number of end markets that are generally macro insensitive. There's a little bit, obviously, in our transportation business is that we called out on the call. That will be a little bit slower. But there's some hedges inside the portfolio. ConstructConnect should be good in the slower economic environment and also our medical product businesses as staffing levels and hospitals gets a little bit easier. Patient volume should come back and that should help those businesses. And then from a product, Neptune has got a gigantic amount of backlog, which will carry them through much of this year. So we feel pretty well set up. It doesn't mean that we're completely insensitive to macro, but relatively insensitive.
Deane Dray: That's real helpful. And then let's just switch over to free cash flow and maybe I'll be accused of quibbling. The $161 million free cash flow conversion is still elite, but it did lag your five-year average. And I know there's some dynamics here, and you touched on them in the remarks, the Section 174 and the comparison from the tax benefit last year. Anything that on the working capital side or maybe the Frontline contribution because they're on a different school year, so maybe more of a third quarter collection. But is there any change in the seasonal tilt on free cash flow conversion?
Robert Crisci: Yes, Deane, good question. I think you're spot on. So we typically convert on -- from an EBITDA to free cash flow will be in the 90s typically and Section 174. If we adjust for that, we are in the 80s. And so you're right. Frontline has a very seasonal sort of cash collection cadence. So the third quarters when all the renewals and upsells happen, so most of their cash comes in the third quarter. So in the fourth, you won't see that converting to cash from EBITDA. So that's exactly what you saw. So we're looking forward to next year and especially in the third quarter will be a little bit more weighted than normal.
Deane Dray: That’s great. That’s exactly what we’re looking for. Thanks. 
Operator: Our next question today comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please go ahead. 
Scott Davis: Good morning, guys. Congrats, Rob, and good luck, Jason, et cetera. I wish you guys well, but [indiscernible]. Jason you get to work a few more years with Neil. Good luck.
Jason Conley: Fair enough. 
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Scott Davis: I can say that, I guess. But anyways, I don't want to climb in a minutia here, but I know there's no one particular asset that moves the needle in a huge way. But can we walk back and talk a little bit about PowerPlan? I mean you mentioned the narrower product focus. I think, I heard you say, which didn't really understand what that meant. And the cloud rollout, again, like is that -- how relevant is that to the business? And -- but maybe if we just go back and you can explain to us again what kind of drives PowerPlan? And I'll just leave it there and leave it behind. 
Neil Hunn: I appreciate the opportunity to talk about, anyway our businesses, it's been a while since we've been able to do a double-click on PowerPlan. So just remind you what they do, right? So PowerPlan software and services live at the intersection of the financial system and the asset tracking system for these large utilities, investor-owned and public utilities. And when the PowerPlan software has a perfectly curated view of what the assets look like inside our customer base. When you have that perfectly curated view and these assets are constantly being updated and changed, they're not static, right? And so that's why you have to live between these two systems. And we have this perfectly curated view of what the assets are, then you get the most appropriate tax treatment you can, the most appropriate lease accounting and a series of other financial benefits associated with that. We bought the business. The business was doing that, but it was also reaching outside its core customer base and the core products I just described, looking for growth sort of in all the wrong places, if you will. And then we -- what we did when we did our strategy work with them going back probably a year, 1.5 years ago is the amount of opportunity inside the core of what they do was large enough to support the growth thesis for many years to come. So it's just refocusing back on the core. That's a common theme. We talked about that. I think you'll see that increasingly more inside of Ropers as we do our strategy work, right? So not getting too far away from the core and getting distracted. So that's what they've done. The first impact of that is they now have this 100% SaaS solution for their principal product fixed assets just released in Q4. And we're excited by that because as you lift and shift your customer base from an on-premise to a cloud solution, there's a tremendous value capture opportunity, and it will unlock some growth for the business.
Scott Davis: And can you get pricing in the process? Or is this just more about retention?
Neil Hunn: No, that's the value unlock, right? So we're doing more for our customers with the SaaS solution, right? So we're not just hosting it. There's more features. You're on the latest release, where certainly, we know how to operate our software ourselves better than third parties. And so it's the efficiency and the uptime is higher. And as a result of all that, you do get price. We'll see we talked about there's roughly $900 million in legacy on-premise maintenance in our revenue base. And as that is lifting and shifting to the cloud over a long arc of time, that should lift and shift north of 2 times, right? So there's $1 billion of growth that's latent inside the portfolio as we lift and shift that on-premise maintenance to the cloud.
Scott Davis: Okay. I look forward to the Analyst Day. I'm going to pass it on. Thanks, guys. Congrats on another good year. See you on Analyst Day. 
Operator: And our next question today comes from Julian Mitchell at Barclays.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Thank you, Rob. And I look forward to working with you, Jason. So maybe my first question, just to try and home in a little bit more on the sort of macro framework in the guide. Maybe specifically, I think about 25% of your Software revenue is reoccurring and non-recurring, so maybe more cyclical kind of talk. Maybe just remind us sort of what the organic growth of those two in aggregate was last year and what you're dialing in for 2023 or any flavor of that? And then within Network Software specifically, transport and freight, it's almost 1.25 of the revenue. And you mentioned you're dialing in, I think, normalization was your phrase. Maybe just any finer point on what that means exactly of growth this year versus last?
Neil Hunn: Yes. So let me take -- let's take those, Jason, I take those in sequence. So I'll set up what the difference between recurring and reoccurring revenue is in our base. I'll let Jason talk about the relative growth rate, then we'll tackle the DAT freight question you're raising.  So just to level set what everybody is, if we have a recurring revenue is subscription, contractual recurring revenue, reoccurring revenue is principally located at our MHA business. We take a percentage of the drug and food spend that goes to the network and so it's not technically recurring, it's highly reoccurring. So it's not -- and that's probably the most -- one of the most stable parts of our portfolio, long-term care, health care, residents and buildings, consuming food and pharmaceuticals, right? So it's highly secure for lack of a better word. It's not transactional relative to a macroeconomic sort of situation. So I'll stop just in terms of framing recurring versus reoccurring. I'll let Jason take the relative growth rate question.
Jason Conley: Yes, sure, glad to. So MHA, as Neil mentioned, it's really about drug purchases from the pharmacies, and they have very strong retention in those businesses from a customer standpoint. We always sort of think about the business being at the -- maybe at the bottom end of the mid-single digits, maybe a little bit low singles. And that's sort of what we experienced this year, and that's kind of what we're baking in for next year.
Neil Hunn: Great. Okay. Now let's take to your freight and logistics around DAT specifically. So to remind you, there's this tension between the cyclical freight dynamic and a secular push or a secular benefit that DAT and DAT's customers are experiencing relative to the spot market becoming a more efficient place to place freight. So there's tension between those two.  From a cyclical point of view, we expected and have seen the carrier side of the network reduce a little bit. And it's -- and we expect it to reduce over the course or shrink or get a little bit smaller over the course of this year. DAT grew through the 2019 freight recession. I think DAT has grown every year since 2010. So the business is talking about the rate of growth at DAT, not does it expand and contract. It tends to be much more stickier than that. As an early read, January is actually a little bit better. I mean the number of carriers in the network is sort of flattish through January and not declining. And the people in the industry that sort of call like the freight timing and if there's going to be a freight recession, I actually think there's a queuing for a large spring shipping season, mostly around -- this triggered by produce. And we might start to be seeing a little bit of that bleed in, but we'll have to see how the next couple of quarters play out.
Julian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Thank you for the color. And then just within TEP, I understand the recurring piece is minimal there in its 99% product-related. Any flavor you'd give us on the sort of what you're seeing in medical versus Neptune for 2023, any major difference in kind of visibility between the 2two or the growth rate expected?
Neil Hunn: Yes. So we have the most visibility we've ever had at Neptune. That's right. The order volume continues to flow. The order duration, meaning the longer date orders continues to flow. And so we feel quite comfortable and good how 2023 is shaping for Neptune.  For medical products, there's actually -- I think we've talked about a few quarters ago, the reoccurring elements of Verathon became the largest part of the revenue stream. There's a lot of consumable pull-through in the capital equipment there. Northern Digital has a decently high amount of consumables that are pulled through that zip code [ph]. And so it is more procedure and patient driven. And we like I said a few minutes ago, we feel that were decently well set up there, but it's not in our base case.  So we saw 6% to 8% declines in patient volumes in the areas in which we service in 2022, all tied to hospital staffing levels. And we're cautiously optimistic that as the labor market solution, hospitals be able to staff and be able to see patient volumes pick back up the prior levels.
Julian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Steve Tusa at JPMorgan. Please go ahead. 
Steve Tusa: Good morning. Congrats to all. Rob and Jason, I'm looking forward to working with you. Just on the free cash, you mentioned plus or minus 80% conversion to EBITDA. Obviously, the last couple of years have been a bit volatile around all these tax items. But in '21, I think you had a decent number of deferred revenue benefit on the cash flow statement. Maybe just give us a little bit of color looking into next year with concerns around the macro that can be a pretty big variable. I mean are you going to be around that 80% in '23? Or will you be kind of more in between what you did in '21 and '22, I think, adjusted around 70%? Maybe just a bit of color on the free cash, and then I have a follow-up on Frontline.
Jason Conley: Yes, happy to. No, I think we're feeling very good about the 80% Our deferred revenue, our renewals were really strong this quarter, and we felt good how it moved up sequentially, how was up year-over-year. And just what we're hearing from our businesses, we feel good about the renewals. And then we're going to have -- we expect -- I think I said on the call that we'll get some improvement on our inventory ratios next year. We had a little bit of build at the end of this year. Frontline will certainly help with our negative working capital profile. They're at negative 40%. Like I said, most of that will hit in the third quarter when all the renewals take place. Of course, if Section 174 gets repealed, this will be a home run year, but we're not banking on that for now.
Steve Tusa: So like something in the $1.8 billion range for free cash for next year?
Jason Conley: I'll let you come to your math on that.
Neil Hunn: Okay. We will.
Steve Tusa: And then just Frontline, revenues roughly $95 million this quarter. Is that about right?
Jason Conley: No. They were somewhere in the '80s. We had a few days knocked off at the beginning of the quarter because we closed on the 4th.
Steve Tusa: Okay. By the way, I really appreciate all the discussion on the businesses and looking forward to the Investor Day, learning more on this portfolio. So very helpful detail on the moving parts of all the different businesses.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. 
Allison Poliniak: Good morning. Just want to circle back on DAT. I know you talked about it growing historically through cycles, but it's certainly been an unusual one. A lot of new entrants here. Is there any risk to the retention rate should that spot rate not hold in terms of stabilization in some of those new entrants, I guess, can't survive? And then I guess along with that, that premium offering, in this type of uncertainty, does that drive maybe more increase or interest in that premium offering versus just to gain some visibility here in an uncertain market? Just any thoughts there?
Neil Hunn: Yes. So in terms of the number of -- when you say new entrants, I assume you're referring to the number of new carriers that are in the network as opposed to a competitive entry or the sort because there really are no new competitive entrants. Relative to the carriers, yes, I mean, it was -- it's been just a tremendous last couple of years, driven by the things we've talked about for a couple of years, which is the fluidity and the liquidity in the spot market, which is a secular tailwind and then obviously, a huge boom on the cyclical piece. We -- historically, when you look at like peak carriers to trough carriers through cycle, it sort of goes carriers declines by plus or minus 10%. We've assumed that it will decline by more than that in our guidance model because the buildup was unprecedented. But -- so that's sort of -- we think we have this conservatively planned in our outlook, but it's unprecedented ramp up leading up to this. We do take some early confidence in the carrier count in the first couple of weeks of January. So the fact that we're flattish versus continuing to see some declines is certainly encouraging, but it's only a handful of data points we want to see take together. In terms of the premium offering, I mean, DAT has just done a tremendous job creating product and package designs that have more value for all the network participants. It's helped drive some ARPU increases because there's more value that the participants are getting.
Jason Conley: So different packages, different features and functionality that they've upsold.
Neil Hunn: That's right.
Allison Poliniak: Great. No, that's helpful. And then just in terms of the M&A pipeline, are you still under the new portfolio, PE primarily your source of opportunities here? Have you expanded it? And if I guess if you have, are you looking -- I know CRI is your metric that is your foundation. But are you providing any other controls with maybe some new opportunities out there? Just any thoughts there?
Neil Hunn: Yes. You're right. We've obviously historically sourced all. But in my time here, I think one meaningful deal from private equity. One was from a small founder or founder, and that has been sort of the pod in which we fish. But we're -- that's not exclusively where we have business development activities going on. We've always looked in public markets. We just haven't found anything that's been compelling from a value point of view yet. We'll continue to look there. You could see us get a little bit earlier in the cycle and try to compete a little bit more with private equity sort of half a click earlier in the company's life cycle. So when we did the Vertafore transaction and the Frontline transaction, many of our investors said, why didn't you buy it when the first you bought it from a private equity firm, you bought it from bought it. And so that's something that you could see us explore in the right situations. But still, all that being said, the predominance of what we're going to do is what we've done for the last 20 years, which is sort of lower risk of highly recurring software -- application software businesses from private equity.
Allison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Brent Hewitt with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. 
Brent Hewitt : Hi, thank you. And good morning. You noted that your adjusted EPS calculation will include the fair value accounting and tax impact of Indicor. But why would you not include the minority interest contribution as well? Just wondering what is the logical downside not including that, shouldn't it be a positive and growing contribution?
Jason Conley: Well, it's a calculation that's going to be based on many variables, right? It's mainly an accounting exercise. We don't think that it's going to -- we'd rather see the outcome when we do the exit. We think that's the better reflection of what the economics are going to be. We feel really good about what that's going to look like. We've worked with CD&R on a strategy there. They typically look at several multiples of return on investment, and that's what we're playing for upon exit.
Brent Hewitt: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then in terms of price contribution in Q4, what did that look like? And then also how much pricing is embedded in your 2023 guidance?
Neil Hunn: So price for us, I mean, it's an important lever to our growth algorithm, not just for '22 and '23, but all prior years and all forward years. Teasing out specifically how much is price is a very, very difficult thing across our 27 companies and rolling it up to a number that is meaningful. And so we're not going to share a specific number in that regard. I'll tell you the pricing, the value capture that we have, given what we do, the criticality of what we do, we've always had pricing power and pricing value capture and there's nothing different with that. Do you want to add anything to that, Jason? Perhaps, we go to the next question?
Operator: Our next question today comes from Brendan Luke with Bernstein. Please go ahead. 
Brendan Luke: Good morning. Just wanted to take a quick look at macro, question here. I was wondering if you could offer any color on your exposure to construction end markets? And how that's playing into your growth expectations for FY '23. And I guess, specifically, I'd be curious around Deltek, ConstructConnect and Neptune as well.
Neil Hunn: Yes. So I appreciate the opportunity there. So let's just take it by those three. So ConstructConnect, to remind you what it is, right, so we have a near perfect database of all the construction -- commercial construction projects that are in the planning phase across North America. As a result, when -- it has a bit of countercyclical demand attached to it. So when there is a tremendous amount of new projects and you're a subcontractor general contract and building product manufacturing and business is flowing from everywhere, then you don't have to look too hard for what you're going to do next. When there's fewer projects, then you subscribe to the subscription service of ConstructConnect so you can identify what projects are coming down the pipe that you want to try to bid for and win. And so the ConstructConnect has been a modestly good performer for us over the years. We expect it to actually have a good run here in '23 as a result. Deltek does have -- it's been a strategic focus of Deltek. Deltek is 60% government contracting, 40% private sector and private sector. The smallest sliver is construction and we sell software to large contractors. That's what we do. That business, we -- in our prepared comments, we talked about how the private sector was very strong in Q4 for Deltek. We would expect and do anticipate some softening on the construction side for Deltek in 2023, and we think we have that fully covered in our guidance. And then Neptune, we believe strongly Neptune is not a cyclical business. As you sell water meters and water meter technology to the municipalities when they're -- they tend to have a budget for meters. When there is a large new residential new construction, then a higher percentage of the budget goes to install new meters. When there's fewer new starts, the budget stays the same, but they take the meters and they do the retrofits and trade outs of the aging fleet and infrastructure. So that is a general cross-cycle sort of view of Neptune, But then we're further -- our confidence is further buoyed by the fact that we have this just unprecedented amount of backlog at Neptune for 2023. So we think that Neptune will perform well for us this year.
Brendan Luke: Very useful. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Rob Mason at Baird. Please go ahead. 
RobMason: Yes, good morning. And congrats as well to Jason and Rob. Maybe just stick on the technology-enabled products area. I think the -- there was a mention of some products didn't ship in the quarter maybe got pushed. Just to step back, maybe update us where you think you are around supply chain just on the product side in your businesses? And then I'm curious what kind of impact that those deferral shipments might have had in the fourth quarter?
Neil Hunn: Let me just set it up, and I'll hand it over to Jason. So in TEP, we talk obviously -- about Neptune, we talk about medical process. There's also a small cohort of RF product businesses [indiscernible] and RF Ideas. The fourth quarter was particularly brutal supply chain wise on those RF product businesses. And so with that, I'll give it to Jason to sort of talk through anything you'd like to.
Jason Conley: Yes. It wasn't significant. It was probably in the $5 million to $10 million range, and it was across a number of businesses. So I think we expect the first quarter for TEP to be up a little bit more than the rest of the year because of that and because of some of the easier comps. So maybe low double digits in the first quarter, but that's sort of the range. So yes, a lot of this is in the rearview. Of course, things do pop up here and there, but we're not hearing as much sort of meaningful impact in the quarters.
Neil Hunn: And as a general matter, we're not the only ones that. But supply chain is generally, as Jason just said, improving and there's essentially the chip shortage and chip issues. There's more of a globally is just -- but we're not -- you're not just hearing that from us. We do think this -- the supply chain issues abate over '23.
Rob Mason: Sure, sure. Neil, you've made several references to Neptune through the call and share gains and the strength in your backlog. And that tends to be a business where share doesn't move around that dramatically. I'm just -- could you expound a little bit just on how what's going on there? What you've done, whether it relates to ultrasonic adoption or the introduction of cellular? Or is this a broader effort at Neptune that's driving that?
Neil Hunn: Neptune has been just a steady and consistent share gainer made the whole time I've been here, right? I mean, for a decade. And the reasons for that are manifold, but they have a product orientation that starts with, they never want to strand their existing customers with technology. So for instance, this goes back to the prior iteration of communication software, but the proprietary protocols between mobile and fixed point, Neptune has a solution where if you're a municipality and you can have one fixed point, roaming points and still have some manual reads and the master data management software package in Neptune can ingest all that data and you don't strand a customer having to pick piece of technology for the totality of what they have to do. So it comes from a product orientation that starts with flexibility.  The second thing is the products are just well thought out for the long arc of what the customer wants to do. For instance, on the large commercial meters for ultrasonic, you have to be able to read high flow and low flow equally accurate our products do that. So think about a big hotel application, a trickle that happened 3 in the morning versus the high flow takes their showers in the morning, our ultrasonic meter will perfectly read the low flow and the high flow and the competitive products have to tend to be focused on one or the other for the precision. More so for that application when the ultrasonic -- the battery that drives the ultrasonic technology needs to be replaced. In our case, it's essentially a drop in battery, the competitors you have to cut the meter out and replace the meter. So it's small things -- it's seemingly small things like that, that help drive market share gains over a long arc of time.  Final thing I would say, in 2022, it was particularly beneficial for us because we had product availability throughout the totality of the year. And so some of our competitors were quoting year plus lead times. I think our lead times went from like 8 to 12 weeks. And so just some accounts that we typically have not had any presence in, they need meters, we can deliver meters, all of a sudden, you have presence and the opportunity to compete in that account. So that's helped gain some market share in the relative short term.
Rob Mason: Great. That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Alex Blanton Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please go ahead. 
AlexBlanton: Thank you. Good morning. First, I just want to say that I think your format for the slide presentation this time is probably the best ever. And I think you should stick with it. It's really a great presentation.
Neil Hunn: Noted.
Alex Blanton: Now most of my questions have been answered, but something came up from one of the other participants regarding the business that accumulates commercial construction plans. And Barry Sternick, who's the CEO of Starwood was on CNBC yesterday, saying that in his business and across the board really in commercial construction, as interest rates have gone up, people will complete the projects they have, but hold off on starting new ones. And so that's why he's looking for a big drop in commercial construction in the second half of this year because new projects are sliding. Do you see that in your statistics?
Neil Hunn: So it's interesting. So I can add Zach -- ConstructConnect publishes, look at that quarterly, quarterly the macro of what they're seeing from a construction planning point of view, and I can have Zack for that to you. I have not read the -- personally, I've not read the most recent report yet, so I don't want to comment on its content, but we can send that to you.
Alex Blanton: Okay. Because it would seem that if new construction projects are not being put into implementation, it would show up in those numbers, wouldn't it?
Neil Hunn: So here's the countercyclical nature of that. And so if you have several hundred thousand construction workers, construction, small subcontracting firms ConstructConnect has tens of thousands of customers. So as those hundreds of thousands are looking for work, it only takes a small percentage of that cohort to become a customer of ours to exhibit countercyclical growth behavior, which is what's happened in every prior slowdown in the history that we've been able to observe with ConstructConnect.
Alex Blanton: Okay. So you're really talking about your business and market share rather than the overall trend of that market.
Neil Hunn: Correct.
Alex Blanton: Yes. Okay, thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we hope to see you all at our Investor Day on March 21 in New York.
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-26 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded and all participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the third quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Unless otherwise noted, we will discuss our results and guidance on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense; transaction related expenses for completed acquisitions; and lastly we have adjusted our cash flow statement to exclude the cash taxes paid related to our divestiture activities. GAAP requires these payments to be classified as operating cash flow items even though they are related to divestitures. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Zack, and good morning everyone. As we turn to Page 4, we'll walk through our usual agenda highlights for the most recent quarter followed by color commentary for each of our segments and ending with our increased outlook for the year. Let's go ahead and get started. Next slide please. As we turn to Page 5, the main takeaways for today's call are, first, we had another great quarter of operational and financial performance and we're further increasing our outlook for the year. Second, earlier this month, we acquired another leading niche software business, Frontline Education. Third, we continue to have substantial M&A firepower north of $4 billion. And fourth and perhaps the most important the new higher quality Roper portfolio is becoming increasingly more evident, and we've never been more excited about our future. As it relates to the operating and financial performance in the quarter, we're pleased that revenues grew 10% on an organic basis and that the strength was broad based across our three segments and that margin performance improved as well. Consistent with our commentary during the last several quarters, not only did we grow nicely in the quarter, but the quality of our underlying business also improved as we saw our software recurring revenue base grow 11% on an organic basis, more on Frontline in a moment. Based on the strength in Q3 and our expectations for Q4, we're increasing our organic growth outlook to north of 9% for the year. And for those reasons together with the addition of Frontline, we're increasing our full year DEPS guidance by $0.57 at the midpoint. And finally, we've been active in the M&A market. Over the last few months, we deployed just over $4 billion, $3.7 billion for Frontline and $300 million for two bolt-ons: one for Deltek and the other for Aderant. To this end, even after our reset $4 billion in capital deployment, we still have a large amount of available M&A Firepower, over $4 billion. We continue to be very active in the M&A markets, but as you saw in Q3 and as always, we will remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital. Finally, we feel great about the improving quality of the portfolio and the associate financial and operating results. All of this is made possible by our incredibly committed and passionate teams and associates. Thank you to everyone. Turning to the next page. As previously announced, we're excited to introduce to you another niche application software leader, which we've added to the Roper portfolio, Frontline Education. Of note, we closed this transaction on October 4th. Frontline is a leading provider of SaaS software solutions targeted to the U.S. K-12 education market. Frontline is an exceptional business, which not surprisingly meets all our acquisition criteria, including being the clear leader that delivers administrative and HCM solutions purpose built for the K-12 market, having multiple durable growth drivers and a high single digit organic growth outlook, high recurring revenue north of 90%, great casual characteristics and a passionate high quality team. While early days, we're delighted to welcome Frontline to the Roper family, where we will be their permanent home going forward. This is just another great fit relative to our capital deployment and corporate strategy, not only to increase the scale of our enterprise, but the quality as well. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 7, we want to take a moment and highlight the recent transformation of Roper and our higher quality portfolio. To that end, the vast majority of our 27 businesses save for their smaller size could be a highly successful standalone leading vertical software or tech enabled product company. Each of our 27 businesses are leaders in their respective niche markets. Our businesses serve the mission critical needs of our customers and have intimate relationships with them. Our market leadership purpose-built software solutions and customer intimacy are the basis for our long-term competitive advantage. Next is our higher level of organic growth. This is no accident. We have raised the performance expectation for each of our businesses to structurally improve their long-term organic growth capabilities. We're doing this in a balance sheet and margin friendly way. A large component of the organic growth story is a higher level of recurring revenue within each of our companies, approaching 60% for the enterprise and about 75% for our software businesses. In addition, our businesses are blessed with business models that generate high levels of free cash flow, a result of their operational efficiency, margin levels and customer prepaid orientation of their balance sheets. Today, our portfolio is 75% software and 25% medical and water products. We are meaningfully less cyclical today versus 2018 given the markets we serve, healthcare, legal, education, government contracting, utilities and food to name some of our larger ones and our fixed subscription versus volume-based revenue model. To put today's portfolio in perspective, in 2018 roughly 40% of our company was either highly cyclical or project-oriented. Today, these market dynamics essentially no longer exists for us. When we reflect on this portfolio transition, we've never been more excited for the future of Roper given our increased quality, higher growth and more resilient portfolio companies. With that, let me turn the call over to Rob to walk you through our financial summary and our balance sheet position. Rob?
Rob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning everyone. Turn to Page 8 and covering our Q3 financial highlights. As a reminder, as Zack said, all financial results are on a continuing operations basis. Total revenue increased 10% to $1.35 billion. The FX headwind was $20 million or 1.6% and was offset by acquisition contributions. Notably, our mix of business has shifted meaningfully toward more domestic revenue post the announced majority sale of our industrial businesses. The U.S. now represents approximately 85% of our revenue helping to shield our results from the impacts of any currency fluctuations. Q3 organic revenue increased 10% with broad-based strength across each of our three reporting segments: Application Software grew 7%, Network Software grew 10% and Technology Enabled Products grew a robust 15% organically. EBITDA margin increased 80 basis points to 41.1%, resulting in 12% EBITDA growth. Adjusted DEPS was $3.67, well above our guidance range and 18% higher than last year. Q3 adjusted free cash flow was $353 million, which was 9% above prior year. Excluding the Section 174 tax law change we discussed last quarter, quarterly free cash flow grew 17%. In the quarter, we made $157 million of additional tax payments related to our recent divestitures. Per our normal convention, those payments have been adjusted out of our reported cash flow, so overall, an excellent third quarter, as Neil said, and great momentum heading into Q4. Next slide. Turn to Page 9, looking at our strong financial position. We did complete the Frontline acquisition early in the fourth quarter, utilizing a combination of our balance sheet cash and a draw on our revolving credit facility. As of today, our draw and revolver balance sits at $2.2 billion. We expect to fully pay down the revolver balance with the proceeds from our industrial sale, which should close late in the fourth quarter. So after taking into account the receipt of those industrial transaction proceeds, we'd expect to end the year with a net debt to EBITDA ratio pro forma for our recent acquisitions in the mid-2s. Our consistently strong cash generation quickly refreshes our capacity for capital deployment. So looking forward, we remain active on the M&A front and we have the ability to deploy an additional $4 billion plus of capital now through the end of 2023. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to review our segment performance.
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Rob. Let's turn to Page 11 and walk through our 3Q highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $644 million, up 7% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 43.6%. Across this segment, we saw recurring revenue, which is about 75% of the revenue for this segment increased 8% in the quarter. This recurring revenue growth is enabled by strong customer retention and continued migration to our SaaS delivery models. Across this group of companies, the financial strength was broad and it's been quite consistent for several quarters running. As we highlight a few businesses, we'll start with Vertafore, who had another great quarter of bookings growth, revenue growth and margin performance. Vertafore continues to see success in their software solutions targeted to the PNC insurance market with particular strength in the enterprise class market segment. Across both Deltek and Aderant, we continue to see solid new customer adds and nice momentum and migration towards their SaaS solutions. Also in the quarter we acquired TIP Technologies for Deltek, a leading software provider servicing the GovCon manufacturing and QA market and viGlobal for Aderant, a leading human resources and recruiting software tool for global law firms. CBORD, our nutrition and access management software business had strength across both education and healthcare and end markets. CliniSys and Data Innovations continue to exhibit strong demand and operational strength. CliniSys continued its market share gains across Europe and DI continues to demonstrate product market fit by gaining share of wallet across large healthcare systems. Strata continues to be solid for us as evidenced by strong new customer adds, cross-selling and renewal activity. Finally, Frontline will be reported in this segment starting in Q4. Looking at the outlook for the final quarter of the year, we expect to see organic growth in the 6% to 8% area. Turning to Page 12. Revenues in the quarter for our Network Software segment were $347 million, up 10% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were strong at 54.5%. The 10% organic growth in this segment is underpinned by 16% growth in recurring revenue. As we dig into business specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses continue to be fantastic. The marketing conditions while slowing a touch on the carrier side of the network remained favorable, these businesses saw nice new customer adds and ARPU increases during the quarter. Moving to foundry, our software business that enables live-action filming and computer-generated graphics to be combined in a single frame – frame again demonstrated their financial strength. Net retention was very strong and ARR grew in the strong double digits again. Foundry's success is rooted in their fast-paced innovation capability and favorable long-term market conditions. Growth in our businesses that focus on alternate site healthcare was led by SHP and SoftWriters and importantly retention rates across each of these businesses remained extremely high. Finally, iTrade, our network food supply chain business and iPipeline, our life insurance SaaS business that tech enables the quoting and underwriting processes, each had solid customer additions, which helped drive strong ARR growth in the quarter. Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect to see 8% to 10% organic growth for this segment. As we turn to Page 13, revenues in our tech-enabled products segment were $360 million, up 15% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for this segment increased nicely to 37.2% in the quarter. It's very nice to see 15% organic growth in the quarter and easing supply chain challenges. While supply chain challenges remain, we experienced demonstrable easing conditions especially as it relates to chips and chipsets. We are cautiously optimistic conditions will continue to improve. Let's start with Neptune, which once again set records for orders and quarter end backlog. For a few quarters running, Neptune has been able to gain market share by successfully maintaining industry leading product lead times while simultaneously launching new products both in terms of cellular connectivity and static meter reading technology. To this end, Neptune continues to experience accelerating demand that are static meter solutions. Verathon was simply strong. They grew nicely in the quarter driven by momentum across all three components of their product portfolio: bladder volume measurement, video innovation and single use bronchoscopes. As it relates to Northern Digital, they set a new record for quarterly revenues as they experience continued strong demand for their precision measurement solutions. Our outlook for the final quarter of the year is 5% to 7% organic growth for this segment as we have a more difficult comp heading into Q4. Now, please turn to Page 15 and let's review our updated and increased outlook for the balance of the year. As a reminder, last quarter, we increased our adjusted DEPS outlook to be between $13.46 and $13.62. We are now once again increasing our guidance to be between $14.09 and $14.13, an increase of $0.57 at the mid-point. This increase in guidance is driven by our strong third quarter performance and the momentum we carry in Q4, together with the addition of Frontline Education. Embedded in this guidance is full year organic growth of 9% plus an increase from 8% to 9% organic growth guidance discussed last quarter. As we look to the fourth quarter, we're establishing DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.72 and $3.76. Now we're concluding comments and we'll get to your questions. As we turn to Page 16, we want to leave you with the same key points with which we started. First, we had another great quarter of operational and financial performance, and we are increasing our outlook for the year. Second, we acquired another leading knit software business, Frontline Education. Third, we continue to have substantial M&A firepower north of $4 billion. And fourth, perhaps the most important, the new higher quality Roper portfolio is becoming ever more visible. As it relates to our strong start, we grew revenues organically by 10% and EBITDA by 12%. We're lifting our full year organic growth and DEPS guidance based on the factors previously discussed. Regarding capital deployment, we have been active. Over the past couple months we deployed just over $4 billion. To this end, our prudence and patience are being rewarded through the identification of selections of these high quality assets. We continue to have a large amount of available M&A capacity north of $4 billion. We continue to be very active in the M&A markets, but as you saw in Q3, as always, we remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital. Finally, and perhaps the most important, the new higher quality Roper portfolio is becoming increasingly more evident, and we have never been more excited about the future of our enterprise. As we turn to your questions, let us remind everyone that our strategy is the same. We compound cash flow by acquiring and growing niche market leading technology businesses. This is what we've done for over 20 years and will continue to do. In addition, our value creation and governance model remains unchanged. We operate a portfolio of market-leading businesses and defensible niches. Each of our businesses has high levels of recurring revenue, strong margin, and competes based on customer intimacy, which yields highly resilient, organic growth rates. We operate a highly decentralized operating structure that focuses on long-term business building. Our culture sets a very high bar for performance and focuses on continually improving. We are all paid to grow, which reinforces our culture of transparency, nimbleness, and humility. Finally, we redeployed the vast majority of our capital to acquire the next great business. We do this with centralized corporate resources in a highly disciplined, thoughtful, and analytical manner. This strategy unchanged, delivers compounded and superior long-term shareholder value. So thanks for joining us this morning, and with that, let's open up to your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
Neil Hunn: Hey, good morning Deane.
Rob Crisci: Good morning Deane.
Deane Dray: Hey, I know we're not seeing it in any of your reported numbers today with all this upside, but had there been any changes in customer behavior on the software side, given the uncertain macro, whether it's velocity of new contracts, orders, customer adds, anything kind of below the radar screen?
Neil Hunn: Yes, Deane, nothing in a meaningful sustained manner. Right? So I think we attribute that first to the markets that we serve. Right? So think about customers in healthcare, education, insurance, food, government contracting, utilities I mean, the macro forces generally are lessened or less impactful in those end markets. ARRs, I think, they are up the double digits 10%. So that's always a leading indicator of the strength. But there is certainly quarter-to-quarter there can be some noise. And so last quarter we're looking at, for instance, PowerPlan minus off some softening, but that recovered this quarter. And so it's not to say there is not pockets of things we look at, but nothing in a sustained manner at this stage.
Deane Dray: That's great to hear. And as a follow-up can you expand on this initiative to structurally improve the longer term organic growth rates of the businesses? And just so we're clear, part of your acquisition criteria has never been to buy the fastest top line growing companies because that just doesn't fit the kind of where you are looking for these unicorns that have high barriers to entry that private equity is not going to take public. So you've never been focused on the real, sexy top line growth, but what is the target when you say kind of long-term improvement in organic growth?
Neil Hunn: Yes, I draw you back. This is the same thing we've been talking about since really over the last four or five years since we became COO and CEO and the team we have in place today. So, we historically – long history this – we've said this is a GDP plus a little bit grower, and as we've restructured the portfolio and as we've talked about here increased the expectation outlook for more organic out of existing portfolio, now it's mid-single digits certainly through cycle. And we are always looking to continue to improve that. We've talked at NASOM [ph] about the desire to improve the organic growth outlook through our governance system of our businesses, thinking about how to do strategy right, where to play and how to win, how to execute that strategy in a process in discipline manner, and then how to build team and talent to sort of use that as a long-term competitive advantage. We've been at this with the portfolio for three or four years, and we're starting to see some signs of improvement. So, we're encouraged, but it's an ongoing body of work that never ends.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Scott Davis at Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Davis: Hey, good morning guys.
Neil Hunn: Hey, Scott.
Rob Crisci: Good morning.
Scott Davis: Great results as usual. It probably sounds like a broken record after kind of a decade of that. But I was hoping for a little bit of a play-by-play on frontline. Were there the same kind of number of people that showed up for the auction, was there less, was it a little less competitive, the same? Just a little bit of a play-by-play will be helpful.
Neil Hunn: Sure. Appreciate the opportunity to talk about that. I'll tell you, you never have perfect information. And so this is using all of our inputs and reading the tea leaves to really understand what happened. In the process the seller here Thoma had some bespoke reasons they needed to get liquidity from an asset they chose this one. They happened to time it in the market where private equity bidders had a difficult time bidding because there was not, or has not been a private leverage loan market. And so in that result, the process was thinner competitively, meaningfully thinner competitively and that's why we believe we are able to get a very fair price for the asset. So the process dynamics were a little bit different. And just another example of sort of the patience and our commitment to investment grade leverage and the conservative posture of our financial policy enables us to sort of move nimbly when an opportunity presents itself.
Scott Davis: Got you. That's helpful. And can you give us, just as a follow-up, just a little bit of sense of magnitude of price in your 10% growth number this quarter? Is it a third, a half, something that you can give us just a sense of what component that was?
Neil Hunn: It's very difficult for us to sort of bifurcate volume and price. Keep in mind we're 75% software. Inside software the growth algorithm of every one of our software businesses, you would trip a little bit. There is price baked in every year to sort of offset – mostly if not all of attrite. When you're cross-selling and upselling it to the customer base that gives it to your net retention and you are adding new customers to get the total growth. And so pricing and value capture is just completely native to the inner workings of the pricing model inside a software. And it's not – and it would be generally consistent with the past. I mean, there may be a little bit more prices, labor has gone up in the software model. As it relates to the product businesses, our product businesses have done a fabulous job of essentially passing the cost increases through with the margin to our customers. As you know that lags a little bit. It showed up in margins this quarter in [indiscernible]. That will continue to bleed out over the next several quarters as the backlog that was built early in the years is shipped. And so the teams have done a nice job with that.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Hey, good morning guys.
Neil Hunn: Hey, good morning.
Rob Crisci: Good morning.
Joe Giordano: Hey, just to follow kind of on Deane's question, we are starting to see like at least announcements about layoffs at tech companies and these kind of things as their business starts to slow. Obviously the businesses you have very different. But if you were to start extrapolating those type of announcements down to permeate throughout the broader economy, like how do you like play that scenario with your businesses? Like, okay, we're seeing this and that means this much impact to some of these software businesses and here is what we do and here is how we kind of think about that. Like, kind of like run us through that playbook.
Neil Hunn: Yes, so, it is company specific, right. So every company is going to adjust as their market demands. As a general matter as large tech employment softens I view that as a good thing for our business because it makes it easier for us to hire the labor and talent that we need to hire. Here is point one. Point two, is keep in mind what we do for our customers. Right? We are selling and delivering to them the thing they need to run their business. So we are mission-critical to what they do and our pricing model is vastly fixed subscription. So it's not volume or transaction based. So we should be relatively muted to sort of short cycle fluctuations and the macroeconomic indicators. And so a little bit better labor environment, I think, is unbalanced a good thing for us.
Joe Giordano: And then as you think about going forward in M&A, just given where the stock is derated, we haven't been in a situation where some of the dealers you might look at or hire multiples than Roper itself. So, like how are you kind of thinking about actionability of certain things just given where the stock trades?
Neil Hunn: We're always focused on improving both the scale and the quality of the enterprise. It's been 20 years, it will be the next 20 years and finding the best asset at the best prices we can find. And there is no difference in that going forward.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Christopher Glynn at Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning. 
Christopher Glynn: Was curious on the NSS margin seem to step out a bit nicely very strong incrementals. I just want to kind of discuss if there is a mixed shift there that's kind of episodic or kind of sticky.
Rob Crisci: Yes. Hey Chris, it's Rob. I don't think anything really to call out. I mean, we had really strong organic growth with these software businesses that comes through with great incremental. So I'm just looking back to the margins. Last year, I think, we ended last year at 54 in the fourth quarter we were 54.5 EBITDA here. So yes, no, I think, it was a nice quarter performance, probably similar for the fourth quarter in terms of EBITDA margin for the segment.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And thinking about frontline accretion, if we take the $175 million of EBITDA maybe that's $160 million EBITDA and then there's might be some net interest increase expected there. So just curious how to put that together.
Rob Crisci: Yes, that's right. So for the fourth quarter we've got about $40 million of EBITDA in for Frontline. And there is about $24 million, excuse me, of incremental interest. If you look at where we were before to now, as I mentioned earlier, we did draw on the revolver and so we're paying the revolver interest for much of the fourth quarter than we're assuming that the industrial sale closes late in the quarter and then that interest expense would go away. So I think the math on that is about $0.12 of our sort of $0.57 guidance increase was Frontline.
Jason Conley: Depreciation is about $7 million or $8 million a year.
Rob Crisci: Yes. Thanks Jason.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to circle back to Network Software in terms of the top line, because I think you've had now sort of six quarters consecutive of around double digit organic sales growth. And I was curious to what extent it's the same one or two businesses driving that consistently or is it kind of different horses pulling it along at different times and kind of the leadership is changing? And any thoughts on the next few quarters, which businesses you see driving the Network Software organic growth?
Neil Hunn: Yes, sure. I'll take a crack at it and then ask Rob if he wants to correct or amplify anything I say. So it's been a pretty consistent set of performance across the various businesses. We've talked for many quarters about the strength of U.S. Canadian freight match, right? It's just been fantastic for us. It continues to be good. For the last two or three quarters, we've talked two quarters this quarter and last quarter we've talked about how – the rate of growth is slowing a little bit, but it's still very good. Even this quarter there was a strong number of new career ads, so we would expect that to sort of slow down a bit over the course of the next year. The other businesses, Foundry, SoftWriters, iTrade, SHPI pipeline are just solid performers that have been very consistent and generally don't have that macro sort of tailwind that the freight match businesses have had. So we wouldn't expect any meaningful change from those businesses. Anything you want to add or comment?
Rob Crisci: No, I think that's fair.
Julian Mitchell: Thank you. And then just on Technology Enabled Products, you have had issues like most manufacturers from cost inflation, from supply chain challenges for some time. Those are starting to ease it looks like. So maybe help us understand what you are assuming for the pace of those supply chain challenges easing? And then assuming you've got volume growth ahead, easier supply chain and inflation, what kind of operating leverage should we expect in the TEP segment, not so much next quarter, but let's say next 12 months?
Neil Hunn: I'll take the first couple – excuse me, parts of that question around supply chain pacing and improvement and let Rob comment about the OP leverage or EBITDA leverage there. So, just to set the context for us the supply chain, we have been modestly gated from shipping in a one or two of the businesses for short periods of time but for the most part it's been about – we've been able to ship, but it's been about a higher component cost and expedited logistics in order to sort of both inbound and outbound the products. This quarter demonstrably supply chain especially around chips improved intra-quarter. We went into the quarter assuming it's going to be difficult and it meaningfully improved during the quarter. So it's our expectation that that part of supply chain element continues to ease Q4 and beyond. There's still a little bit of challenges around the certain components principally come out of China, think motors and things like that, that are still have longer lead times, but those appear to be abating as well. We don't assume that happens per se in Q4. As it relates to the price and sort of pushing that through, we talked about a little bit before the companies have been very good at taking price increases to offset the component price or cost increases, but it lags by a handful of – not a handful, a couple quarters between you take the order and when you deliver the order and that started showing up this quarter.
Rob Crisci: Yes. I'll just add to that. There's great momentum here. Neptune has been performing really, really well. Neil talked about how they're – they're still seeing great orders and great backlog and great momentum and so that should – that should certainly carry forward. So with the supply chain issues easing as Neil mentioned, I mean, leverage here I think it was 50% EBITDA leverage in the quarter. We should be north of 40% leverage over the long-term as these businesses continue to grow strong organically and so that would tick-up the EBITDA margins a little bit in that segment.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Steve Tusa: Hey, good morning.
Neil Hunn: Hey, good morning, Steve.
Steve Tusa: Just on, ongoing back to the front line so if that adds like $0.12 in your, I think your sequential increase in earnings is I don't know, like $0.07 or something like that. Yes, what's the, I know it's only down modestly but maybe sometimes you have an increase in the fourth quarter. I think obviously seasonality has changed a bit, but anything else kind of moving around or is everything generally just kind of flat from 3Q to 4Q EPS?
Rob Crisci: Yes. I think if you look at the guide the tap volume, revenue is a little lower fourth quarter versus third quarters. You mentioned some supply chain ease and some stuff shifted – shifted a little bit earlier. Other than that, I think you're right. I mean it's just – it's a much different portfolio, right? We don't have the seasonality with all the energy businesses with the big fourth quarter, that's just – that those businesses have been divested.
Steve Tusa: Right. And then just for free cash flow can you just baseline us on fourth quarter or just for the year? What you guys would've, I know you don't guide but we're getting close to the end of the year; maybe you could just baseline us on what you expect for the fourth quarter and deferred revenue is actually pretty negative in the quarter what's going on there?
Rob Crisci: Yes. So I mean, cash flow should be strong in the fourth quarter. Obviously, setting aside the fact that we're still making payments on the divestitures it's always our best working capital quarter on deferred revenue. In the fourth quarters when we get most of our renewals for the software businesses, that's usually the best quarter for that as well. So it's usually a very good working capital quarter. And then if you look forward we certainly don't guide cash flow, but we are really, really well positioned for great cash conversion next year as we get these cash tax payments behind us and now we have a portfolio with even better working capital characteristics, and so we feel great about our abilities to continue to compound cash flow moving forward.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Allison Poliniak: Hi, good morning.
Neil Hunn: Yes. Good morning.
Allison Poliniak: Just want to go back to the network software businesses and particularly easily, look you touched on freight matching and then iTradeNetwork both businesses, which I would've thought had pretty strong market share historically. Could you maybe talk to with the new customer ads, are those markets evolving for you or is it something that Roper is doing specifically to capture share in there? Just any thoughts.
Neil Hunn: So yes, each one is different between the freight match, the North American DAT freight match business, and iTrade on what they're doing all their product and go-to-market strategy. Rather the DAT, I would – there's a lot that we could unpack and delighted to talk to you about this on a call down or a more longer form way but the short version is they've done a terrific job on both their freight match product and their analytics product and then creating product tiers based on the value the customer wants to sort of buy into. At DAT also something like 75% of the bookings today are through their e-commerce channel where three years ago or five years ago, it was zero. So they've really removed the barriers to do business with them and when you look at the ARPU increases like 70% of the ARPU increase has been because customers have elected to a higher package because there's been more value to sort of get from the network. So they've done a wonderful job that's bespoke and unique to DAT like it is for all 27 businesses that iTrade. The go-to-market motion there has been the – it's been mostly the same but this over the course of probably about a year-and-a-half ago, the company released a new product offering to enable the supplier part of the network to do easier trading with the buy side of the network is the simplest way I could describe it. So think of it as like a lighter weight supply chain management software tool for half of the network and it's just been – it's a very consistent booking, so over the last four or five quarters as it's been released.
Allison Poliniak: Great, thanks. And then just as we think of that organic, recurring revenue in the software businesses that has been quite strong. Do we assume a similar level of the recurring revenue growth as we look to our Q4 numbers? Just any thoughts there?
Neil Hunn: You want to comment?
Rob Crisci: Yes.
Neil Hunn: Q4 or recurring?
Rob Crisci: Yes. Should be – should be similar that that we've seen. That the trends there continue to be very positive overall on recurring revenue for sure.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Joe Ritchie at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Joe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning everyone.
Neil Hunn: Hey Joe.
Joe Ritchie: So guys, at the beginning a bunch of questions on the, just a long-term growth rates for your businesses and clearly like the portfolios evolved a lot over time and I think last quarter we talked about 6% long-term growth. I was just wondering as you kind of look at the 27 companies that now make up broker; are there businesses that you expect to grow, let's call it high-single, the low-double digits over time because of where they are in their maturity? And if there are, could you maybe just talk through some of those?
Rob Crisci: Yes. I think the place to start right is the removal of the cyclicality, right? So if you look at where Roper is now is as we mentioned earlier, it's a very different portfolio because we don't have that 40% of Roper that was projects and cyclicality back to 2018. So that, so now you don't have the situation where you might have something that grows 15% one-year and then goes down 15% the next year. So really the whole portfolio is sort of plus or minus mid-single digit organic and in a bad year something might be up 2% or 3% and in a great year it could certainly be double digits. And I'll let Neil expand on that.
Neil Hunn: Yes. What I would maybe add three points to that, Joe. One is it's, when you look at the 27 companies it's a very tight distribution in terms of the growth rate. There's not – it's not a bar bill where you got 10 companies growing 2% and 10 companies growing 15% of averages into something different. It's a very tight, I think the only two acquisitions we've done, we've announced as a high-single digit organic growth business. Everything else has been mid-singles and we're working to improve that. So as a general matter, think of it as a mid-single digit through cycle organic growth portfolio that is – has all the casual characteristics you'd want to see with that. We'd see operating leverage occur, so that's going to translate to a little bit more cash growth organically. And then you got to layer on top of that the M&A flywheel. So we feel very comfortable. We have a mid-teen sort of cash flow compounding growth algorithm that's embedded in our strategy.
Joe Ritchie: Got it. That's super helpful. And then I guess my following question, I hadn't historically thought of you guys as being potentially a big beneficiary of some of the stimulus packages that have been passed. And so as an example, like the K-12 education stimulus funding but then as you're talking about seaboard and now there's this, this acquisition with Frontline, I'm just wondering like, do you guys see yourselves as a beneficiary of some of these stimulus measures where we actually haven't seen a lot of that spending yet come through and perhaps we'll start to see some of that in 2023?
Neil Hunn: We think the answer is no. We're not in any meaningful way or even in a minor way a beneficiary of the stimulus or COVID funds. For instance, with Frontline we studied that extensively during a diligence process and while the K-12 districts certainly on-boarded stimulus and COVID dollars, the vast, vast majority of those funds, the one-time funds were spent on one-time type items principally getting for instance student to device ratios to one-to-one for instance. They were districts were super hesitant to buy a recurring software package with one-time money. So Frontline we don't believe in any meaningful way was a beneficiary that we think that's a good thing goes to the durability of the growth drivers of the business. Seaboard, same thing, there's what Seaboard does, I mean it's about food and management for these K-12 and higher Ed facilities and at campuses as well as access management and integrated security and they have not been a meaningful beneficiary. So no is a short answer.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Brendan Luecke with Alliance Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Brendan Luecke: Good morning, all. Thanks for taking my question. A few quick ones on the M&A environment. So you have been – you haven't been shy in the path levering up for big deals. Has your target leverage ratio changed all with the higher rate environment?
Neil Hunn: No. The leverage ratio is completely independent of the rate environment.
Brendan Luecke: Okay, great. And then it within a higher rate environment, do you feel you have an advantage over PE funds, particularly with the IPO market dried up?
Rob Crisci: We've long said that higher interest rates are, we believe are a – we're a benefactor of that. 70% for the reasons that 70% to 80% of our capital that we deploy is from our internally generated cash flow. Obviously 20% to 30% is from the balance sheet. So we're versus private equity who are competing against 50-plus percent of what they deploy in may be every deal is variable rate debt at the moment. So they are much more indexed and their values are much more indexed to shorter term rates than anything that we would see.
Neil Hunn: And very high yield...
Rob Crisci: …and very high yield.
Neil Hunn: And that those markets have been closed.
Rob Crisci: So we think we're beneficiaries in a higher rate environment because one would think over time, if these rates are sustained and that's a big, if they're sustained, then you'd see valuations adjust accordingly, and so we think that's our view on that. We've been very consistent of that view for a long time.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Alex Blanton at Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please go ahead.
Alex Blanton: Good morning. Monitoring around my second question, would you wait until I say thank you before you cut off my mic please?
Zack Moxcey: Yes, sir no problem.
Alex Blanton: The first question is in the tech enabled segment you had a 15% growth. What portion of that was just due to supply chain catch catching up on things that had been delayed because of the supply chain?
Rob Crisci: Alex, that's a hard one to give you a level precision. I will tell you we did better in the quarter because the supply chain got better. I mean, Verathon had a lot of things that had to go exactly right and they – most reverse what they did. Neptune did a nice job as well. Northern Digital did a great job. So a chunk of the beat would certainly be attributed to that.
Alex Blanton: Yes. Okay. And secondly on the acquisition front in the past when you've made a big acquisition like this, you've had a pause in your acquisition pace until you transition into the new company and get things squared away. What do you expect to do this time? You have $4 billion in dried powder. Would you expect to use some of that or a lot of that or a little of that in the coming year?
Rob Crisci: Yes, Alex so there's certainly no need for a pause to deliver because our leverage rates are still relatively low because we are benefiting from the fact that we did these divestitures and we're still really redeploying those proceeds in addition to our normal cadence. So really no reason to pause. So we're very active in the M&A markets. Today we'll remain active. We might do deals very soon. It might take us a couple quarters as Neil mentioned, we're going to be very, very patient. But we're certainly going to remain active and there's not going to be any sort of a pause in that activity. Like you've seen after some of the larger deals where we did lever up and we're in a situation where we sort of had to take some time to reduce the leverage.
Alex Blanton: And there's a good backlog of companies to supply that you're looking at?
Neil Hunn: Yes. The market is, the number of deals then and processes that are in slide are quite large, yes.
Alex Blanton: Okay. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: You're welcome. Thanks Alex.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now turn back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remark.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: Thank you. The conference is now concluded and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may not expect your lines and have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-22 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded and all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the second quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. During the quarter, Roper announced an agreement to sell a majority stake in our industrial businesses. Results for these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, the numbers shown in this presentation are on a continuing operations basis. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense income tax restructuring expense associated with the pending sale of our industrial businesses. And lastly, we have adjusted our cash flow statement to exclude the cash taxes paid related to our 2021 divestitures. GAAP requires these payments to be classified as operating cash flow items even though they are related to the divestitures. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This morning, we'll start by reviewing our second quarter highlights and financial results then we'll review our segment detail and our increase out for the year then get to your questions. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the main takeaways for today's call are first, we had another great quarter of operational and financial performance, and we're increasing our outlook for the year; second, during the quarter, we entered into an agreement to divest the majority stake of our industrial businesses; and third, we have north of 7 billion of available M&A firepower. Looking at the second quarter, we continue to be pleased with the quality of execution across our enterprise. This quarter is characterized by having very strong order activity and solid organic growth of 11%. Of particular importance, our growth was quite broad-based across our three segments. Consistent with our commentary during the last several quarters, not only did we grow nicely within the quarter, but the quality of the underlying businesses also improved as we saw our software recurring revenue base grow 12% on an organic basis. In addition to our strong software growth, our product businesses performed very well in the quarter, experiencing very high levels of demand and record levels of backlog. Once we complete the divestiture of the majority interest of our industrial businesses, the quality of our portfolio will be significantly improved across several dimensions. First, we will be meaningfully less cyclical with about 75% of our portfolio being software and the balance being medical and water products. Second, we'll have higher levels of recurring revenue with 80% of our software revenue being recurring in nature. Also, a large percentage of our product revenue is reoccurring in nature, such as Neptune's replacement demand and our medical product consumables. And third, we'll be even more asset-light given a vastly improved working capital profile one that generates significant increasing amount of cash as we continue to grow. And finally, with the closing of our industrial divestiture, which we anticipate will occur later this year, we'll have north of $7 billion of M&A capacity. We are very active in the M&A markets, but also remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital. We are confident in our ability to deploy this capital wisely, which in turn will further improve both the quality and scale of our enterprise. We are proud of our operating team for their execution, a very solid quarter. Now let me turn the call to Rob, who will walk through our financial summary. Rob?
Rob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 6, here, we want to briefly cover our Q2 performance compared to our guidance, including the industrial businesses now reported as part of discontinued operations due to the pending sale. On that apples-to-apples basis, our Q2 of $3.95 compares quite favorably to our guidance of $3.80 to $3.84, an $0.11 beat at the high end of our guidance, a very strong quarter. Next slide. Turning to Page 7 and covering the Q2 financial highlights. Here, we will review some of the key financial metrics on a continuing operations basis which is our reporting basis for earnings and guidance moving forward. Total revenue increased 10% to $1.31 billion. Organic revenue increased 11% with strength across each of our three reporting segments. Application Software grew 7% organically as our two largest businesses, Deltek and Vertafore continue to perform very well. Network software grew 15% led by continued exceptional performance at our freight matching businesses. Finally, our new technology-enabled products segment grew 13% organically, aided by an excellent quarter from Neptune. EBITDA margin was 39.3%, resulting in EBITDA increasing 10% to $515 million. DEPS on a continuing ops basis was 3.43%, 16% higher than last year. Net working capital is now negative 17% of Q2 annualized revenue as a result of our higher quality portfolio. Q2 adjusted free cash flow was $252 million, which was 19% below prior year, but still represent a 17% three-year CAGR versus 2019. Notably, like many technology companies, our cash flow was negatively impacted by the Section 174 R&D capitalization change that took effect for 2022. We paid $49 million in Q2 related to Section 174, and we expect to pay an additional $50 million for Section 174 in the second half. Importantly, this tax law change only impacts the timing of when the taxes are due, and not the overall amount of tax owed or our tax rate. Additionally, in the quarter, we made tax payments related to the gains on the 2021 divestitures of TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy. Per our normal convention, those payments have been adjusted out of our cash flow. Finally, we are very pleased to announce the completion of our new five-year $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. We are grateful for our bank group and their continued support, and I personally like to thank Shannon O'Callaghan next to me for the excellent work in leading the process for Roper. So in summary, with a $3 billion cash balance, our new revolver in place, and the future proceeds from the closing of our industrial sale later this year, we are very well positioned for meaningful capital deployment. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil.
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Rob. Congrats to you and your team for upsizing and extending our revolver, especially in these market conditions. As we turn to Page 9, we summarize for you our go-forward portfolio of 26 businesses arrayed across three segments: application software, network software and tech-enabled products. In the 8-K issued a few weeks ago, we provided historical annual and quarterly financial disclosures on this segmented basis. Also for the first time, we're breaking down our revenues by type. As you see, 61% of our total revenue and 82% of our software revenues are recurring or reoccurring in nature. 74% of our total revenues are software related. For several quarters, we've communicated how the quality of our revenue stream continues to improve. You can see this point well illustrated here. Our 11% organic growth is underpinned by a 12% growth in our software recurring revenue base. Further, you can see the breadth of the growth, growth in software and products. Our strategy for nearly two decades now has been to improve the quality of our enterprise, and this is clearly reflected on this page. We cannot be more excited for our future. Let's turn to Page 10 and walk through the 2Q highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $627 million, up 7% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 43.1%. Across this segment, we saw recurring revenue which is about 75% of the revenue for this segment increased 8% in the quarter. This recurring revenue growth is enabled by strong customer retention and continued migration to our SaaS delivery models. Across this group of companies, the financial strength was quite broad. As we highlight a few businesses, we'll start with Deltek. The Deltek team posted another great quarter of strength across all end market serves with particular strength in their construction contractor end market. In addition, Deltek continues to gain momentum, driving adoption to their cloud-based product offerings. Vertafore had an excellent quarter, which was highlighted by strong ARR bookings activity and revenue growth. Also during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of MGA Systems. This tuck-in acquisition enhances Vertafore's ability to compete and win in the managed general agent segment of the property and casualty insurance ecosystem. CliniSys and Data Innovations continue to exhibit strong demand and operational strength. CliniSys continued its market share gains in the U.K.; DI continues to demonstrate product market fit by gaining share of wallet across large health systems and the VA. Strata continues to be super solid for us. The acquisition of EPSI has been exceedingly strong as Strata has successfully lifted and shifted many EPSI customers to the Strata cloud-based offering. At the same time, Stratic continues to improve the legacy EPSI product release and support capability. We remain committed to meeting the EPSI and Strata customers where they are. Finally, Aderant continues to be a solid performer for Roper, extending their share gains in the large loss space. Aderant continues to see an acceleration of SaaS booking activity driving substantial increases in the recurring revenue base. Looking to the outlook for the second half of 2022 in this segment, we expect to see mid-single-digit growth for the balance of the year, driven by continued ARR momentum. Turning to Page 11, revenues in the quarter for our Network Software segment were $343 million, up 15% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were strong at 52%. The 15% organic growth in this segment is underpinned by 19% growth in recurring revenue. As we dig into business-specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses continued to be exceptional. The market conditions while slowing a touch on the carrier side of the network continue to be favorable. During the recent surge in transportation volumes, the market share of the ecosystem represented by the spot market increased as it became easier to transact volumes in the spot market compared to the contracted market. We believe this is a secular trend that DAT will benefit from over a multiyear arc. In addition, DAT continues to do a nice job of increasing revenue per user by both adding features and improving value capture. Finally, over a longer arc planning horizon, our freight matching businesses continue to be well positioned to enable the further digitization of the spot freight market. Moving to foundry, our software business that enables live-action filming and computer-generated graphics to be combined in a single frame continued their recent financial strength. Net retention is north of 110% and ARR grew double digits again. Foundry success is rooted in their fast-paced innovation capability and favorable long-term market conditions. ITrade our network food supply chain business and our pipeline, our life insurance SaaS business that tech enables the quoting and underwriting processes, each had solid customer additions, which helped drive strong era growth in the quarter. Finally, our businesses, which focus on alternate site health care, namely skilled nursing, assisted living and home health grew nicely in the quarter despite their customers' growth being constrained by staffing shortages. Proud of the execution here. Turning to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment, driven by continued recurring revenue momentum and moderating growth for our freight match businesses. As we turn to Page 12, revenues in our tech-enabled products segment were $340 million, up 13% on an organic basis despite the very challenging supply chain environment. EBITDA margins for this segment were 34.9% in the quarter. Let's start with Neptune, which had record orders, revenue and quarter ending backlog. For a few quarters running, Neptune has been able to gain market share by being successful in keeping product lead times at industry-leading terms and releasing new products, both in terms of cellular connectivity and static meter reading technology. As a fun fact, Neptune turns 50 later this quarter and next year will mark our 20-year ownership anniversary, a great run so far with an even better forward view. Congrats Hunn to you and your team for building such a great company. Verathon, Northern Digital and each of our medical product franchises continue to see very strong ordering activity but were hampered by a variety of supply chain challenges during the quarter. That said, the teams are executing exceptionally well, and we remain confident in our ability to execute through these challenges. Looking over the horizon, each of our medical product businesses are benefactors of secular tailwinds, namely the increased demand for single-use devices and the aging of the population. As it relates to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect to see high single-digit growth for this segment, underpinned by strong demand and backlog levels, but somewhat constrained by the current supply chain challenges. Now please turn to Page 14, and let's review our updated and increased outlook for the balance of the year. As a reminder, last quarter, we increased our adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $15.50 and $15.75, which included $2.30 from our industrial businesses. Given our agreement to divest our industrial businesses, we are removing the $2.30 million from our guidance model going forward. So on a new curtailing ops basis, our previous guidance equates to $13.20 to $13.45. Based on our strong Q2 and second half visibility, we're now increasing our continuing ops guidance to be between 13 46 and 13 62. Embedded in this guidance is full year organic growth of 8% to 9%, again, on a continuing ops basis. As we look to the third quarter, we're establishing DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.42 and 3.46. Now our concluding comments and we'll get to your questions. As we turn to Page 15, we want to leave you with the same three points with which we started. First, we had a strong quarter of performance, and we're increasing the outlook for the full year. Second, we took strategic actions to invest a majority stake in our industrial businesses. And third, we have a tremendous amount of M&A firepower north of $7 billion. As it relates to our strong start, we grew revenues organically 11%, EBITDA 10% and DEPS 16%, and free cash flow has grown 17% on a three-year compounded basis. We are lifting our full year organic growth in DEPS guidance based on the factors outlined during the call, specifically strong recurring revenue growth and a record demand for our product businesses. Finally, we have reloaded our balance sheet and continue to have a highly active and engaged pipeline of M&A opportunities. We have north of $7 billion of M&A available firepower. As mentioned at the start of today's call, our high levels of activity are equally matched with our patience and discipline, and we remain confident in our ability to deploy this capital to further improve the quality and scale of our enterprise, just as we've done over the past two decades. Finally, kudos to Rob and Shannon and the finance team for increasing the size and term of our $3.5 billion revolver. As we turn to your questions, let us remind everyone that our strategy is the same: We compound cash flow by acquiring and growing niche market-leading technology businesses. This is what we've done for over 20 years and will continue to do so. In addition, our value creation and governance model remains unchanged. We operate a portfolio of market-leading businesses and defensible niches. Each of our businesses has high levels of recurring revenue, strong margins and compete based on customer intimacy, which yields highly resilient organic growth rates. We operate a highly decentralized operational structure that focuses on long-term business building. Our culture sets a very high bar for performance and focuses on continually improving. We are all paid to grow, which reinforces our culture of transparency, nimbleness and humility. Finally, we redeployed the vast majority of our capital to acquire the next great business. We do this with a centralized corporate resource team in a highly disciplined, thoughtful and analytical manner. This strategy, unchanged, delivers compounded and superior long-term shareholder value. So thanks for joining us this morning. And with that, let's open it up to your questions.
Operator: Yes, thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Congrats on the first earnings report under the new look, Roper.
Neil Hunn: No, thank you.
Deane Dray: If we could start, I really like the new breakout on revenue on Page 9 as well as Page 19 in the appendix, which shows you the same information broken out by segment. How do you expect that mix to change over the next couple of years, especially in the conversion and migration to SaaS?
Neil Hunn: Yes, Deane. So really, the -- in the recurring line, that 54% line on Page 9, embedded in that line is both the on-premise maintenance and the SaaS. And so the migration will happen inside of that line. Now what we'll see is, it'll -- as that happens, we get an uplift from the on-prem maintenance to the SaaS because you're delivering more value -- and so you'll see sort of a long-term multi-multiyear tailwind in that line, but it happens and the conversion happens within that singular line.
Deane Dray: Okay, that's helpful. And then for Rob, look, we're all kind of calibrating the Section 174 and the impact, and I'm glad you added that one sentence that says it doesn't change the total amount. It just changed the timing of the tax payments -- just clarify how that plays out for the course of the year and the comps for next year. And then is there -- on the working capital that negative 17%, is that the new run rate based upon the new earnings and mix for Roper going forward? And is there still upside to that?
Rob Crisci: Yes, yes. So on working capital, yes, I mean, the 17% is the run rate. I think there is upside, right? We expect to grow these software businesses as they continue to grow, they'll generate more cash and work capital should get more negative over time. Yes, on 174, it is -- it will be a total $100 million headwind for this year. So, it's basically around $25 million a quarter we paid. As you know, we make two tax payments in the second quarter, that's why it was 49% in the quarter. Yes. So, obviously, there's been a lot said about this. The law could change at some point, and then we'd get that money back. So, it's really just -- you look at the same deductions over time, but certainly, now you have to wait for the deductions basically.
Operator: And the next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: So I wanted to talk about the new segment a little bit in the medical products. Talk seeing if you could break out some of the supply chain impacts on margins the revenue gating aspect and any abnormal kind of levels of backlog, how you'd characterize that, how let's think about it.
Rob Crisci: Yes. So the performance was very good. So we're certainly, like everyone else who sells products, have some supply chain issues. I mean backlog is I think, double if you look where we are this year versus the same time last year. So there's plenty of opportunity to continue to grow the revenue. A little bit of margin impact. We think that gets a little bit better in the second half. I think our business has done a great job of pushing through price. And so that takes some time to start to sell the products at a higher price versus the cost, so I think that's a little bit better over time. But everyone is managing it really, really well. So, we feel really good about our operations.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And for a follow-up, if you look at Slide 12, the tech-enabled products, the EBITDA margins are down about 5.5 points Q2 this year versus 2020 second quarter. Just can you talk just conceptually about that bridge, what that gap represents?
Rob Crisci: Yes, so 2020 was an outlier because of the big Verathon quarter with the -- in the heart of COVID. So that's when Verathon had that just extremely strong growth as we're trying to fight the virus. And so, I think probably '19 is a little bit more normalized from a margin standpoint, but we do think that those margins should tick up over time.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Scott Day with Cornelius.
Scott Davis: I wanted to talk a little bit about price. Is there -- is there -- I imagine the price escalators in the SaaS, -- is it -- is there some sort of basis like CPI? Is it half a CPI? I mean, can you give us just a little bit kind how you think how price gets passed through and those things?
Neil Hunn: Yes. So there's -- and price -- if you're -- obviously, you're specifically talking about software. I mean, there's the way you sort of capture price and value capture and software is a little bit different than the product. So in the software, you're right, for the all that subscription and maintenance is generally tied to a CPI plus a touch -- which is -- so we were able to see price. The other thing that's just also just naturally embedded in the software business is price. I mean, it's a part of the growth algorithm in each and every year. The customers are used to taking price. And obviously, with inflation, interest rates higher, then there'll be a little bit more price. The offset to that is the cost structure in the software businesses increase through increasing labor wages, but it happens over a longer arc of time, and it's less spiky than what you see in the product businesses. So naturally, as the pipeline of that is you get a nice matchup of the increase of labor cost with the pricing on the software part of our business.
Scott Davis: And is there a difference in kind of pricing when you think about recurring versus non-recurring? It's kind of Dean's question. I was a little confused in your answer, and maybe just because I only had one cup of coffee, but -- is there a difference -- I mean you mentioned you kind of add more value and you get a little bit more price, but go back and talk to me like I'm three-year old.
Neil Hunn: No, so apologies if I was confusing. So there's two issues we're talking about. So on price, on software; if you're a well-run software company, you're taking price on both the cost of the software in a perpetual world and the maintenance on that. So you move them up in tandem, where you don't end up in sort of a challenging thing that some software companies do that ends up being a bad thing is they only take price up on the maintenance and not the initial software. Our companies take them up in tandem, so they stay together. So that's the pricing point. Dean's point was asking about what's the relationship between on-premise maintenance, which we get paid once we deliver the perpetual software and SaaS and the SaaS shift. And so as we migrate or lift and shift a customer from on-premise to our cloud, as you're doing that, you're delivering more value, not only hosting the application and all the security, you're also delivering the most recent versions or keeping them on the most recent version so they take advantage of the most recent features and you're just generally eliminating sort of the headaches of running the software for the client. Because of that value bundle of SaaS, you are able to capture more value, oftentimes, 2x on a recurring basis or a touch more. So it's -- that's about the value proposition of moving to the cloud versus your straight question of what happens in a price increase environment for the software.
Rob Crisci: And just to give you a sense, we're roughly 75% subscription and 25% in maintenance today. So we're still -- we're already largely in the cloud. There's roughly $200 million of license revenue that would go away over time and convert to that subscription revenue that Neil mentioned. But as you know with us, that's a long period of time, driven by the customers. And so it's a really good story, I think, on the recurring revenue line.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joe Giordano: So now you've gone through the GIG code change and all this. I'm just curious, Neil, Rob, what's your initial kind of conversations were with the new cohort of investors that you'll likely talk to now? And what were some of the things that maybe some initial pushback you're getting from them some things that they like and how have those discussions kind of overall have gone so far?
Neil Hunn: Yes. I would say the GICS code change, it's not like this light switch that's happened or all of a sudden, every conversation we're having with the buy-side is a different person. In fact, it's quite the opposite. I mean, it's a slow evolutionary sort of change here. We've been to a singular software conference where we had half a dozen conversations. They were generally the same conversation we have with our legacy shareholder base, which is what's your business model, what's your flywheel and what are the risks, what's the durability and quite similar. A little bit -- a little discussion, obviously, on growth a little bit on the cash flow dynamics of the business, a little bit of the business model mix between recurring, non-recurring, but they're the same questions really.
Rob Crisci: I was just saying a lot of excitement, right? Because I think as we said at that conference, we were at intra-quarter that we're the fourth largest application software company, I think, in the S&P 500. And a lot of these analysts are just getting to know us, and I think they're really excited when they look at our past and our future prospects. So we're excited to expand to a new shareholder race while, of course, also making sure that our current shareholder base is continually happy with their investment in Roper.
Joe Giordano: So when you think about M&A, does the divestment like -- is there a step change function that happened internally with DRI that makes finding new companies that clear the threshold harder I'm guessing just mathematically taking out the industrial businesses, make CRI higher or more negative or however you want to look at it. And then like maybe you could have slotted in a business that previously could have improved the profile of Roper, but maybe now that business might not meet the threshold. Is that accurate? Or is it just not material enough to worry about?
Neil Hunn: It's not material enough to worry about, but let me tell you why. I mean, -- the -- for essentially my entire almost 11 years I've been here, we've looked at the same cohort of targets, which are wonderful asset-light software businesses. And that's the cohort we're looking at now, right? So, it's just -- it's not about becoming even more asset-light once yours asset lines we are. It's about staying as asset light as we are. That's why the universe of targets is plentiful.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak: On that network software business, understanding that freight matching sort of the growth and sort of the moderation there, could you maybe talk to the balance of the businesses in that segment in terms of the overall combined? Is it mid- to high single-digit growth? I'm just trying to understand the impact that the freight match had on it.
Rob Crisci: Yes, most of the businesses in that segment are normally sort of mid-single-digit organic businesses that occasionally do higher than that, very rarely do lower than that. And so, I think as you get into the second half of the year, those are sort of doing what they do, and then you just have a little bit of moderation in the freight matching growth.
Allison Poliniak: And then just kind of pulling on to that last M&A question, certainly, the software is a focus in terms of M&A. What about tech-enabled products? Is there anything you guys are kind of looking at that we may be clear that hurdle or is it sort of off the table there at this point?
Neil Hunn: No, it's definitely not off the table. It has not been off the table. We just haven't actioned anything there in quite a while. So if it's an asset-light tech-enabled product than business that is a leader in a small market, the competitive forces are stable, sort of all of our criteria, then it's definitely something we would look at.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Julian Mitchell: Maybe I just wanted to ask a couple of questions on the software business. First off, in terms of freight match, help us understand the cyclicality of that business. There's been a lot of scary stories about freight recessions all year long in the U.S. How should we expect that business to perform in that type of macro? And I guess NSS has enjoyed fantastic operating leverage. We see the margins going up to the low 50s in Q2. What's the risk to that sort of incremental margin, if you like, from freight match rolling? And then any color in application software about the license business? Again there were some questions after the SAP update earlier this week.
Neil Hunn: So let me take the DAT One and the application software license one, and I'll let Rob talk about the margins if that's okay in NSS. So on DAT, DAT grew through the 2019 freight recession. But it has been just spectacular the last couple of years at DAT for two reasons. There's certainly a cyclical tailwind it's had, there's also a secular tailwind that it's enjoyed. The secular tailwind endures. That's why the business is able to sort of grow through in '19. And principally, in summary version, that secular tailwind is that the spot freight markets are just a more liquid, less -- easier to transact end market today than it was two years, three years, five years ago. So you see that the spot market -- market share of the total freight increasing over this time mark, and that's been a benefactor of DAT and its customers, and that's going to continue. As DAT in the market, it will continue period, but then it may accelerate over the next five-plus years as we further tech-enable the broker's business model, right? As it relates to the license -- excuse me, the perpetual license activity in application software, it's solid orders in the first half and in the quarter. I think we're maybe modestly different than like an SAP because our price points are much, much lower, right? I mean our -- something like that. So, we're not -- these are -- we're important and we're sizable for our customers. But these are -- our price points, I mean, a big deal for us is a $1 million, $2 million, $3 million deal, not multiples of that. So Rob, do you want to...
Rob Crisci: Yes. Then on the margins, I would not be concerned that margins would take a step backwards growth were to slow there. I mean, these are businesses that sort of all have those structural EBITDA margins in that 50% plus range. And so, I'd expect that to continue even if growth were to slow a little.
Julian Mitchell: And then maybe sort of following up more for Rob this line. Just you have an out this big divestment, you've got restated numbers out there. How should we think about any changes from here around or changes in the sort of go-forward run rate for things like tax rate in the P&L? Maybe corporate costs and then kind of free cash flow conversion. Any changes in those three metrics as we look at the sort of new go-forward Roper?
Rob Crisci: Yes. There shouldn't be any meaningful changes in terms of tax rate. I think in terms of conversion, I mean, clearly, there's a lot of noise around cash taxes this yearas we've been talking about, and that's sort of part of the price to pay also when you do these transactions that we think are the best thing to do for the Company in the long term. So I think if you look forward to next year and beyond, I mean, our free cash flow conversion should be at the levels it's been historically and probably a little bit better because we have even more negative working capital. Just better quality portfolio, less cyclicality. And so, I think the cash flow conversion should get a little bit better over time. And corporate, yes, I mean I think the run rate that you see now sort of worth continuing ops is the right run rate moving forward.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa: Just a question on the cash. I know you guys don't guide on cash, but usually it gets on kind of an underlying basis, seasonally better in the third and the fourth. Anything changed from that perspective? And any kind of color on how you'd expect it to kind of bounce back here in the third and the fourth from second quarter levels. It's a little bit lumpy in the first and second quarter.
Rob Crisci: Yes, I think that's right. So seasonally, fourth quarter is always our best working capital quarter because that's when you're getting a lot of the renewals in software. So we would expect working capital to be a pretty good guy in the second half. And we sort of talked about the cash tax situation. And I think everything else is performing really well to generate a lot of cash.
Steve Tusa: And then on the revenue side, when you think about your recurring, is there on the accounting there in 606, do you book a percentage of those deals, the three-year, three-year type of deals? Do you book a percentage of those upfront as per the 606 accounting? I know you have different businesses in there, so maybe they behave differently from an accounting perspective. But is there an element of that in the revenue there?
Jason Conley: Yes. Steve, this is Jason Conley. A lot of the term licenses, there's a portion of that that does get recognized upfront, so multiyear term license is very small for us. Only a couple of businesses have that. And then our perpetual licenses are also booked upfront as part of 606, a portion of it.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie: Maybe just the first question on this new portfolio going forward, how do I think about like the right long-term organic growth rate for this business over time? I think we've historically kind of thought about your legacy businesses kind of like somewhere in that 4% to 5% type organic growth rate. I'm just wondering if this business is going to achieve healthier growth longer term.
Neil Hunn: So it's -- when we did the -- announced the transaction with the Industrial and Process businesses, we showed a chart that showed the long-term growth rate -- historical long-term growth rate of the go-forward portfolio is about 6%. So, that's where we would expect at the baseline, and then obviously, we work every day to try to make that better. But right now, that we would sort of say 6% to the new norm.
Joe Ritchie: And then I guess this whole this whole conversion from on-prem to your SaaS business, it seems like you guys are well on your way there. I'm just curious like how much is that kind of like added to the growth rate in recent years? And then that extra, call it, I don't know if it's an additional 20% to 25% that you are expected to convert, how do we think about that as kind of like an added benefit that you'll continue to see in the coming years?
Neil Hunn: Yes. It's been, as we said for a while, it's been a modest growth driver. And just to go through it for a minute, there's the good guy and there's a bad guy, right? So the bad guy is if you're in a year where you're selling a perpetual deal, let's say it's a $1 million deal. You booked the vast majority of that revenue in that year. If that deal converts to a subscription or a SaaS deal, maybe that's I mean maybe that's priced at, I don't know, $300,000 a year, plus or minus. So in that end year, there's a $700,000 bad guy between the upfront license versus the SaaS, and that's assuming you booked the SaaS deal on January 1. So there's a little bit of a bad guide when that happens. But what is overwhelmed that for us to a slight net positive is the lifting and shifting of our large installed base of maintenance customers. So as you take the -- in this same example, if you have a cohort of customers paying you $300,000 a year, you're going to lift and ship them into the cloud in the plus or minus $600,000 a year. So you get that and that nets out to be a slight good guide. We've gotten many years of that dynamic. Even if I had to guess, it's 7 to 10 years of that dynamic because we're not forcing our customers to migrate. We're very much in the posture of meeting our customers where they are relative to wanting to do this. And that's why it will take a while to do it.
Rob Crisci: Yes. I'll just add that every business is on a different sort of phase of this journey, right? I mean many businesses have been SaaS in the very beginning, and they're always 100% SaaS. Other businesses were mainly on-prem like an Aderant. That's really the one business we have talked about where really their customers are really starting to move to the cloud. Deltek has been a mix over time. Most of the rest of the businesses are really kind of already SaaS, at least several businesses that we bought the last four or five years.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Real Research.
Jeff Sprague: I guess as we're transitioning to software, I'll just ask an annoying industrial question. Just going back to the deal itself and the structure there are some additional detail on that 8-K, obviously, that wasn't -- certainly wasn't clear to me at the time the deal was announced. And what's still not clear to me is what the back end might look like for you guys on this deal, right? With CD&R paying $829 million for 51% of the equity, and then with new debt on the deal of 1.950 billion I mean it looks like the enterprise value is 3.6 billion an 11x multiple, right? If you guys have taken 2.6 out upfront, it's very unclear how we think about the back end.
Neil Hunn: So, the way that we would think about it, I'll just -- I'll put it through the lens of our new partner, right? So by the way, the maths went through, we would say it's correct, right? And so, it was that 3.5, 3.6 is the enterprise value upfront, that's 11x this year, 13.5x last year. In terms of EBITDA more like in that 13 range if you look over the last five years, given the cyclicality We, too, so the amount of capital that CD&R put in is basically equal to our amount of capital, still in the business. CD&R's business model is to drive a 3x-plus money-on-money return over their investment horizon. So if we and they are successful, then you get a triple of our stub of equity, right? It's sort of a framing of how to think that. So maybe there's a couple of billion plus or minus of upside in addition to getting the liquidity on the 800 or 900 million that we have there. So call it, $2.5 billion to $3 billion on the back end if underscore and capitalize if things go successful over the next five or so years.
Jeff Sprague: Is that based on the premise that they actively do other things with the business? For example, other M&A in the business, and wouldn't that dilute you or would you participate in kind of incremental investments in the business to get it ready for eventual sale?
Neil Hunn: Yes. So we're totally aligned -- two questions in there, right? So the implied is around the growth thesis of the Company. So we're completely aligned with our partner on the growth thesis. It centers on continuing to invest in the organic growth that we've been doing with these businesses for the last four or so years and then building it at sort of a capital deployment or M&A flywheel or repeat of a flywheel. Without getting into the details of how the Company is going to execute that because it's still very much being formed, but at the highest level, this is a -- one, it's a cash generative asset, right? So the goal for all of us is to run a levered asset and use that leverage in the cash generation as a primary source of funding. So you don't have a dilutive effect. If there is a transaction where CDR is going to kick in equity, then we have the option to consider that. And we'll make that a deal-by-deal sort of decision. We think it's in the best interest of our shareholders. And so, yes, there could be a little bit of dilution, but that dilution is sort of somewhat factored into the math that I gave you before.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Rob Mason with Baird.
Rob Mason: Just first, a technical question around the guidance. So, the core growth guidance for the year is eight to nine. Did that change versus where it would have been on an apples-to-apples basis three months ago?
Rob Crisci: I would say slightly higher, maybe like 0.5% or so. But I mean it's -- I think we are seven to nine in our last guide and the businesses we divested were slightly higher. Those go away, and we've raised eight to nine. So, I think it's a little bit of a net raise, but not by a lot.
Rob Mason: Where would you slot that increase within the segments -- the three segments now?
Rob Crisci: So I'd say the biggest business that has a better outlook is Neptune. They're just doing incredibly well, as we said in the prepared remarks in their second half, given their backlog, given their ability to execute and deliver to their customers. It looks really, really strong. So that's really the one I think that's gotten quite a bit better. Everything else I'd say is about the same as we had it three months ago.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.
Alex Blanton: Yes, I just wanted to look at this $2.30 per minute. What was that in the first quarter?
Rob Crisci: Yes, it was about $0.50 in the first quarter and what $0.52 in the second quarter.
Alex Blanton: And then what is your guidance for that for the third quarter?
Rob Crisci: So, we're not guiding it by quarter, right, because it's in disc ops, but it's 230 for the full year. So generally, the fourth quarter is the best quarter for those businesses given the cyclicality and the oil and gas markets.
Alex Blanton: Yes. Well, the thing was I was trying to work out what the total would have been with that in there for the rest of the year quarter-by-quarter. But I guess I can do it with what you just said. I'd like to talk about the future and the future is acquisitions, of course. How does that look now? What's the pipeline like how far are you along in putting the work to $7 billion? What are you working on? What kinds of things are you working on? Just give us some color on that because I think that really is what is going to give investors confidence.
Neil Hunn: I appreciate the question and the opportunity to address it. So it's been a very above-average level of activity really for this year. Obviously, we've not posted anything of size, just a couple of small tuck-ins. We're being -- while we have $7 billion, we're continued to be just ridiculously selective as we've always been. We run this sort of -- we have our criteria. We stay committed to the criteria. There's a lot of analytics, there's a tremendous amount of discipline and a ton of patients. And the reason we have that posture is we're making decisions to put companies in the portfolio, which we view as a forever staying. And so every deal matters, everyone's got to be right and everyone has got to meet the criteria. And so -- but we're super busy, and we'll continue to sort of keep this posture and to grow the quality and the scale of the enterprise. But we -- there's no timetable on that. We're just going to we're going to do the right deal at the time in which it presents itself.
Alex Blanton: But do you think that you'll be able to do some this year?
Neil Hunn: We would like to be -- we would like to do it. But again, there's no timetable. There's no clock ticking in the back of mine or this team, or our Board's head about we have to get X dollars deployed by X date. So I think that leads to bad decision making, but it's an active market. So, the odds are we'll get something done this year, but we'll just have to see how...
Rob Crisci: Yes, yes, just we're very active working on a lot of different projects like we always are. So, we're certainly very active.
Alex Blanton: And just characterize the pipeline of how many businesses are available compared with the past. And what are the prices like compared with the past and so on.
Neil Hunn: Yes, so I mentioned it's -- we never want to quantify the number of deals either by number or dollar size in a pipeline. We think it's -- for us is it sufficient or not. And so it's clearly sufficient. I said at the beginning of your question, it's been an above-average level of activity for this year. Valuations, hey, it's, high-quality assets are still highly priced. I mean that's a bit of the reason why we're being patient. And we'll just -- we believe that market comes to us over time, and so we remain patient for the right company with the right characteristics at the right price.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's presentation. Thank you for dialing in, and you may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-26 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today’s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the First Quarter Financial Results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Shannon O’Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today’s call. We have prepared slides to accompany today’s call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now, if you will please turn to Page 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today’s call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today’s call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Unless otherwise noted, we will discuss our results and guidance on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now, if you please turn to Page 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Zach and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. As I’m sure many of you have already noticed we are introducing Roper’s new logo on today’s call. Our new logo better reflects our transformation journey while paying honor and respect to our legacy. As a fun fact [ph] our legacy logo was first introduced in 1977. So with that let’s turn to Page 4 and review today’s agenda. As usual, we will start with our quarterly highlights followed by a segment by segment overview, then go through our increased outlook for guidance expectations and leave plenty of time to address your questions. Next slide please. As we turn to page 5, the main takeaways from today’s call are first, we continue to increase the quality, predictability and durability of the underlying business models and revenue streams. Second, we continue to deliver strong organic growth and operating results enabling us to increase our organic growth outlook and desk guidance through the year. And third, we have substantial M&A capacity given our rapid de-leveraging and completion of our TransCore divestiture. As it relates to the first quarter, we are delighted to report another strong quarter of execution and positive momentum across the portfolio. Specifically, we grew revenue on an organic basis 11% in the quarter. This growth was broad based across each of our four segments. Not only did we grow nicely in the quarter, but the quality of the underlying business also improved as we saw double-digit organic increases and a recurring revenue base. In addition to our strong software growth, our product businesses performed quite nicely in the quarter as well experiencing very high levels of demand and record levels of backlog. Also during the quarter, we completed the divestiture of our project based TransCore business. As you will know we now have $3.2 billion of cash on our balance sheet. When combined with our borrowing capacity we have over $5 billion of available capital deployment fire power which when deployed will further help drive cash flow and shareholder value compounding. So with this, definitely a solid start to the year. Now, let me turn the call to Rob, who will walk through our financial summary. Rob?
Rob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to page 6 and covering some of the Q1 financial highlights. Total revenue increased 11% to $1.53 billion. As Neil mentioned, organic revenue also increased 11% with broad base strength across our four reporting segments. Application software grew 9% organically, network software grew 16%, our MAS segment grew 7% and finally, our smallest segment Process Technologies was up 18%. EBITDA margin was 37.8% for the quarter, resulting in EBITDA increasing 8% to $577 million. Notably, that $577 million of Q1 EBITDA on a continuing operations basis is actually higher than the Q1 EBITDA we reported last April when we still owned and of course consolidated TransCore and the other two divested businesses. Adjusted DEPS for the quarter was $3.77, which was well above our guidance range of $3.63 to $3.67. Free cash flow was $459 million with solid EBITDA cash conversion of 80%. That's above the Q1 conversion levels we experienced in 2019 and 2020, but below last year is exceptionally strong Q1 conversion of 96%. To that end, there are two discrete cash items that combined to create an $80 million Q1 headwind versus prior year. As discussed on last April's call, last year's Q1 included $40 million of accelerated payments to CliniSys. Furthermore, this year’s Q1 reflects a $40 million increase in incentive compensation as a result of our strong 2021 performance compared to the pandemic year of 2020. So stepping back, we are of course focused on long term compounding here at Roper. In the three blue bars at the bottom of our page, you can see our three year compounding from Q1 2019 for revenue EBITDA, and free cash flow was 10%, 13% and 17%, respectively. So in summary, an excellent start to the year. Next slide, turning to page 7, which is an update on our financial position. Turning to the balance sheet, as Neil mentioned, we have a very large cash balance, which is the result of closing the transport divestiture during the quarter and receiving the gross proceeds. We have yet to pay the approximately $650 million of taxes related to the divestitures, which will be paid during the final three quarters of 2022. As of March 31, as Neil mentioned, our cash balance stood at $3.2 billion, which brings our net debt down to $4.2 billion, or approximately 1.9 times our TTM EBITDA from continuing ops. So with our healthy combination of balance sheet cash, continued strong free cash flow generation, and our investment grade leverage capacity, we are very well positioned to deploy $5 billion or more of capital. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to cover our segments in greater detail.
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Rob. Let's turn to page 9 and walk through the Q1 highlights for application software segment. Revenues here were $632 million up 9% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 44.1%. Across this segment, we saw recurring revenue, which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for the segment increased 10% in the quarter. This recurring revenue growth is enabled by strong customer retention, continued migration to our SaaS delivery models, cross selling activity, and new customer ads. Across this group of companies, the financial strength was quite broad. As we highlight a few businesses, we'll start with Vertafore. Vertafore had an excellent quarter, which was highlighted by strong air our bookings activity and revenue growth. In addition, during the quarter Vertafore released its new commercial submissions product line. To remind everyone Vertafore strategy is to help tech enable the workflows for their P&C agent customers. This new product is a meaningful step in this direction, as it allows agents to quote multiple carriers in it’s simple automated workflow. Great stuff from the Vert 14. Turning to Deltek, they posted another great quarter with strength across all end markets served. Deltek continues to gain momentum driving adoption to their cloud-based product offerings. Deltek also continues to be benefited by having favorable, secular tailwinds. CliniSys and data innovations continue to exhibit strong demand and operational strength. Specifically CliniSys continued its market share gains in the U.K. As reminder, CliniSys is one of four strategic IT vendors to the National Health Service. DI was awesome in the quarter with continued strength driven by their direct go-to-market approach and large wins within the VA system. Aderant continues to be a solid performer for Roper, extending their share gains and the large law space. Also in the quarter, licensing activity tied to seat expansions was very strong. They also continue to see meaningful shift towards our cloud offerings driving substantial increases to the recurring revenue base. Strata whose cloud-based software helps hospitals plan budget and manage their operations continues to execute their cross selling strategy with TTM net retention north of 110%. Of note, we're in the midst of an orderly leader transition at Strata. Dan Michelson, who has led Strata for the last 10 years is retiring. As an element of Roper’s talent offense, Strata has been developing its next CEO, John Martinez for the past several years. As part of John's development, he started in the CFO function, then led commercial and go-to-market functions, and then became the Company COO. Strata’s future is secure given the successful succession planning. Big thanks to Dan for all your leadership and accomplishments at Strata. John, we are super confident with you at the helm. Your new role is well earned, congrats. Finally, PowerPlan posted a strong double digit growth quarter driven by recurring revenue ads and higher services utilization. They also have a substantial new product roadmap slated for this year, which we're looking forward to discussing on subsequent calls. Looking to the outlook for 2022 on the segment, we expect to see mid-single digit growth for the balance of the year, driven by continued strong ARR momentum. With that, let's turn to the next slide. Turning to page 10. As a reminder, the financial performance for this segment, as well as the next two MAS and PT are shown on a continuing ops basis. Revenue in the first quarter for a network segment was $369 million up 16% on organic basis and EBITDA margins were strong 51.2%. The 16% organic growth is underpinned by 16% growth in recurring revenue, which is roughly 80% of the segment's revenue base. As we dig into business specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses continue to be super strong during the quarter, the market conditions continue to be quite favorable, which led to record levels of Network ads again, especially on the carrier side of the network. In addition, DAT continues to do a nice job of increasing revenue per user by both adding features and improving value capture. Over a longer arc of time, our freight matching businesses continue to be well positioned to enable the digitization of the spot freight markets. Moving the foundry, our software business that enables the combination of Live Action Filming and computer generated graphics to being applied into a single frame had record bookings revenue and EBITDA for the first quarter. Net retention is north of 110% and ARR grew double digits. Foundry success is rooted in their fast paced innovation capability and favorable long term market conditions. iTrade, our network food supply chain business and iPipeline our life insurance SaaS business helping to tech enable the quoting and underwriting processes each had strong customer additions, which helped drive strong ARR growth in the quarter. Finally, RFIDs had record orders with growth coming from secure print and identity management applications. Turning to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect to see high single digit organic growth for this segment, driven by a combination of strong recurring revenue momentum and favorable market tailwinds. Kindly turn to the next slide. As we turn to page 11, revenues and our MAF segment were $392 million up 7% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for the segment were 31.5% for the quarter. Again, these results are in a continuing off spaces. Before getting into business specific details across this segment, demand continues to be very strong and product backlogs continue to be at record levels. Also, each of these businesses are navigating the current supply chain complexities. While margins were in line with their expectations, they were negatively impacted versus prior year, and are impacted by the availability and pricing of raw material components as well as expediting freight costs. As our businesses increase, price actions take hold throughout the year, margins should improve as we get into the second half. As it relates to our business specific commentary, we'll start with Neptune, which had record orders, revenue and quarter ending backlog. Neptune has been able to gain market share by being successful and keeping product lead times at industry leading terms and releasing new products, both in terms of cellular connectivity, and static meter reading technology. Verathon, Northern Digital and each of our medical product franchises remained super solid. Verathon continues to see strong demand and market share gains in their single use Bronchoscope category, and NDI sees the same in both our optical and electromechanical measurement capabilities. These businesses are beneficiaries of long term and favorable market tailwinds. As it relates to our industrial businesses, demand throughout the quarter was quite strong given the improvement end market and capital spending conditions. As it relates to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect to see high single digit growth for this segment underpinned by strong demand and backlog levels, but somewhat constrained by the current supply chain environment. Net net, we expect a very strong balance of the year for this group, for the balance of the year for this group. Now let's turn to our final segment Process Tech. As you turn to page 12, revenue on our Process Tech segment were $134 million in Q1 up 18% on an organic basis, EBITDA margins were 32.5% in the quarter. These results are also reported on a continuing ops basis. The story here is we continue to see improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment, and very strong demand. Cornell continues to perform well for us delivering record orders and backlog in the quarter. The strength is partially based on market conditions but also based on Cornell's product innovation, as they're seeing very nice demand pickup for their IoT connected pumping solutions and the share gains they're joining as a result of their niche focused go-to-market teams. Also, our upstream oil and gas businesses saw strength in the quarter. Similar to that of our MAS product businesses, these businesses are also being impacted by supply chain challenges but continue to navigate well into the issues. As we return to the outlook for the balance of 2022, we expect high teens organic growth based on strong levels of backlog and solid market conditions. Now please turn to page 14. And we'll talk through our 2022 increased guidance outlook. Based on a solid start to Q1, strong growth in our software, recurring revenue base and record levels of product demand and backlog we are increasing our full year 2022 DEPS guidance to be in the range of $15.50 and $15.75 up from our original guidance of $15.25 and $15.55. Underpinning this DEPS guidance is our increased organic revenue growth expectation of 7% to 9% for the year. We expect the steady tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. As we look to the second quarter we’re establishing DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.80 and $3.84 again on a continuing ops basis. Now our concluding comments and we'll get to your question. As we turn to page 15 in our closing remarks, we want to leave you with the same three points we started with; one, as we grow, we are increasing the quality of the underlying business and business model. Two, we had a strong start to the year and three we have substantial M&A capacity available to us. As relates to our strong start, we grew revenues organically 11% and EBITDA 8%. More so we have grown our cashflow 17% on a three year compounded basis. We are lifting our full year organic growth and DEPS guidance based on the factors outlined during this call. Specifically strong recurring revenue growth, record demand for product businesses and generally favorable market conditions  Finally, we have reloaded our balance sheet and continue to have an active and engaged pipeline of M&A opportunities. We have north of 5 billion of available M&A firepower. So as we turn to your questions, we would like to highlight that our inaugural ESG report was published to our website earlier today. This report outlines our commitment to ESG and our sustainability principles. And with that, let's open it to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Christopher Glynn: Yes, I was curious about the double digit recurring software revenue in aggregate. I forget what the comparison was. But I don't think it was particularly light. So just curious about, were you surprised by that metric in the quarter, and any implications on how the overall execution and strategic throughput is flowing?
Neil Hunn: Yes, thanks for the question. As we look back over the recurring revenue, overall growth over the last five quarters, I think, four or the five have been in the double -- low double digits. And so we were not surprised by it. But it certainly encouraged by strength, also encouraged by the breadth of the converse of the strength that wasn't isolated in one or two businesses really quite broad based against everything. And, and we also just as a Q1 there was a lighter comp from a year ago.
Christopher Glynn: Okay, thanks. And for my follow up, just curious, as you look at the pipeline, curious, if any comments on the mix of platform deals, versus bolt on variety if they're both well represented?
Neil Hunn: Yes, they're certainly both well represented. If you go back over, I think the last 15 years, something like 90% of the capital deployed at Ropers, done on platform deals intent on bolt-ons. It's not a budget; it's just a historical reference to platform versus bolt-on’s. If we were guessing it might feel a little bit more towards bolt-on’s in the next 10 years, because we have more things to bolt things into. But the preponderance of the capital deployment will be on platform deals and the pipeline is, is well weighted across both of those.
Operator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Good morning Dean
Deane Dray: Hey, can you start with process technologies, this is where if we were going to see big pressures on the industrial side, supply chain really didn't see that it came through, especially on an organic revenue growth, but just can you give us any specifics regarding the supply chain challenges? And where is there a big ramp? Are you seeing it yet in CapEx that would greater focus on increasing U.S. shale?
Rob Crisci: Yes. Hey, Dean, it's Rob. Yes, so we're still seeing, of course the impact, like everyone else of supply chain. I mean, you can see it in our MAS segment, probably more so than in process. But the businesses have done a really, really good job of working through it. And so, that allows us to have, great organic growth, and then, the, the margins, which were downloaded in MAS on supply chain should incrementally improve moving forward. So, I think overall, the businesses are doing a great job of handling what everyone else is, is also having to deal with.
Neil Hunn: Dean, this is Neil. The only thing I'd add to that we said it a number of times in the prepared remarks is the level of order activity throughout the quarter in the backlog. We entered the quarter with and left the quarter with or just are quite robust to give us quite a bit of confidence for the balance of the year.
Deane Dray: That's all good to hear. And then on the M&A front, you've got the balance sheet fully reloaded, but they're what's the tone of the market right now has with so much macro uncertainty. Are sellers just holding back now is there any pause in activity and just what's the expectations over the next couple of quarters?
Neil Hunn: Yes, hard to predict you know exactly how things will unfold in the near term. But the activity in the market and the activity that we're involved with is, is very high, at or above where it's been on. If you looked at the last five years, sort of average pace, we're at or above that, in terms of the number of deals we're seeing and never imagined meetings we're doing, the number of processes were involved in, ultimately, how many of those transact, based on uncertainty on the valuation market is still very much to be determined, but encouraged by the level of activity currently in the market?
Operator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Kiran Patel-O'Connor: Hi, this is Kiran Patel-O'Connor on for Julian. So just looking at operating leverage for 2022. I know you guys had previously talked about approximately 40%. Is that, do you still feel good about that number. And where do you think we should land for Q2?
Neil Hunn: Yes, I think that's, that's a pretty good number for the year, overall for the company, we're still looking at sort of the EBITDA margins relatively flat year-over-year. And so again, it’s sort of a little bit improvement throughout the year, as some of the supply chain stuff, starts to get a little bit better. Again, the software businesses with this really strong organic growth, you get great leverage there. And it's really about are reinvesting in order to make sure there's more growth in the future. So our businesses are reinvesting at a pretty high level, which, which is great to see. And that will continue to drive more organic. And that's really, what moves you up from 40% or 45%, leverage or 50% or whatever it is, is really about the investments that we continue to make.
Kiran Patel-O'Connor: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Mason with Baird. Please go ahead.
Rob Mason: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just so you think about your product centric businesses, both in the U.S. and Process Tech again, you've said it that you expect some sequential improvement as we go through the year in revenue with supply chain helping out some, but could you tease out how much of the revenue growth sequentially is coming from better supply chain versus perhaps price eating a little more, you made the reference in MAS? So that was one question and just around supply chain, what specifically gets better? I mean, is it around chips, electronics or is it other components, and just want to drill into that a little bit?
Neil Hunn: Yes, it's Neil, let me take a take a crack at both of those price versus volume, if you will, and then the nature of or characterize the supply chain challenges. And maybe ask Rob if he has any follow up behind that. So on the price versus volume, it's very hard for us to track with precision, how much of the revenue rolled up at the Roper level in the product businesses is price versus units. That said, we would characterize it that, we put a lot we there's every one of our companies is taken pricing action or actions. We’re certainly not the back, the backstop for global inflation. So we're passing that to our customers. But it does take time for that price to get in. And so for instance in Q1, in the MAF segment, there was a bit of margin pressure, because a lot of the revenue booked was from orders that were in the fourth quarter or the second half of last year that was at a lower price point than the orders that are booked this year. So it takes a little bit of time for that pricing to get into the system. But that's more of a commentary about margins than it is about revenue growth it's just hard to break out. As it relates to characterizing the supply chain challenges. It's not a thing, and it's not even a thing at a company. A company might have a chip problem for a quarter or a few months, and then it might become a glass problem for computer screens. And it might become a caster problem for cart. I mean it really is a little bit of a whack a mole at the individual company level and nothing sort of Pan Roper that we would characterize it as a single supply chain the threat if you will. Rob, anything you want to add to that?
Rob Crisci: Yes, so for me, yes, we had 7%, organic in Q1 and we're calling for HFD for the rest of the year. So I mean, really gradual improving. We've got very strong order performance. We've got of course record backlogs, that great book-to-bill. And so again, a little bit of improvement, we're not assuming that the supply chain improves dramatically anytime soon.
Rob Mason: I see. Okay, that's helpful. And just as a follow up, again, you made the comments that your industrial focus businesses continue to see some good strength through the end of the quarter, but I know you don't have a lot of international or European exposure specifically but Struers is one business that touches that area, just specifically to Europe. I was just curious what you saw as you finished out the quarter and into April?
Neil Hunn: So Struers was had a great quarter, as they saw, I mean, Struers is tied partially to global industrial GDP and also global auto. And so Struers really picked up nicely because of the auto -- the global automotive -- automotive demand. All markets are strong as Struers ex-China for instance in the quarter. So, anything you want to add more broadly on Europe, but…
Rob Crisci: No, I mean, I think overall, we're seeing still seeing pretty good strength across the across the world.
Operator: My next question comes from Andrew Shlosh with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Andrew Shlosh: Hey, good morning, guys.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Andrew Shlosh: So, I can appreciate the color around these supply chain challenges. And obviously, that's not unique to you. But when we think about margins and measurement and analytical and process, from Q1 to Q2, just given the commentary you've given us, do you think that margins would be flattish sequentially, Q1 to Q2 in both of those segments? Or do you even think we could see some expansion there?
Neil Hunn: Yes, I think sequentially a little bit of expansion, Q1 to Q2, not a tonne.
Andrew Shlosh: Okay, that makes sense. And on Vertafore, you kind of started to strike there. Do you know how much that business was up in the quarter?
Rob Crisci: We know precisely how much that business is up in the quarter.
Neil Hunn: Yes, as we as we said, when we bought that business, it's a solid, mid-single digit organic or growth business. And it's certainly done that since we've owned it.
Rob Crisci: It was better than that better than meaningfully better mid singles in a quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Hey guys, good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Joe Giordano: Sorry, I had to jump on this. So apologies if this was asked, just curious in the, like, the overall M&A landscape right now just given what's going on in the market? Like, are you seeing more of a willingness of maybe private companies to sell now? Or are they still trying to like, hey, we'll get back to where we were like, what's the mind-set of a seller now? And where are you like are things more or less actionable than they were, like three months ago?
Neil Hunn: Yes. So what we see is the mark, the activity level, the number of processes, the number of companies that were that we're meeting with the number of diligence streams is, is above trend level, in terms of the that level of activity. I think it's still your question is still yet to be ultimately determined. I think we'll know more over the course of the next quarter or two, as we see if these processes actually conclude, based on if they're willing to accept the price where the market is. And so a little bit of a partial answer to your question, I think we just need a little bit of time for that to unfold.
Joe Giordano: And you guys obviously made a lot of portfolio moves within the last year, maybe some very company specific opportunities. But as you look at your total portfolio, you'd see more opportunities, still ahead of you to kind of prune and kind of find more appropriate owners if you don't think you're the right one for some of the businesses.
Neil Hunn: If you just take that question, and you're sort of elevated a touch, I mean, our strategy has been for 20 years and continues to be how do we increase not just the size of the business, but more importantly, the quality of the business, that's it. That is the whole punch line of our cash return on investment model was how do you improve the quality? And so we've been doing that for 20 years on the buy side, recurring revenue, organic growth, less cyclicality, more asset lightness. As you saw in the last, really three years, there's been a little bit on the sell side. And so the management team and the board looks our charter is to do that is to improve the quality of the business, principally through the buy side and here recently on the sell side.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Steve Tusa: Good morning, guys.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Steve.
Steve Tusa: Congrats on the execution this quarter.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Steve Tusa: Can you guys just give a little more color on how free cash flow should trend over the course of the year, maybe a little bit of a high? No, you're not giving like explicit guidance there. I might have missed it. I was on another call. But maybe there's some high level guide on cash.
Neil Hunn: Yes, so sure. So high level total cash flow is going to be driven by organic revenue and organic EBITDA growth first, which is looking great for this year. And then basically timing of capital deployment and how big the deals are. And so that's why we don't guide free cash flow because we're always going to be, it's always been based on what's our what our total deployment, which of course, we are very patient disciplined. And as we mentioned on Q1, the performance on a conversion basis was very good versus history, obviously lower than last year, given the one timers that we outlined earlier on call.
Steve Tusa: Right. So I guess you're saying that it depends on what kind of deals you do ultimately where the cash ends up, like decreasing?
Neil Hunn: Yes, so the Roper model, right is about double digit long term cash flow, compounding the combination of organic growth and capital deployment. So in 20, we grew up free cash flow 15% in 21, it was 19%. If you look at the three year Q1 CAGR, it's 17%. And so we'll continue to do that moving forward is a combination of organic and capital deployment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please go ahead.
Alex Blanton: Thank you. Moderator, may I ask you, please don't cut me off until I say thank you at the end of my second question. I think that's the best procedure for these Q&A's. The first question is about compressors, controls. Could you give us an update on how that's going? And what the outlook is there? And what's backlog is?
Neil Hunn: Sure, so CCC have very good quarter coming off a great Q4. Order growth was nothing short of spectacular in Q1. We in for infact, it was the largest Q1 in a decade for Greenfield activity at CCC.
Alex Blanton: And does this have to do with the oil price?
Neil Hunn: No, I mean, think of CCC as much longer cycle than that. I mean, these are, for the most part gigantic infrastructure LNG projects that are planned out in some cases, Greenfield decade out. And so there was just a lot of, in this case, a lot of Greenfield activity. And then further if you want to just break you simplify CCC, you basically have a services book in the business and the projects, services for callbacks, meaning coming in for maintenance with strong services for new commission's meaning tied to new activity was strong. We just talked about how Greenfield project work was very good orders and brownfields been consistent. So it's on sort of on the two by two grid. All four part of that of boxes are green for CCC in the quarter.
Alex Blanton: Doing more LNG projects to take gas to Europe would help you, is that correct?
Neil Hunn: As a general matter if there's yes. I mean, if there's LNG compression happening, CCC is benefited by that.
Alex Blanton: Okay. Second question is regarding the $5 billion. Could you just reassure us that there are businesses out there to be acquired that are large enough? That are of the kind that Roper has traditionally purchased, that are large enough to enable your growth to continue at the past rig for how long?
Neil Hunn: Yes, I appreciate the question. I mean, that's always an important investor question. And the answer is a resoundingly yes. We've talked about the size of our broad pipeline. It's it's very, very large, there are many opportunities. We'll have no issue continue to compound and cash flow for many, many more years, based on the availability. Now, the challenge, as we talked about, right is sort of valuations, which remain relatively elevated compared to history. And so the idea is to do the best deal for the best price and by the highest quality business. And so we're working hard on that. But no, we're, we're in no way concerned about the availability of assets. We were very, very busy working on many things, and we feel great about our chances to be very successful.
Alex Blanton: And these are the same kinds of qualities that you've been able to acquire in the past.
Neil Hunn: Yes, you're very similar. If you look at our last dec yes, our last decade of acquisitions, right decade plus, it's very similar call asset quality to all those businesses, the Vertafore,, the Deltek, and all the great things we've done.
Alex Blanton: Okay, thank you.
Neil Hunn: You’re welcome.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-02 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today’s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the fourth quarter and full year financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Shannon O’Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today’s call. We have prepared slides to accompany today’s call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now, if you will please turn to Page 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today’s call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today’s call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Unless otherwise noted, we will discuss our results and guidance on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense, a Sunquest trade name and technology asset impairment related to the merger with CliniSys; and lastly, income tax restructuring associated with our pending divestiture of TransCore. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now, if you please turn to Page 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Zach and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. Let’s turn to Page 4 and review today’s agenda. As usual, we will start with our quarterly and full year highlights. We will then provide details regarding our segment performance, followed by sharing our first quarter and full year 2022 guidance. At the end, we will leave plenty of time to address all your questions. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the main takeaways for today’s call are: first, our strong finish to ‘21; second, that we are setup very well for solid 2022 organic performance; and third, we have substantial M&A capacity given our rapid deleveraging last year. As it relates to the fourth quarter and closed the 2021, financial performance was excellent with double-digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. Additionally, because of our strong cash performance last year, our balance sheet is in a great spot as we exceeded our deleveraging plans for the year. As we look towards our 2022 outlook, we have considerable tailwinds that help setup for a very strong year. Underpinning this outlook is our software recurring revenue growth momentum. Given strong market demand, continued innovation in new products and increased shift towards our SaaS solutions, we exit 2021 with robust ARR growth that carries momentum into ‘22. In addition, our product businesses are experiencing strong demand and record levels of backlog, which provide these businesses with an unprecedented level of in-hand orders and revenue visibility heading into the year. Factoring all this together, we expect 6% to 8% organic revenue growth in 2022. In addition to this organic outlook, our balance sheet is well-positioned to allow us to be more meaningfully offensive with M&A in 2022. So, the table is set for us to have great 2022 and continue our long-term track record of double-digit cash flow compounding. Now, let me turn things over to our CFO, Rob Crisci, to walk through our financial summary. Rob?
Rob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone and thanks again for joining us. Turning to Page 6, looking at our Q4 income statement performance, as Zack stated earlier, all the financials here are reported on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. Both organic revenue and total revenue for the quarter increased 13% to a total of $1.51 billion. EBITDA grew 12% to $576 million. EBITDA margin was down 10 basis points versus prior year at 38.1%. That all resulted in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.73, which was above our guidance range. Free cash flow grew 4% in the quarter on top of last year’s 23% fourth quarter growth. Cash conversion was once again very strong at 35% of revenue and 92% of EBITDA. Q4 was a nice finish to a very strong year and positions us well for a great 2022. Next slide. Turning to Page 7, reviewing the Q4 results by segment, Neil will discuss the full year segment performance in more detail a little later, but we wanted to just highlight the Q4 results by segment here. All four segments grew double-digit organically as our businesses executed very well and continued to win within their niche markets. Application Software segment grew 10% organically with broad-based strength throughout the segment. EBITDA margin increased to 43.8%. For Network Software, excellent 14% organic growth with EBITDA margin increasing to 52.3%. For Measurement & Analytical Solutions, 15% organic growth was broad-based with double-digit growth at Neptune, medical products and our industrial businesses. EBITDA margin was 31.3% as our businesses continue to navigate supply chain challenges. Lastly, for Process Technologies, a nice rebound from last year’s decline, with 17% organic revenue growth and EBITDA margins of 31.2%. Next slide. Turning to Page 8, which is a summary of our full year 2021 financial highlights. For full year 2021, organic revenue growth was 9%. We benefited from both our strong organic growth and meaningful contributions from our recent acquisitions to achieve 19% total revenue growth. EBITDA grew 22% for the year to exceed $2.2 billion. EBITDA margin increased 90 basis points to 38.2%. Full year DEPS increased 23% to $14.18, which was above the high-end of our guidance range. Free cash flow performance was outstanding for the year with 19% growth to $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow represented 31% of revenue and 82% of EBITDA. Excellent cash conversion, which is of course a key component of Roper’s business model and value creation flywheel. We are well-positioned to continue our double-digit cash flow compounding moving forward. Next slide. Turning to Page 9, which is the latest installment in our successful deleveraging story. Including our discontinued operations, total operating cash flow for 2021 exceeded $2 billion. After CapEx and servicing of our dividend, nearly all of our excess free cash flow went to debt reduction. In total, we were able to reduce our net debt by $1.7 billion in 2021, which exceeded the deleveraging outlook we shared with you last January by about $200 million. We ended the year with net debt to EBITDA of 3.1x. Subsequent to year end, we closed the previously announced $350 million Zetec divestiture, which has further reduced our leverage. The closing of the TransCore divestiture expected for later this quarter will bring in over $2.1 billion of additional after-tax proceeds. We are pleased with our performance here as we once again demonstrated our ability to quickly delever after large acquisitions, reinforcing our commitment to our solid investment grade ratings. So with that, I will turn it back over to Neil for the remainder of our prepared remarks. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Rob. Let’s turn to Page 11 and walk through the 2021 highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $2.38 billion, up 8% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 44.2%. Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for this segment increase 8% for the year. This recurring revenue growth is enabled by strong customer retention, continued migration to our SaaS delivery models, cross-selling activity and new customer adds. Across this group of companies, the financial strength was broad-based. To highlight a few companies, Deltek, our enterprise software business that serves the U.S. federal, contractor, architect, engineering and other services end markets, had another great year. Deltek had nice gains in both our government contracting and private sector end markets, gaining share at each and driving considerable SaaS adoption. Deltek continues to benefit by having favorable secular tailwinds. Turning to Vertafore a great year, exceeding the EBITDA expectations that we outlined at the time of the acquisition in 2020, Vertafore had impressive demand from their enterprise customers as they continue to partner with P&C agencies to tech-enable their customer acquisition, quoting and underwriting workflows. Notably, Vertafore had record quarterly bookings in Q4, which only adds to their ARR momentum. Amy, to you and your team, congrats to a phenomenal start as part of the Roper family. During the fourth quarter, we combined CliniSys and Sunquest to create the largest global lab diagnostics and informatics business. Together, the businesses will begin integrating their go-forward product roadmaps and innovation efforts and operate under the CliniSys brands. Also of note, both CliniSys and data innovation set records by a wide margin for bookings activity in 2021. Finally, as it relates to this group, we recently completed the acquisition of Horizon Lab Systems, which adds public health, water and environmental laboratory cloud-based software to the global CliniSys product portfolio. Aderant continues to be a solid performer for Roper, taking share in ‘21 from our primary large law competitor. Also, starting in 2020 and gaining momentum last year, Aderant is seeing a meaningful shift towards our cloud offering, helping drive substantial increases in their recurring revenue stream. Finally, we completed a small tuck-in acquisition, American LegalNet, which will extend and enhance Aderant’s court docketing software solution. Finally, Strata’s combination with EPSI has worked out wonderfully well. Today, Strata partners with about half of the U.S. acute care hospitals to help them manage forecast and plan their operating and capital expenses and continues to extend both market share and product cross-selling. Looking to the outlook for 2022 in this segment, we expect mid single-digit growth that is driven by our ARR or recurring revenue momentum, making for a solid year for this segment. And with that, let’s turn to our next slide. Turning to Page 12, as a reminder, the financial performance for this segment, as well as in X2, MAS and PT are shown on a continuing ops basis. 2021 revenues in our Network segment were $1.34 billion, up 11% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins clocked in at 51.1% for the year. The exceptional organic growth performance in this segment was underpinned by very strong growth in recurring revenue, which is roughly 80% of the segment’s revenue. The growth in margin performance in this segment was broad-based and well distributed. As we dig into business-specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight match businesses were just amazing throughout 2021. Market conditions were very favorable, which led to record levels of network adds especially on the carrier side. More so, the leadership team at DAT did a terrific job scaling infrastructure to meet the market’s demands, while maintaining aggressive new product innovation efforts, which led to higher ARPU as well. Over the longer arc of time, our freight match businesses continue to be well positioned to enable the digitization of the spot freight markets. Also, all of our other businesses in this segment saw increasing levels of ARR growth throughout the year, which helped setup for a strong 2022. To highlight a few, Foundry did a terrific job of continuing to extend their product advantage by using AI ML to automate tasks within the media and entertainment postproduction workflows. In addition, Foundry has benefited by the continued increases in content creation budget for streaming, animation and theatrical releases. iTrade, our network food supply chain business, rebounded very nicely in 2021 following the 2020 COVID shutdowns. In addition to benefiting by foodservice reopening, iTrade was able to meaningfully expand their food supply chain network in 2021. iPipeline continues to benefit from the tech enabling of the life insurance distribution model and our long-term care GPO, pharmacy software and home health analytics businesses continue to benefit from the post-COVID recovery and the longer term demographic aging of America. Finally, both RFID and Inovonics had good years, improving in the second half, especially within their healthcare applications. Turning to the full year outlook, we expect to see high single-digit organic growth for this segment, driven by a combination of strong recurring revenue momentum and favorable market tailwinds. Please turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 13, revenues in our MAS segment were $1.56 billion, up 8% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for the segment were 33.1% for the year. Again, these results are on a continuing ops basis. Before getting into business specific details, across this segment, demand continues to be very strong. As previously mentioned, product backlogs ended the year at record levels. Also, each of these businesses, are navigating the current supply chain environment. Strong demand at Neptune continued throughout the year, picking up in the back half as Neptune’s end markets continue to fully reopen. Also, the Neptune team continues to do a great job, innovating their core product offering both in terms of the metering and the meter reading technologies. These innovative product advances helped set Neptune up for many great years. Verathon was very good last year. Remember, they had a great 2020, which was aided by COVID-related demand, but Verathon’s 2021 was meaningfully higher than 2019, roughly 40% larger. Over the last 2 years, this team has innovated like crazy, going from zero to number two in the U.S. single use bronchoscope market, launching several new Video Laryngoscope products and developing a new ultrasound core platform. Perhaps more importantly, in 2021, Verathon’s largest product offering is now a mission-critical consumable medical product. Our other medical product businesses, especially NDI and CIVCO, recovered nicely in 2021 as healthcare spending started to normalize. These businesses entered 2022 with record levels of order backlog. Demand across our industrial businesses rebounded with better end market and capital spending conditions, but somewhat hampered by supply chain challenges. As it relates to the 2022 guidance, we expect to see high single-digit growth for this segment, underpinned by strong demand and backlog levels, but somewhat constrained by the current supply chain environment. Net-net, we expect a very strong year for this group. Now, let’s turn to our final segment, Process Tech. As we turn to Page 14, revenues at our Process Tech segment were $499 million in 2021, up 8% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 32.2% for the year. These results are also reported on a continuing ops basis. The story here is we saw improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment and very strong demand in the second half. Cornell continues to perform well for us. This is partially based on market conditions, but also based on Cornell’s product innovation as they’re seeing very nice demand tick up for their IoT connected pumping solutions and the share gains they’re enjoying as a result of their niche focused go-to-market teams. Similar to that of our MAS businesses, these businesses are being impacted by supply chain challenges, but continue to navigate well through the issues. Across this group, the business has exited 2021 with record levels of order backlog. As we turn to the outlook for 2022, we expect mid-teens organic growth based on strong levels of backlog and solid market conditions. Now please turn to Page 16 as we’ll walk through our 2022 guidance. For 2022, we’re establishing adjusted DEPS guidance on a continuing ops basis of $15.25 to $15.55 Underpinning this DEPS guidance is organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% and a tax rate of 21% to 22%. As we said throughout the call, we feel quite bullish about our 2022 based on our 2021 recurring revenue growth and the momentum it carries into this year with strong product demand and the record levels of order backlog. As you look to the first quarter, we’re establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.63 and $3.67, again, on a continuing ops basis. Now some concluding comments, and we’ll get to your questions. As we turn to Page 17 and our closing remarks, we want to leave you with the same three points we started with: We had a strong ‘21; we are set up very well for a solid 2022 organic performance; and we have substantial M&A capacity heading into the year. As it relates to 2021, our revenues grew 19% to $5.8 billion and 9% on an organic basis. EBITDA grew 22% to $2.2 billion, which was 38.2% of revenue. Free cash flow grew 19% to $1.8 billion, 31% of revenue and 82% of EBITDA. Finally, we exceeded our deleveraging plan by reducing net debt by $1.7 billion and ending the year with 3.1x leverage. As we discussed throughout this call, we are set up to have a very strong 2022. Our 2021 software recurring revenue growth provides significant momentum heading into the year. Additionally, our product businesses had and have broad-based demand and record levels of backlog. Taken together and further aided by favorable market tailwinds, we expect to see 6% to 8% organic revenue growth this year. In addition, we have reloaded our balance sheet and continue to have a highly active and engaged pipeline of M&A opportunities. We anticipate having about $5 billion of available M&A firepower over the course of 2022. As a result, we have a high level of conviction that will continue our double-digit cash flow compounding in 2022. And with that, let’s open it up to your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And today’s first question comes from Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Maybe we can start with the impact of Omicron supply chain, etcetera. It did come up a couple of points, parts in your prepared remarks. But in the scheme of things, it did not sound as impactful as we’ve heard from other companies. So not surprising in measurement and process, it did have an impact. So could you size there, what might have been either revenue pushouts, because I’ve seen record backlog, so that implies that you might not be able to get some of the product out the door. And then just confirm on the software side, what the impact is, if any. I mean it’s probably limited site access, maybe some landing new logos and so forth. But just how did that play out? And what’s the expectations in the first quarter when, hopefully, we get to some sort of normal level of activity and access.
Neil Hunn: Yes. So Deane, I’ll start, maybe going in reverse order. And then there is a handful of [Technical Difficulty] there is no supply chain fortunately. So there wasn’t an impact in any meaningful – not meaningful way on our software businesses. The businesses have been working remote for the last 2 years. And so that’s a complete – the Omicron spike, if you will, is a complete non-factor. Bookings activity, as we talked about, was super strong in Q4 there. So that’s our view there. On our product businesses, yes, it was – it was more about supply chain, less about Omicron and shutdown of facilities. I mean it happened for a week here or there, not an impact really in the quarter and the issue on supply chain, as you hear it from some of the companies, it’s not one thing. It is really sort of a hornet’s nest of small things. One of the nice things about our organization, as you know, is we’ve got 25 or so product businesses and 25 groups of people focused on their bespoke issues, and they did a very nice job in Q4 working through that. A little bit of margin pressure in those businesses at the gross margin line in Q4, just sort of expediting and sort of pulling things forward to be able to meet demand. A couple of other things I’d say, and I’ll turn it to Rob, is as we look to 2022, those issues haven’t abated. We expect them to sort of lessen in the second half, but still persist to some degree. And the final thing is the companies, their teams have done a very nice job of sort of taking the price taking price and offsetting going forward in 2022, the impact of the inflationary environment associated with this. Rob, anything you want to...
Rob Crisci: Yes. That’s right. So yes, it clearly impacts the product margins a little bit. You saw that in the fourth quarter. We’re assuming Q1 is similar and then a little bit of gradual improvement throughout the year on margins for the product businesses.
Deane Dray: And did you size or can you size any missed revenues or was it not meaningful?
Neil Hunn: It was not meaningful.
Rob Crisci: Yes, I mean, we’re at record backlog levels as all other businesses are that sell products. And so we will benefit from that moving forward. But we wouldn’t say it was meaningful to sort of revenue in the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Christopher Glynn at Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Christopher Glynn: Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Christopher Glynn: So congrats on rebooting the balance sheet there. Just wanted to ask about the pipeline, how are you seeing the toggle between what’s currently most actionable versus decision trees around holding fire? I think sometimes you’ve talked about don’t do the very good at the expense of great.
Neil Hunn: Well, I want to make sure we understand your question. I mean I think the – in terms of the opportunities that are out there for acquisitions, I mean, it is – there’s a lot of opportunities. There are always a lot of opportunities. The pipeline activity is full, there’s lots of discussions, diligence. We’re always in some phase of diligence at some point, something. The thing that we said for a very long period of time, the 10 years I’ve been here, is that we continue to invest through cycle. We’re a permanent home. We’re trying to find the very best businesses we can find because we’re going to own them over a very long arc of time. And that the compounding effect overwhelms any sort of short-term value. We’ve been here and there and compounding overwhelm that in sort of a cycle benefit. That feature is going to have perfect visibility on what the future holds, which we don’t claim to have.
Christopher Glynn: That’s great, it’s helpful. Thanks. And then you’re pretty bullish kind of even multiyear comment on Neptune. I’m just wondering if you could drill in there a little bit and what you’re seeing specifically for 2022 for Neptune and the particular compounders into 2023, ‘24?
Neil Hunn: Yes. I think it’s – we’re not going to – we try not to give guidance on the forward year for a specific business. But you’re right, the commentary and our view of Neptune and what Don and the team’s doing there is quite bullish. It’s rooted in three things, principally around the products, both the meter itself going more static from mechanical, the reading technology going from – going to more cellular. And then once you have both of those elements in place, then Neptune becomes more of a data business, helping its customers sort of navigate the data and work with their customers in a more meaningful and impactful way. Importantly, on the first two, especially the meter technology itself, we think we have some very real proprietary advantages in the static ultrasound technology that we’re using, both on the residential side and the commercial side that we are quite bullish about going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Allison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. Just want to talk, I know you mentioned strong freight matching. Obviously, I’m a little biased here in terms of what I cover. But when we think about that, obviously, the network challenges has put a huge spotlight on that market. And I know DAT certainly supports some of the new entrants. But how are you managing a, I would say, that risk in terms of the viability of some of the new entrants that are coming on to your system or utilizing your system, as well as competitive dynamics? Any thought there?
Neil Hunn: Yes, so DAT, as you know, is wonderfully positioned and spot freight market is one of two primary competitors or players that help match the shippers and the brokers and the carriers, I should say. And as you think about the tech enabling of the brokerage model, DAT sits right in the center of that and as their business model in future is only aided by that. In terms of the tech-enabled brokers, they are just – all brokers are becoming tech-enabled. There are some that are native tech-enabled and some that are sort of migrating their business models, all of which are customers and all of which were helping do their job to sort of do their business with less human interaction to more computer-driven connectivity.
Allison Poliniak: Got it, that’s helpful. And I guess, leaning on that competitive dynamic, meters, obviously, the growth and opportunity certainly attracts new innovation there. Do you know any change in competitive dynamics or things that you’re concerned around? Obviously, Neptune seems like it’s growing quite nicely for you. Any thoughts on that?
Neil Hunn: Is your question, Allison, on the competitive dynamics on DAT and freight matching or on Neptune?
Allison Poliniak: Freight matching originally first. But this one will be...
Neil Hunn: Okay. Yes. So on – no, so hey, we – it’s something that we pay very close attention to. The team at DAT has a very open ecosystem. They partner with many folks, and so we pay attention to all of that. But this is a very vibrant two-sided scaled network. Scale matters a ton here. And I mean, when I say a ton, I mean it’s a huge rate limiter for competition. You’ve got to have scale on both sides of the network to be effective, very hard, not impossible but super, super hard to create de novo. But we pay attention to that and any competitive activity, and we need to think about how to counteract that. On the Neptune side, hey, I think this is over a very long arc of time when we think that the metering technology can render a market share advantage. I’ll remind you that Neptune seemingly every year for 20 years ekes out 50 to 100 basis points of market share. I think we’re clearly the leader in the North American water utility metering space, and we’ll just – we expect that will just continue eking out a little bit of share gain each year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just wanted to dial into the EBITDA margin guidance a little bit, so I think you are guiding sort of EPS up around 9% for the year at the midpoint, sales up maybe 1 point or 2 lower than that right now. So when we’re looking at EBITDA margins, are we expecting those to be up sort of 20, 30 bps or so at the midpoint? And any color around those product businesses, just to understand in measurement and analytics and in process. Are we expecting margins up much for the full year as a whole in those two divisions?
Rob Crisci: Yes, so we’re – we have EBITDA leverage, right, on organic growth around 40%, which is generally pretty normal. So that on a full year basis I think you’re right. We’ve got total EBITDA margins up a little bit sort of embedded in the guidance. Software businesses are, right, 44% EBITDA for application, 51% for network. We’ve got that about the same year-over-year, very stable there. You’re growing, you’re investing, we have very nice organic growth in those businesses this year. So that will drive a lot of organic EBITDA growth at those margin levels. And then – and as we mentioned on products, it’s a little bit lower margins in the first half of the year, similar to Q4. And then I think we’ll benefit from a lot of the price cost things that we’ve been doing as we get to the second half, margins get a little better. So I think on a full year basis, again there, margins are pretty flat year-over-year, maybe a little bit of improvement as we get to the second half.
Julian Mitchell: That’s helpful. And just my follow-up question on the free cash flow outlook, very good performance last year with sort of 82% conversion out of EBITDA, anything you’d call out sort of one-timeish helping that and how should we think about cash flow conversion in 2022?
Rob Crisci: Yes, so there were a couple of things that helped us this year for sure. I mean, we had great working capital performance, which we view we’ll always have, especially when you have highly negative net working capital of revenue minus 15%. That drives great conversion. In ‘20 in particular, there were some tax benefits that we benefited from. And so the 80% to 83% conversion is great. We generally feel like if we’re plus or minus 80% conversion, and that’s kind of where we start and then we see sort of the one-off items that happened year-over-year. So that’s – we always sort of I think we’ll be around 80% and then sometimes it ends up a little bit better.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Davis: Good morning guys.
Neil Hunn: Hi. Good morning.
Scott Davis: Neil, can you talk a little bit about what you are trying to accomplish with combining CliniSys and Sunquest? And is – and how do you really combine businesses like that? Do you – can you integrate that – can sales, for example, be combined? Certainly understand any other functions, but just trying to think about holistically how that helps you guys out.
Neil Hunn: Yes, I appreciate the question. Good morning. So first, I would say, as we have gone through just our portfolio work over my time as being CEO, there is – we have tried to see if there are a little – small pockets where it makes sense to put businesses together. We did it a couple of years ago with Seaboard and Horizon that are both doing very similar things into the education market. And now with CliniSys and Sunquest, as you know, they are doing literally the same thing, just Sunquest historically in the U.S. and CliniSys across Europe. So, in terms of this integration, there are still going to be three core technology platforms for the lab information, U.S., UK and global. But this integration is really all about then sharing the innovation from that going forward. The microservices or service-oriented architecture allows us to do that. The first three in the Q are advanced analytics that helped the laboratorians do their job and make better decisions. The acceleration of anatomic pathology, which is the tissue side of the lab into the cloud and then increasingly, the adoption of molecular or genetics into the lab space. So, this is more about the product integration, if you will, on a go-forward basis. Go-to-market teams remain very similar as they are selling bespoke into their very specific geographies. So, the go-to-market motion is the same. Final thing I would say here is the teams are totally geeked up about this internally. There is a ton of enthusiasm and excitement as the team is now 1,300 people, 12 countries, 21 languages and is part of the largest lab diagnostics business in the planet now.
Scott Davis: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Just a quick follow-up on that, are the customer needs essentially the same when you go around the world now, Neil, when you think about that product offering?
Neil Hunn: The customer needs are remarkably similar in that you have the fluid side of a lab, the tissue side of the lab and increasingly, the genetics or molecular labs. And then the integration of the ologies, if you will, rarely now do you have a genetic test without some sort of tissue or blood or urine test. So, how do you integrate the pathologies is a major theme. So, those things are very similar. And so if you are a lab in the UK, in NHS or your lab in the U.S. or a lab in France or Spain or wherever it is, the needs are very similar.
Scott Davis: Okay. Good luck guys. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Rob Jamieson: Hey. Good morning. This is Rob on for Joe. I just had a couple of questions about like Foundry and iPipeline. You called out some of the secular tailwinds behind these businesses. And I was just curious how much – you have good penetration there already, but how much is the growth and further gains that you are going to see in the future is from like new enhancements or upgrades to the existing platforms or products that you offer there. And is there like an opportunity to maybe increase like spend per customer or deepen that wallet as you go forward?
Neil Hunn: So, the answer is it’s I will try to generalize them because your question around Foundry and iPipeline, totally different markets, obviously, in media and entertainment and life insurance distribution sort of workflows or channel. Both businesses have net retention well north of 100%, right, which tells you that you have an appreciating asset from your customer base. You are selling more into your customer base in any given year. That is largely a result of two things. One is your customers are growing with you. They are growing, so you are growing with them. And then two, you are selling them more value, more things. So, you are correct in that. In Foundry’s case, a lot of their growth has been – they are going to sort of ride the tailwinds of the 8% to 12% of content spend that happens in media and entertainment between streaming animation and theatrical. But then the workflows in post production are remarkably tedious and manual. And so as we automate those workflows, those are modules that we can sell to monetize the investment in innovation that we are doing there. Similarly, conceptually at least at iPipeline, this is a business that we bought it several years ago. It was all about and the strategy continues to be what they call straight-through processing. How do you get a – from a quote of life insurance to underwriting life insurance, how does that happen with minimal to no human touch. And so being able to do that and automating those workflows is a huge task. But as you do that, you are creating a ton of value for the distribution channel and you are able to monetize that through the product.
Rob Jamieson: That’s great. Thank you very much. I will pass it on.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Rob Mason of Baird. Please go ahead.
Rob Mason: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Neil, you have spoken in the past about a heavy focus on software in the M&A pipeline. And I am just curious, given what we have seen around public market valuations there over the last couple of months, how private market valuations have responded? And is it requiring more patients on your part if a reset of some sort needs to happen there? Just what you are seeing in private markets?
Neil Hunn: Well, we are always patient. So, we should start with that. And so it’s we are patient and disciplined relative to the asset selection, the value that we ultimately try to transact at. I will tell you my experience here at Roper for a decade and the experience that predate Roper by 15 years sort of being in tech M&A for 20 years or 25 years now is the private markets always lag by some quarter or two quarters or three quarters, the public markets relative to valuation swings to the extent they are meaningful. And so that’s what our – my personal expectation would be to the extent that we have structurally lower public valuations for software businesses, then it might take a couple of three quarters for those to filter into the private markets. Unclear if that’s the case, right. And so we will be patient. I also said earlier that our analytics, we always are reviewing the analytics, and our analytics suggest that it’s better to buy a great business at the market clearing price at the time and let the compounding sort of begin rather than it is to try to see if you can wait for that asset and save 0.5 of a turn of EBITDA…
Rob Crisci: Or by a lower quality business.
Neil Hunn: Or by a lower quality business, that’s right. But we will be, and we always are patient.
Rob Mason: Understand. And just as a follow-up, you had commented on Vertafore’s EBITDA coming in above plan for the year. I am curious, two questions, I guess. What drove that? And then when you purchased Vertafore, you talked about a mid-single digit growth revenue expectation there, but believe that could be conservative over time. And I am just – as you have owned the business a year, what needs to happen to move that mid-single digit growth perspective higher?
Neil Hunn: Yes, so the overdrive on the earnings was they just – they did a better job of managing our costs and the way mix came in on a revenue line. So, it was – and also a little bit is that first part of the year, they are still having a hard time of spending money sort of with COVID. So, it’s a little bit of that. But more importantly, the momentum that the business left, I mean record bookings in Q4, and just the feedback that we are getting from the customers at the enterprise level did a nice little tuck-in that helps them get some customer acquisition on the lower side of the P&C agency space. That’s doing well in the first few weeks. In terms of – you are right, we did – the expectation when we bought the business is the mid-single digit growth business, it still very much is that. Is there an upside to high-single digits over a long market time, we would like to hope so. Amy and her team have a very well-articulated data-driven, market-driven outside-in strategy and there is some execution associated to sort of inflect the growth rate a bit higher, but right now, we will hold at mid-singles and want to see Amy and the team put post a few years of better performance where we call it high singles.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Steve Tusa: Hi. Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Hi. Good morning Steve. Good to hear you.
Steve Tusa: Can you give us some color on first quarter organic trends just what the guidance for first quarter organic growth? And then, sorry, I just wanted to clarify on EBITDA margins. What do you guys expect for the first quarter kind of on a year-over-year basis?
Rob Crisci: Yes. So, we have the 6 to 8 organic revenue guide for the year. It’s really pretty consistent throughout the year. For the first quarter, the software businesses are a little bit stronger, given all the ARR momentum we have coming out of Q4. And then the product businesses are a little bit lower, given some of the supply chain challenges we have spoken about. And then I think, as I mentioned, the EBITDA margins we have for Q1 are flat sequentially to what we had in Q4 for the company.
Steve Tusa: Okay, great. And then just on that kind of comment about double-digit free cash flow growth in compounding continuing is that kind of a high level of guide for the year? And could you – will you be growing free cash flow double digit without another acquisition, or would that take another acquisition to grow?
Rob Crisci: Yes. So, I mean it’s not a guide. It’s what we do here at Roper. So, I think if you take our organic and you take capital deployment and you look at us over any given year or certainly over a couple of years, we are double-digit compounder. So, I think that will continue to be the case. And we have got a lot of firepower for M&A that will certainly help that number here in the next couple of years.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Brian Lau of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Brian Lau: Hi. Good morning everybody. I just wanted to talk about the network software and systems guide. So, high-single digits in ‘22 after a couple of strong mid to high teens quarters in 3Q, 4Q, kind of meaningfully ahead of the historic trends of like mid-single digits. Is this the new medium-term kind of algorithm for the segment? And is this where you think application software can get as you kind of continue the SaaS transition there as well?
Rob Crisci: Yes. Well, just historically, TransCore was in that segment, right. So, the software business have a little bit higher organic growth profile than the old segment did with TransCore was a little bit of more up and down given on various projects. And I will turn it over to Neil.
Neil Hunn: Yes. I mean I think it’s – that work has been strong. It’s been strong across the board as we highlighted this quarter, much of 2021. There was like super strength at our Freight Match businesses, both in North America and Canada. So, that super strength to moderate a little bit, while the rest of the portfolio improves a little bit, but it’s – this has been a great couple of years last year, this year for network. Application software, the businesses are great. I think that all of them sort of are very steady eddy mid-single digit growers. As we transition more of a revenue stream away from perpetual into recurring over a long arc of time, is there a chance that, that can inflect a little bit higher, I believe so, but it’s going to take a few years to do that.
Brian Lau: Okay. Great. And then just on measurement, could you just clarify what the growth would look like in ‘22 without supply chain constraints versus that kind of high-single digit outlook? Thanks.
Rob Crisci: Hard to quantify.
Neil Hunn: It’s very hard to say. I mean I think probably in the same ballpark.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from Brendan Luke with AllianceBernstein. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. As I look at application software and network software and systems, just speaking to the recurring revenue growth, would you say that sort of active SaaS transitions are a drag on the top line here, or we sort of entered the phase where they are driving top line growth disproportionately?
Neil Hunn: So, I appreciate the question. I love talking about this one. So, we believe in the application software business that the transition to SaaS is a net growth driver. You have two opposing factors going on. You have – as you transition new clients to the SaaS recurring models. Obviously, that’s the classic J-curve as it relates to perpetual. We are in the year, and that’s a bad guy. Over the long-term, that’s a great guy because you have a higher level of recurring revenue. Offsetting that is, as we have these businesses that have very large installed bases of customers that are paying maintenance, and in fact, it’s about $900 million a year, plus or minus, is what our maintenance stream is across our businesses. That maintenance gets transitioned to SaaS at a, I don’t know, call it, 1.7 to 2.5 uplift. And so it becomes a net growth. That growth driver in year tends to offset the negative J-curve if that makes sense. So, we believe it’s a net growth driver over a long arc of time. We also just – and as a postscript on that, we don’t force the migration on our customers. The customers are pacing the migration to the cloud. So, that’s why this is going to take 5 years plus to maybe 10 years to sort of fully migrate to the cloud because we are going at the pace of our customers. But it is – that’s our view on the net growth driver as we migrate to the cloud.
Unidentified Analyst: Excellent. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Alex Blanton of Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please go ahead.
Alex Blanton: Hi. Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning Alex.
Alex Blanton: I didn’t see in the slides your working capital to sales ratio. What is that doing…?
Rob Crisci: We just have a slide. It’s very consistent mid-teens negative, right. It’s – it is just part of the model now, especially post TransCore when the working capital went away. So, we are not updating it each quarter, but it’s the same as it was last quarter, minus 13% is where we sit today.
Alex Blanton: Minus 13%?
Rob Crisci: Yes, sir.
Alex Blanton: Yes. Okay. Thank you. On TransCore, when do you expect to complete that?
Neil Hunn: We expect to complete it in this quarter.
Alex Blanton: This quarter. So, are you – and you probably can’t answer this, but are you waiting to get that money to make an acquisition?
Rob Crisci: No.
Neil Hunn: No.
Rob Crisci: No, we have the ability to make acquisitions before the cash comes in.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded, and we thank you all for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-22 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us, as we discuss the third quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We've prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now, if you'll please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now, please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. During and subsequent to the third quarter, Roper signed definitive agreement to divest TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy businesses. Results for these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all period presented. Unless otherwise noted, the number shown in this presentation is in continuing operation basis.  For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consist of the following item: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense and lastly income tax restructuring associated with our pending divestures. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website.  And now, if you'll please turn to Slide 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We're looking forward to sharing with you the details of our solid quarter performance, as well as summarizing the acceleration of our portfolio transformation. As we look at the sequence of our call this morning, we'll start with our quarterly highlights and our recent divestiture activity. I'll then turn the call over to Rob who will share the details of our financial performance and our bridge to continued operations. I'll then walk everyone through our segment by segment performance and our outlook for the balance of the year. As usual, we'll leave plenty of time to talk to you all of your questions towards the end. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, this was another quarter of solid operational and excellent financial performance. On a continuing ops basis, we grew revenue, EBITDA and DEPS north of 20% in the quarter. It is important to highlight and characterize the underlying strength of these results. Revenue on an organic basis grew 12% in the quarter. End market and customer demand was very strong across our portfolio within both our software and product businesses. Importantly, our software segments were strong operationally with 10% growth in one segment and 17% in the other. Our software businesses recurring revenue grew low double digits in the quarter, highlighting the underlying strength, stability and increasing quality of a revenue base. To remind everyone, about 80% of our software revenues are recurring in nature. It's also worth noting that our 2020 acquisition cohort, led by Vertafore, continues to perform very well. As it relates to our product businesses, like most other companies we, are experiencing supply chain and logistical challenges. But the businesses nevertheless performed very well during the third quarter. As mentioned, customer demand was very strong throughout the quarter and backlogs are up over 50% versus last year. Given this strong operational performance, we continued our disciplines deleveraging of our balance sheet with net debt at 3.5x trailing EBITDA. Also, we are improving the outlook for the year, which we'll detail later in the call. Earlier this morning, we announced two new additions to our Board of Directors, Irene Esteves and Tom Joyce. The addition of Irene and Tom to our Board is part of our long-term board refreshment process. Both are tremendous additions to our board. Finally, we've been active over the last few months working to accelerate the transformation of our portfolio through the announced divestiture of three businesses. Let's turn to the next slide Page 6 to walk through those details and highlights. Next slide please. During the last several weeks, we entered into definitive agreements to divest three of our businesses: TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy, the last of which we announced this morning. We agreed to divest TransCore to ST Engineering for $2.68 billion. In our view, this is the right time and the right buyer for TransCore, given their forward strategy and growth outlook. Taken together, we're divesting these three businesses for $3.15 billion, or about 20x this year's EBITDA. Following the completion of these deals, Roper will be improved. We will have a higher quality portfolio characterized by having higher proportions of recurring revenue, a higher organic growth profile, and be significantly more asset light. Finally, we are and will be very active in deploying these after-tax proceeds. Together with our internally generated cash flow, we will have about $5 billion of available M&A firepower to deploy between now and the end of 2022, none of which is included in our current financial outlook. Our enterprise will be even further enhanced once we complete this activity. Before I turn it over to Rob, I wanted to take a moment and highlight Roper's ability to govern, build and approve businesses over the long term. As part of these transactions, we are retaining our DAT and Loadlink network software businesses, which are purchased together with TransCore in 2004, and we are retaining our CIVCO Medical Solutions business. Given we do not usually get clean book-ins to transaction activity, this provides a unique opportunity to talk about the business building that occurs within Roper. Specifically, just after the acquisition of TransCore, we established DAT and Loadlink as standalone businesses with independent strategies and management teams who operated within Roper's governance and incentive system. Over the course of the last 15 years, these businesses have consolidated freight networks, continuously innovated their product solutions, built go-to- market capability and grown revenues high single digits on a compounded organic basis.  Similarly, the retained CIVCO Medical Solutions business has grown high single digits on organic basis over the last 15 years as well. During this period of time, CIVCO Medical Solutions has continually innovated their products solutions, including the recent gel-free ultrasound products, and fundamentally restructured their go-to-market strategy. At Roper, we buy great businesses and provide an environment and incentive system where they get even better over the long arc of time. Now let me turn over to Rob to walk through the details of our financial performance.
Rob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 7. On this page, we will review some Q3 financial metrics on a basis that includes the discontinued operations in order to compare our Q3 results to our previous guidance on an apples-to-apples basis, including the businesses now classified as discontinued operations, we generated $1.621 billion of revenue and $602 million of EBITDA. Total DEPS was $3.91, which exceeded our Q3 DEPS guidance of $3.80 to $3.84. Free cash flow for the quarter was $431 million, down 2% versus prior year; year-to-date free cash flow is now up 29% through three quarters. Now turning to Page 8. Here we'll review some of the key income statement metrics on a continuing operations basis. Revenue increased 22% to $1.463 billion. Q2 organic revenue increased 12% with strong growth across all four reporting segments led by 17% organic growth in our Network Software segment. EBITDA increased 21% to $558 million, net earnings grew 24% to $384 million, and DEPS also grew 24% to $3.60. Next slide. Turning to Page 9. This slide will update you on the latest installment in our successful deleveraging story. Year-to-date, we have reduced our net debt by nearly $1.3 billion and our total debt reduction is now $1.8 billion since completing the last of the 2020 acquisitions approximately one year ago. We continue to benefit from our excellent cash conversion as nearly $2.3 billion of total EBITDA we generated over the last four quarters has converted to $1.94 billion of free cash flow, representing EBITDA to free cash flow conversion of 85%. At the end of September, our net debt to EBITDA has decreased to 3.5. We are on track to be near 3x by the end of 2021 and therefore, well positioned to return to capital deployment even before accounting for the divestitures. The proceeds from the divestitures further amplify our capacity with $5 billion-plus available for deployment through 2022, as Neil highlighted earlier. Next slide. Moving now to Page 10. A quick look here at how the divestitures meaningfully improve our working capital position moving forward. This page repeat the working capital numbers we showed last October and adds a Q3 '21 column that shows the enterprise including the removal of the three businesses being divested, we are now at negative 12% net working capital to revenue compared to negative 6% in the same quarter last year, and negative 3% back in Q3 2019. Divesting TransCore reduces our net working capital by approximately $200 million with the majority coming out of our unbilled receivables balance. This structurally lower net working capital positions us very well for continued high cash conversion moving forward. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to cover the segments.
Neil Hunn: Thanks Rob. Let's turn to Page 12 and walk through our application software segment. Revenues in this segment were $603 million, up 10% on organic basis. EBITDA margins were 44.4% in the quarter. Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for this segment increased approximately 10%. This recurring revenue strength is based on strong customer retention, continued migration to our fast delivery models, cross-selling activity and new customer adds. Across this group of companies, the financial strength was broad. To highlight a few businesses, Deltek, our enterprise software business that serves the US federal contractor, architect, engineering, and other services end markets had another good quarter. During the quarter, demand was particularly strong in Enterprise GovCon and construction end markets. Importantly, during the quarter, Deltek also had success at the top end of market with their cloud or SaaS solutions. Vertafore, our agency management cloud software business focused on P&C insurance agencies also had a nice quarter with very strong new bookings and nice expansion activity in some of their largest customers. Aderant, our legal software business continues its momentum and market share gains, as we talked about last quarter; Aderant is gaining momentum for their SaaS solutions this quarter, setting a record for SaaS bookings activity. Consistent with the theme of this segment, PowerPlan was strong as well both in terms of new bookings and adds to their recurring revenue base. It's nice to see PowerPlan's refocus strategies start to pay dividends. As relates to our healthcare IT businesses, Strata, the data innovations and CliniSys were rock solid in the quarter. For Strata, their recurring subscription based software solutions continue to perform well and grow nicely. Strata's integration of EPSi is on track and nearly complete. The customer base continues to demonstrate excitement for this combination. Finally, CliniSys continued to gain market share in the UK lab market, and has been established as one of the four strategic IT partners for the NHS. As we turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect organic revenue growth to be similar to that of the third quarter as recurring revenue growth rates are expected to remain strong. A solid quarter here for sure. And with that, let's turn to the next slide. Turning to Page 13. The financial performance for this segment, as well as next two MAS and PT are shown on a continuing ops basis. Revenues in our network segment were $343 million, up 17% on organic basis and EBITDA margins remained very strong at 51.6% in the quarter. The software businesses in this segment are now greater than 90% of the segments revenue. Our NSF software growth was broad based and driven by organic recurring revenue growth of approximately 17%. At the business level, our Freight Match businesses both in the US and Canada continue to be solid growers. As reminder, our Freight Match networks are critical and necessary elements to help organize and transact the trucking, shipping spot markets. Strength in our businesses has been on both sides of the network, brokers and carriers with continued strength in the quarter on the carrier side of the network.  In addition, these businesses had improving revenue per customer ARPU, as the value of the network continues to increase with higher levels of network activity. Foundry, our media and entertainment software business which enables the combination of live action and computer generated graphics to be combined into a single frame demonstrated continued recovery and growth in the quarter. Worth pointing out is Foundry's continued commitment to product innovation. And the recent release of their AI enabled news features that allow for more automated workflow steps within the video compositing process. Our businesses that focus in and around the US Long Term Care markets, MHA, SHP and SoftWriters did particularly well in the quarter. iTradeNetwork, our perishable food supply chain, network business had a nice quarter as bookings growth was very strong and demonstrates this followed recovery in their end markets. Finally, we saw growth across the two product businesses within the segment, rf IDEAS and Inovonics Products with particular strength in our healthcare end markets. As we look to the fourth quarter outlook, we expect to see low double digit growth in this segment again on a continuing ops basis. Please turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 14, revenue in our MAS segment was $392 million, up 9% on organic basis. Organic growth in this segment excluding Verathon was again north of 20%. Notably, this is the last quarter for the very difficult Verathon COVID comp and we expect Verathon return to growth in Q4. EBITDA margins for this segment were 32.4% in the quarter; the EBITDA margins in this segment were consistent with our expectations, but lower than prior year due to Verathon's extraordinary prior year quarter, and the cost impacts of certain businesses navigating their supply chain challenges. Again, these results are on a continuing ops basis. Before getting into business specific details across this segment demand can be characterized as being very strong. The demand was across all businesses and across both capital and consumable products. Product backlogs are up over 50% as compared to a year ago. Our businesses, each of which was impacted by supply chain challenges navigated through the quarter. As relates to individual business performance, Verathon coming off unprecedented demand for their intubation family of products a year ago is roughly 40% larger today versus 2019. The momentum within this business continues given the larger install base of intubation capital equipment, which enables recurring considerable pull through volumes. In addition, Verathon is experiencing impressive growth in their Bronchoscope product family and sustained growth across their BladderScan ultrasound franchise. Our other medical product businesses accelerated nicely in the quarter with particular strength at NDI and CIVCO Medical Solutions. Strong demand at Neptune continued in the quarter. Neptune's end markets continue to open up and improve but have not fully recovered, especially in the northeast US and Canada. Demand across our Industrial Businesses was robust as well and performance was strong but somewhat impacted by supply chain challenges. For the fourth quarter, we expect low double digit organic growth for this segment. This is based on continued encouraging market conditions both in medical and industrial markets and easing prior year comp for Verathon. Now let's turn to our final segment Process Tech. As we turn to Page 15, revenues in our Process Tech segment were $124 million, up 16% on organic basis, EBITDA margins were 31.6% in the quarter. These results are also reported on a continuing ops basis. The short story here is we're seeing improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment and strong demand. Both orders and backlog were up approximately 50% in the quarter versus a year ago. Recovery in our upstream oil and gas business is accelerated in the quarter. Cornell continues to perform well for us. This is partially based on market conditions but also based on Cornell's product innovation, as they're seeing very nice demand pick up for their IoT connected pumping solutions. Similar to that of our MAS Industrial businesses, the businesses in this segment are being impacted by supply chain challenges but continue to navigate through these issues. As we turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect high teen organic growth based on improving market conditions. Now please turn to Page 17, where I'll highlight our increased outlook for 2021. Based on strong year-to-date performance and expected continued momentum, we're establishing full year 2021 guidance on continuing ops basis of $14.08 to $14.12. As you read down this table, you will note that the full year DEPS impact for the businesses being divested is $1.18. If you combine this with our newly established continuing ops guidance, you will note we are raising our full year outlook on apples-to- apples basis by $0.26 in the low end and $0.10 on the high end. As relates to the fourth quarter, we're establishing again on continuing ops basis guidance in the range of $3.62 and $3.66. Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. As we turn to Page 18 and our closing summary, our third quarter was a solid quarter from both an operational and financial perspective. Simultaneously, we undertook significant work to further the transformation of our business portfolio. Revenue, EBITDA and DEPS grew 20% plus, organic revenue was up 12%. Across our enterprise, end market and customer demand was strong in terms of software, product capital items and consumables. Throughout the quarter, our product businesses navigated through the market based supply chain challenges. Given all of this, we're able to increase on an apples-to-apples basis our outlook for the full year. We also continue to deleverage our balance sheet by $1.8 billion since the 2020 acquisitions with net leverage now coming in at 3.5x trailing EBITDA. As relates to the strategic governance of our enterprise, we're excited to be announcing the addition of Irene and Tom as new members of our Board of Directors. As part of our long-term board refreshment strategy, these two new directors will complement our existing directors, and help enable Roper to continue our track record of long-term cash flow compounding. Over the last decade, we have worked to enhance the quality of our portfolio. To this end, recently, we took actions to meaningfully improve the quality of our portfolio by agreeing to divest TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy. Once complete, Roper will be a better version of Roper, will have higher proportions of recurring revenue, higher organic growth prospects, and be significantly more asset light. In addition, we expect to have roughly $5 billion of capital available to deploy between now and the end of 2022. And as it relates to our M&A pipeline, it is and always has been characterized as having many high quality opportunities. So we're clear, we're 100% back on offense when it comes to our capital appointment portion of our strategy, and have fully resumed our usual process oriented and disciplined M&A activities. And with that, let's open up to your questions.
Operator: We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
DeaneDray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Hey, good morning, Deane.
Rob Crisci: Good morning, Deane.
DeaneDray: Hey, look, when I look at free cash flow, organic revenue growth, recurring revenue, everything checks the boxes, and there's a lot of moving parts this quarter and I really appreciate all the reconciliation of previous guidance versus revised with a divestiture. So just set that aside and the first question I want to ask is for Neil, to help put in context, these recent portfolio moves. And I don't want to parse your words, but the slide says accelerating a portfolio transformation. You're not saying optimize, you are not trimming at the edges, but you are making some sizable moves here in a cluster. And it just begs the question, what is the strategic transformation? Is it more just making Roper a better Roper? Or is there a more sizable change in portfolio composition coming in what the timing might be. Thanks. We'll start there.
NeilHunn: Yes. Thanks, Dean. So hey, the - it's all about Roper being a better version of our self, our strategy, as you know and most people listening know, for the last 20 years has been fundamentally based on improving the quality of our enterprise, historically, that's been characterized as being more asset light or recently, it's not just that, but increasing mix towards recurring revenue, increasing mix towards higher and slightly higher organic growth businesses. So that strategy has been in place and will remain in place, nothing's changed there relative to these three transactions is really a result, these three are result of really two different decisions. Zetec was really an opportunistic situation with a strategic buyer, who offered a compelling price. And it was just made sense, in our view, for our shareholders to let that go to that buyer and reduce a little bit of cyclicality and exposure to the Zetec end markets. As it relates to CIVCO Radiotherapy and TransCore, those were -- while they're independent decisions, the result of a single process, which was our sort of our new and revised sort of deep strategic review of all the businesses, we do this with each business on a rolling sort of three-year basis. The CIVCO Radiotherapy and TransCore reviews were late last year, early this year, and we just felt, given their future growth prospects, which are interesting and likely robust, but also capital intensive. In both cases, we're going to just be a sub optimized with us as an owner, you overlay that where the valuations will get for the businesses, the three together roughly 20x this year just made sense from all vectors for us.
DeaneDray: Is there just to circle back for the timing? And just like what's ahead, how far down the road are you on this optimization? Are there other bigger pieces coming? What kind of timing should we expect? 
NeilHunn: Yes, I think the, again, it's, I wouldn't -- I would call it the acceleration of the transformation. Transformation has been slow and evolutionary over 20 years, as we've gone from 40% cyclical to now, 10% or 15% cyclical, going from more asset intensive, less asset intensive gone from products to software. I mean, this has been an evolutionary approach, and we expect that to continue.
DeaneDray: Good. Well, just, I really appreciate the specifics you provided each one of these divestitures makes sense. You're getting good valuation for them. So, kudos to you guys. And then the second question, and this feels more like some that would ask at an Analyst Day, but just it jumped off the page here on your board additions. Today, adding Tom Joyce from Danaher, Irene from CFO of Time Warner. I've presented to your board last November, I've got an appreciation for how high powered the group already is and how hands on they are. Talk about the partnership with the board, the dynamics, especially at this stage of the evolution of the portfolio. And what were the priorities for the board is in our at this time?
NeilHunn: Yes, appreciate the opportunity, any opportunity to talk about our board because it is absolutely and undeniably a strategic asset for our business. The board, we highly engaged with five times a year, three days each time. So it's a board that works hard. They enjoy working hard, it's a board and that amount of time that we spend, it's not just a series of presentations where there is space to have conversation, deliberation, challenge one another, and then form a point of view on the forward direction of our enterprise, highly collaborative group, but one where people express their points of view open and freely. So it's a great environment. Also in governance, there's a refreshment process that goes with that, the Board Chair that became the Board Chair at Brian's passing, Will Prezzano just aged off the board. And we have a sort of that requirement to refresh the Board and we're super fortunate to have Irene and Tom join us. Irene will bring just a tremendous - she's most recently professionally as a executive at Time Warner, but a long track record in financial institutions just a very astute and financially savvy executive understands risk and risk management and also a very experienced Board member at this stage in her career. Tom, this will be his first public, outside public company board. Everybody here listening knows Tom very well, but just the combination of what he's done in his 30-year career at Danaher, combination of business building and capital deployment leader development is core to what we are all about. And I think both will just bring tremendous new thoughts to our boardroom as we continue to evolve and build our business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
AllisonPoliniak: Hi, good morning, guys.
Neil Hunn: Hey, Allison.
AllisonPoliniak: I just want to talk of the CRA metric. Obviously, core to your M&A strategy, and I suspect going forward, but with, some of that asset intensive business coming out, elevating Roper's on CRA. I guess one is that, is it more challenging in terms of pool of potential properties that you want to acquire? And, I just maybe any thoughts on does that CRA metric relative to Roper kind of shift going forward? Just any color there?
NeilHunn: Yes, cash return for us is our North Star, right? It is how we not just -- it just not only guides our capital deployment strategy, it guides every operational decision in the business. It defines for us, for instance, what good organic growth is versus just growth at any cost, right? It's how you do - in CRA for those that aren't intimate with it is really just a measure of business quality. Do you have a cash flow relationship with your customer, if you will, we're able to provide value, capture value for that and have an underlying business model that doesn't require a lot of assets to deliver that value. That's what cash return is, it is our North Star, will continue to be our North Star. It's just -- it's core to our culture here. Allison, in terms of your question about the number of targets, it mathematically yes, it's the number of targets are fewer as we're looking to buy companies that are have CRA that are higher than our existing, but it's not a limiter to our strategy, right? There's a vast ocean of software, informatics data-enabled business models that are out there that we've been fishing in for the last 10 years. And it's not a practical constraint for our capital deployment strategy.
AllisonPoliniak: Got it. That's helpful. And then just a quick question on measurement and analytical solutions at core without Verathon, obviously, up 20%-plus. But then you talked about EBITDA, some headwinds there, one being Verathon, but the other being supply chains. Is that just a headwind in terms of growth? Is it cost you can pass through, just any incremental color there to help me reconcile that?
NeilHunn: Hey, I'll start and I'll pass over to Rob. And so first, I would say, our businesses more broadly, like most businesses, maybe around the world, certainly as country over the last 20 years have built their supply chain for optimize on the lowest cost and less so on resiliency, a nice thing that our businesses did, starting a couple years ago, is build some resiliency with the China sort of tariff situation. So that was a precursor that helped us a bit for us relative to the headwinds, yes, it was growth was limited a bit, certainly across all of our product businesses. And then also the choice that our businesses made when there's an opportunity to either expedite apart or go into a spot market or an alternative source for a part and pay incrementally bit more, they did that. And so there's a little bit of gross margin headwind, hard to notice, in a macro sense, but a little bit of headwind on GP percentage, and then certainly some impact on the revenue side. Rob, if you want to add something?
RobCrisci: Yes, I just, about 25% of that MAS segment are the industrial businesses. And so that's where you see some of this and, I think we mentioned earlier that backlog is up 50% so that, we're -- we have great orders, and that bodes well for the future. But yes, I think what Neil said they're spot on.
Operator: The next question is from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.
TrishGorman: Hey, good morning. This is Trish Gorman on for Julian, just maybe following up on that last question regarding the supply chain constraints. Can you just talk more about what your assumptions are kind of embedded in for guidance for when those might be.
RobCrisci: Yes, so we're not expecting that they're going to ease really anytime soon. So we're expecting what we saw in the third quarter similar to what we'll see in the fourth quarter and then as we get in next year, we'll update that next quarter, but we're continuing to build backlog, the customer relationships are great as Neil said we're expediting wherever we can to get products to customers. And so I think long term it's a great story; short term, it's hard to say what's going to happen.
TrishGorman: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And then just maybe a follow up kind of broader. We've been seeing industrial companies paying anywhere from 30x to 100x EBITDA for software assets now. And so does Roper think you'll have to pay this kind of price too or can it still buy software assets for 20x EBITDA or less as it did with Vertafore. Thanks.
NeilHunn: Yes, appreciate the question. Certainly valuations for higher quality software businesses are high. They've been high for a while they remain high. It's, I think I said a couple quarters ago it feels like this. They may be stabilizing at a level I think that still may be the case. But that level is very high. That said Roper buys businesses that are tried and true. The competitive forces and market are observable, the market growth is concerned -- is observable, the forward growth outlook is diligence able and understandable and the growth drivers can be clearly modeled. When you get those businesses that are in small markets that are leaders that have mid to high single digit organic growth and are 30% to 40% plus EBITDA margin businesses, those trade in that we call it circa 20x maybe 18x, maybe 22x. But they're sort of in that zone. And that's where we think that will continue to play and focus.
Operator: Next question comes from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.
ChristopherGlynn: Oh, yes. Thanks. Good morning. So given the comment that the number of targets is not a practical constraint, and I appreciate repeating that, which we've heard previously. I'm wondering if the expectation is actually to, at least replace the divestiture earnings and EBITDA in fairly short order? And can you under head of receiving those proceeds in terms of your negotiations with agencies and such?
NeilHunn: Yes, so appreciate the question. So first, we said it in the prepared remarks, it's on the slides is worth mentioning, we take the proceeds from these through transactions added to our cash flow we're generating in our current balance sheet leverage, there's about $5 billion of M&A firepower between now and the end of next year. So that's all good, the balance sheets in good shape, or as we mentioned we are super active in the M&A markets. But we always have been and always will be patient and disciplines, right? I mean, this is every deal matters; we're buying these businesses with the very long term in mind to never sell them. So you have to buy the very best asset you can find. And sometimes that takes time. So I'm not, we're sort of putting out this mathematical marker of $5 billion, but I would not associate any specific timeframe with that. It's just, we're patient, discipline focused, but active in the M&A markets.
RobCrisci: And I would say we do have flexibility in terms of the timing on when that capital is deployed. I think you have to wait, for the proceeds to come in the door. But as Neil said, we're going to be very, very disciplined and we don't feel like we're rushing anyway.
ChristopherGlynn: Okay, and just wanted to dive into the backlog of 50% plus that the MAS segment, curious the play of medical versus industrial and how Verathon factors into it.
NeilHunn: So it was the backlog was up over 50% in both MAS and Patterson. I'll certainly turn over to Rob here in second but the backlog was strong at medical products, Verathon Northern MMI. It was strong at Neptune and it was strong at industrial so --
RobCrisci: Yes, it's very broad based. It really is across all the businesses, and again, that's getting a lot of orders in and then being able to get the products out the door.
ChristopherGlynn: Okay, last one for me any estimate on the after tax and impact of the $3.15 billion?
RobCrisci: Yes, I think we want to wait until we get the deals closed to comment on that. I mean, there certainly will be some tax leakage. But we'd rather wait till next year, we get the deals closed and then we can give you a good number.
Operator: Next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. 
JosephGiordano: Hey, good morning, guys. So does this mean that I, we're not going to be able to ask you guys about New York City deal and the --.
RobCrisci: You can ask.
RobCrisci: We're under contract to not disclose a lot of details about that going forward.
JosephGiordano: It will be sadly missed. Yes, I just wanted to ask on Neptune. A lot of like kind of different things being said out there in that market. Can you talk about where that business is this year? Like is that business growing this year? Or is it still down? How much did it decline last year? Just kind of curious to see what's really going on in that metering market right now.
NeilHunn: Yes, so I'll give you a little bit of color and turn over to Rob. So it's for Neptune this year will be like really close to '19. Just from a size perspective that absolutely is growing this year, in the very short term, we're actually we believe it's hard to measure in the very short term but the reports from the company Neptune as we picked up a little bit of market share this quarter because we are able to deliver product on a much shorter lead time than some of the people we compete with. The thing that's about the market itself, the markets are opening, but nowhere close to fully recovered, especially in Canada and less so but certainly not open in the Northeast United States in the US Northeast. Final thing I'd say about Neptune is the strategy here is, I mean, it's very clear, and it appears to be working, if you will, having traction around the strategy on the product with the static meter product that were introduced to the market, the way we read the data off the meter. And importantly, now the software and analytics that play that Neptune is developing, right? What do you do with all that data once you capture it off the meter in a more frequent basis? So it's the strategy is certainly got traction in the marketplace, and the business is growing, and they have record levels of backlog as we sit here at the end of the quarter.
JosephGiordano: Can you just remind me how much of the product at Neptune are you guys manufacturing, like in house and how much is contract?
NeilHunn: It's virtually all in house. I mean, certainly there's -- it's a supply chain, and there are certain pieces that come but between the two facilities at Neptune it's a vertically integrated business.
JosephGiordano: Okay. And then my last question and I promise next quarter I'll ask software questions. So this is like the first one. But the process got, is that I mean, it's slightly less growth expectation than previous, is that just supply chain limiting your ability to deliver or does the market change at all?
NeilHunn: No, 100% supply chain related across all the businesses and incrementally the markets more favorable. We talked about the backlogs but the obviously you know that the US rack markets more favorable energy prices more favorable the project work at CCC is going well. So yes, it's all supply chain related.
Operator: Next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.
AndrewShlosh: Hey, good morning, guys. It's Andrew Shlosh on for Jeff. How are you? Sorry about that. I was on mute. So just Firstly, you said Vertafore was strong in the quarter and really good bookings there. Are you able to quantify the growth on a sales basis?
RobCrisci: Yes, it's right on track with the numbers that we laid out last year, when we acquired the business; they're doing very, very well.
NeilHunn: Yes. And it's, at the time of the acquisition, we said it was a mid single digit organic grower. And it's, that's where it is.
AndrewShlosh: Awesome. No, that's great color. And the other thing I was kind of thinking about, so measurement and analytical solutions was up 9%, organic, 20%, organic, excluding Verathon, we talked a little bit about the growth there and I know revenues significantly above 2019 levels, how do we think about the growth going into 2022?
RobCrisci: Yes, we will guide 2022 in beginning January, February, when we announced earnings, so I think the trends are very, very good. And all those businesses, we talked about the movement at Verathon to these, to the equipment that has been critical to the COVID fight, and now it's become more common. And so that leads to consumables. And so I think it's a great long-term growth story at Verathon, all those businesses. But we'll wait till next year to give you the numbers on that.
NeilHunn: The one thing I'd add that is we're going to carry a very high backlog going into next year, there's momentum and demand, we'll see to the extent that it's going to be, we expected to carry through for the full year, but it'll certainly start strong.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Blanton from Clear Harbor Asset Management.
AlexBlanton: Hi, good morning. Yes, very interesting quarter. I wanted to ask about the organic growth, it was 12% average and 10% for application, 17% for network, 13% -- 9% for measurement. 16% for process, these are numbers that are way above historical rates of organic growth for this company. And it's really stunning. And one comment that I had from our group this morning was, well, last year was depressed. So that really won't continue. Could you comment on that how much of that growth is just due to a depressed base, if any, and do you expect these kinds of things to continue this organic growth rates.
RobCrisci: Yes, so these businesses when we acquire them, I think we're pretty consistent. They're mid single digit organic growth businesses, sometimes they're high; we work hard to get them from mid to high. I think if you look at the double digit, certainly last year was down low single digits, and now we're up double digits. And so if you take the sort of the two year run rate, you're in that mid to high single digit organic, which I think is the natural run rate for those businesses, which we're always looking to accelerate.
AlexBlanton: Yes, well, mid to high single digit is somewhat above what Roper did for many, many years, which was more like the mid single digits, not the high. So there is a -- there was a pickup.
NeilHunn: Yes, Alex, it's the, yes, it's Neil. I mean, I would say a couple things there. I mean, we certainly, we're going to carry momentum from this year into next year, so if you just look across the portfolio, I think next year, we haven't done the guidance yet, it'll probably be a little bit better than trend, trend sort of mid single digits over a long arc of time, next year might be a touch better than that. We'll see we do our guidance next year. But what we're trying to do from our -- for three years now, as CEO, we've been trying to increase the organic growth rate of this business of the portfolio, through a very structured, process oriented way that focus on strategy, the execution of strategy and really building world class teams and team effectiveness. And we're starting to see that sort of work in pockets of organization that's a bit more mature. So the final story chapter hasn't been written on that story for us yet. It's got another several years to play out, but certainly encouraged by the early signs.
AlexBlanton: Yes. Second question is on the outlook for acquisitions. You mentioned a very robust pipeline in the new release and your earnings release, which was unusual, you don't usually comment on the pipeline and that location. But could give us a little more color on that, what kind of timing can we look forward to be super acquisitions right away in the next year, or it's going to be later on and so forth. 
NeilHunn: So I'll give you a very generic answer on the timing, which is, it's the pipeline always has a lot of deals in it, the pipe, we are able to because of our approach, filter that pipeline, where it's high quality, and we are spending our time on sort of high impact things. But the deal business, you can have a deal where you think you're the winner until you're not at the finish line. And so, the timing is always a little bit subject to a handshake, if you will, between the buyer and the seller. It's not just a one way thing. And so we're going to be very patient and very disciplined. And we don't feel any sense of urgency to get this $5 billion deploy just for the sake of getting it deployed, we're going to do it in the way we've done for the last 20 years. And so it's hard to handicap the specific timing of when anything would happen, but we're going to be busy at work trying to get it done.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Mason from Baird.
RobMason: Yes, good morning. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to speak on the software businesses a minute; the growth was very good to see across both application software networks. And Neil sprinkled throughout your commentary was frequently the strength around SaaS bookings. And I know you have several businesses where you have SaaS conversions underway. So just given the overall strength that typically you start to, there's a little bit of headwind, as you're converting some of those on-prem businesses over to subscription. I'm just curious what that -- what is that headwind and buried in the growth that you're putting up?
NeilHunn: Appreciate, Rob, the opportunity to talk about this, just to level set, everybody that the vast majority of the revenue on the network side of our business is already in the cloud and/or recurring, it's 90 plus percent. So the vast, vast majority of the cloud conversions, Rob, what you're talking about, shows up in our application software segment, and is centered at Deltek, Aderant, PowerPlan, little bit at Seaport. As you mentioned, when you convert, the punch line of all this is that we convert we believe it's a modest net growth driver not a headwind. The reason it's a growth driver is you have two competing factors. One is the bad guy, you referring to the J curve. When you instead of selling a perpetual deal, you sell a recurring revenue deal in the year of that deal. That's a bad guy, right? Because instead of getting 100% of revenue, when you ship the perpetual license, you get some small percentage of that depending on what month the subscriptions booked.  However, what counters that are when you have these large installed base of customers that are paying annual maintenance on their historical perpetual, we're actively lifting and shifting those customers to the cloud. And when you do that, because what you're doing for them carries more value, right? You're on the current release, you're managing the infrastructure, managing cyber security, you're managing your -- there's a greater value proposition, you're able to charge a higher recurring revenue base. And so the uplift on the recurring overwhelms the negative headwind on that upfront sale, and that becomes a modest net growth driver for us. Happy to talk about that offline in more detail, if you'd like.
RobMason: And is there a timeframe that you're thinking about where these conversions, largely complete themselves for the existing businesses.
NeilHunn: It's going to be -- it's elongated. In our case companies are, can make a decision, they can either, like some companies do just force it, like we're taking you to the cloud this year. And it becomes the company's perspective. In our case, we're allowing our customers to pace that. So our customers are the ones who are saying I'm ready to go to cloud and when we're going to meet them where they are. So in that case, it's going to be an elongated period of time, certainly five plus years, it might be as long as 10. So it's going to be a slow throttle to get fully cloud enabled.
RobMason: How do you think about balancing, I guess, internal investment into support both sides of that?
NeilHunn: Yes. So it's the way that the architecture of as our companies have become more cloud enabled the architecture allows them with a service orientation, to make investment, one investment and deploy it to both platforms. So it's not really an either or it's an and.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.
SteveTusa: Hey, guys, good morning. Yes. On the organic, you guys didn't provide an update to the 7% plus, I know like there's some noise around disc ops and continued ops what is that number now for the year, I mean, I can kind of add up all the segments, but again, there's a lot of noise in the numbers, just, moving stuff around. So just an update to that 7% plus now on the continuing ops, for the year, total count?
RobCrisci: Yes. I think on a continuing ops basis for the year is the eighth on an apples-to-apples basis, the seven is unchanged.
SteveTusa: Okay, got it. So then why next year, if you kind of have some supply constraints and stuff, kind of pushing revenue in the next year, and this ridiculously strong backlog? Why would that slow next year? I mean is there any particular reason why that would slow?
RobCrisci: I mean I think we'll guide next year in January and after we do all of our business reviews, but I don't see a reason why there should be a challenge.
SteveTusa: Okay and then just one last one just on margins. What do you expect kind of this year for these continuing ops, kind of roughly EBITDA margin range and then in particular for MAS total company and then MAS EBITDA margins just for baseline for next year?
RobCrisci: So I think the total company margins are we sort of just gave you Q3, Q4, similar and like I said, we'll guide next year, after we do all of our reviews.
SteveTusa: Okay, and then MAS, any comments there?
RobCrisci: You mean application software?
SteveTusa: Yes. The MAS margin just where you're going to end up for the year in the fourth quarter?
RobCrisci: Yes, I mean, I think generally similar to the third quarter.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-23 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies conference call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the second quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense. And now if you please turn to Slide 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. This morning, I'll provide the highlights, of which there were several for the quarter. Rob will then discuss our P&L performance and balance sheet metrics and then turn it back to me to review our segment details, our increased outlook for the year and our concluding comments. As usual, we'll leave plenty of time to talk through all your questions towards the end. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, we delivered an excellent second quarter with strength across all four of our segments. Specific to the financial metrics, which Rob will detail shortly, revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow all grew north of 20% in the quarter. Also during the quarter, we are encouraged to see the post-pandemic recovery gain momentum and broaden at the same time. Specifically, not only did we experience continued improvement across virtually all of our businesses, the strength within each business was broad. Our software businesses, which now make up over 55% of our revenue base, performed very well in the quarter. Specifically, on an organic basis, we grew our Application Software segment 9% and grew our software businesses within our NSS segment 10%. Across our software businesses, we saw the acceleration of our recurring revenue growth, approximately 80% of our software revenues, from mid singles to high singles and a solid recovery of perpetual license activity. Relative to our product businesses, a very similar pattern: acceleration and recovery of our consumables revenue sources and very nice ordering patterns for our capital equipment-type products. In addition, our 2020 acquisition cohort led by Vertafore is performing very well. Importantly and consistent with our guidance over the last three quarters, we continue to delever our balance sheet at a rapid pace, now under 4x debt to EBITDA. And finally, before handing things over to Rob, just a great first half to the year. Our teams have performed magnificently, thanks to each and every team member at Roper. Given the great start and the positive momentum across our enterprise, we are once again increasing our full year guidance. Rob, let me hand it over to you.
Rob Crisci : Hey, thanks, Neil, and congrats again on the Lightning winning the Stanley Cup. Turning to Page 6, looking at some of the key financial highlights for Q2. Total revenue increased 22% to $1.59 billion, another record for any Roper quarter. Q2 organic revenue growth was 7% versus last year's comp of minus 3%. All four segments performed well, with strong organic growth across our portfolio of software and product businesses. Q2 EBITDA grew 26% to $579 million, and EBITDA margin increased 110 basis points to 36.4%. Adjusted DEPS was $3.76, 28% above prior year and also above our Q2 guidance range of $3.61 to $3.65. Free cash flow was $409 million, up a very strong 30% versus last year. As a reminder, last year, we adjusted our Q2 cash flow to account for the income tax payments that were deferred from Q2 to Q3 due to 2020 delayed tax deadlines. Net working capital was negative 8%. We continue to benefit from Roper's transformation to a high recurring revenue, majority software business model that is structurally designed to consistently drive high cash conversion. Lastly, we have been laser-focused on debt reduction this year after last year's record capital deployment, and we continue to make great progress on that front with an additional $375 million paid down in Q2. So in summary, an excellent second quarter, wrapping up a very strong first half for Roper. Next slide. Turning to Page 7, an update to the charge we introduced last quarter showing our rapid deleveraging. Through the first half of 2021, we have now reduced our net debt by nearly $900 million, raising the total debt reduction to approximately $1.4 billion since completing the 2020 acquisition late last year. Our debt reduction, along with the meaningful contributions from our 2020 acquisitions, has enabled us to rapidly lower our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, from 4.7 to 3.8 in only six months. We expect this downward trend in leverage ratios to continue moving forward, which positions us well for a return to meaningful capital deployment in the coming quarters. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to discuss our segment performance.
Neil Hunn : Thanks, Rob. Let's turn to Page 9 and walk through our Application Software segment. Revenues in this segment were $592 million, up 9% on an organic basis. As a reminder, this segment grew 1% organically last year, aided by strong results from our lab software franchises that were critical to the COVID response. EBITDA margins were 43.7% in the quarter. Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for the segment increased approximately 9%. This recurring revenue strength is based on strong customer retention, continued migration to our SaaS delivery models, new product cross-selling activity and new customer adds. To that end, the non-recurring organic revenue in this segment grew 9% as well. Specific to business unit performance, Deltek, our enterprise software business that serves the U.S. federal contractor, architect, engineering and other services end market had an excellent quarter. Their strength was rooted in large-scale GovCon customer wins and expansion activity. Deltek was further benefited by the recovery in the professional services end market. Terrific job by Mike and the entire team at Deltek. Aderant, our legal software business, continues its momentum and market share gains. In addition, and encouragingly, their customers are beginning the journey of migrating to Aderant's cloud solutions. This will take many years for the entire customer base to migrate, but will result in increased customer intimacy and higher levels of recurring revenue. CliniSys and Data Innovations continued their long string of market share gains in the quarter. And CBORD grew based on strength in healthcare and, in particular, their higher education product offerings. Finally, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions continue to perform very well, both at Vertafore and EPSi. As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect high single-digit organic growth for this segment based on strength in both our recurring and non-recurring revenue streams, a solid quarter here for sure. And with that, let's turn to our next slide. Turning to Page 10. Revenues in our Network segment were $459 million, up 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 42.5% in the quarter. Our software businesses in this segment, about 65% of the revenues were up 10% on an organic basis. This growth was broad-based among our software businesses and driven by organic recurring revenue growth of approximately 11%. At the business level, our Freight Match businesses, both in the U.S. and Canada, continue to be solid growers. As a reminder, our Freight Match networks are critical and necessary elements to help organize, interact and transact the trucking, shipping spot markets. Strength in our businesses have been on both sides of the network, brokers and carriers, but with particular strength in this quarter on the carrier side of the network. We also continue to see nice organic gains at ConstructConnect as our network enables commercial construction planning and bidding to occur in a more efficient and transparent manner. Foundry, our media and entertainment software business, which enables the combination of live action and computer-generated graphics to be combined into a single frame, recovered nicely in the quarter with particular strength in the mid-market. Importantly, we continue to see very strong customer retention levels across each and every one of our network software businesses. The strong growth in our software businesses was partially offset by project delays in our TransCore New York congestion pricing project. These delays are based on pending federal environmental approvals. While we all believe the federal approval will be granted, the approval process to complete our work is taking longer than originally anticipated. Conversely, TransCore tag demand appears to be normalizing for the balance of the year. As we look to our second half outlook, we expect to see high single-digit growth in this segment: the growth to be underpinned by strength in our network software businesses, which we expect to grow in the low double-digit range in the second half of the year. Based on the New York TransCore project pushing to the right, we now expect about $40 million of this project's revenue to push out of the second half of the year and into 2022. All in all, high single-digit organic increases in this segment for the balance of the year. Please turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 11, revenues in our MAS segment were $397 million, up 7% on an organic basis. Organic growth in this segment, excluding Verathon, was north of 20%. EBITDA margins for the segment were 33.4% in the quarter. Verathon, coming off unprecedented demand for their intubation family of products a year ago, is roughly 40% larger today versus 2019. The momentum within this business continues given the larger installed base of intubation capital equipment, which enables recurring consumable pull-through volumes. In addition, Verathon continues to experience impressive growth within their bronchoscope product family and the recovery in their BladderScan ultrasound product group. EBITDA margins in the segment were lower due to Verathon's extraordinary prior year quarter and the associated margin benefit. Our other medical product businesses accelerated nicely in the quarter based on hospitals and hospital equipment OEMs resuming normal levels of activity. Demand at Neptune was very strong as well. The Northeast opened up and the balance of the country experienced normalizing levels of activity. Our industrial businesses were strong. As I mentioned in the opening, the strength was buoyed by improving consumables activity and solid returns to capital equipment spending. Our businesses within this segment have done a nice job navigating the difficult supply environment. In supply environments like the one we are in right now, our decentralized, highly nimble organization tends to perform quite well. This quarter was no exception. For the balance of the year, we expect double-digit growth for this segment. This is based on broadly improving conditions both in medical and industrial markets and easing prior year comps for Verathon. Now let's turn to our final segment, process tech. As we turn to Page 12, revenues in our process tech segment were $140 million, up 13% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins improved by over 500 basis points to 32.8% in the quarter. The short story here is we're seeing improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment after over nearly 2 years of declines. Our upstream oil and gas business has started to recover nicely. Cornell continues to perform well for us. This is partially based on market conditions, but also based on Cornell's product innovation as they're seeing very nice demand pickup for their IoT-connected pumping solutions. And finally at CCC, we're seeing the resumption of previously deferred projects and the demand for field services to come back online. Also, greenfield bidding activity is back in full swing, especially on an international basis. As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect 20%-plus organic growth based on improving market conditions and continued easing comps. Now please turn to Page 14, and I'll highlight our increased guidance for 2021. Based on strong first half performance, improvement to our recurring revenue growth rates and improving market conditions, we are raising our full year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $15 and $15.20 per share. Of note, our prior high-end DEPS guidance was $15, now the bottom end of our range. Also, we're increasing our guidance notwithstanding pushing roughly $40 million of the TransCore New York City project into next year, providing everyone a good sense of how strong the balance of our portfolio is performing. Our full year organic growth is expected to be 7% or a touch higher. This full year growth outlook implies low double-digit organic growth in the second half. Our tax rate should continue to be in the 21% to 22% range. For the third quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $3.80 and $3.84. Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. Turning to Page 15 and our closing summary. This is a very strong quarter for our enterprise with software revenues growing on an organic basis, 9% in our Application Software segment and 10% for our software businesses in our NSS segment. In addition, the recovery pattern is characterized as gaining momentum and being broad, strength in product and software, strength in recurring and nonrecurring. We performed very well virtually every financial metric, growing 20% plus in revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. EBITDA margins expanded by 110 basis points and free cash flow increased 30% to $409 million in the quarter. As promised, we continue to delever our balance sheet, reducing debt by $375 million in the quarter and by $1.4 billion since completing our 2020 acquisitions in Q4 of last year. As we look forward, positive momentum continues to build. Over the last decade, we have worked to improve the quality of our portfolio to be more software based, resulting in enterprise having higher levels of recurring revenue and be increasingly asset-light. In addition to having this improved quality within our business portfolio, we're seeing our recurring revenue growth rates improve from mid singles to high singles. Finally, our businesses will benefit from improving end market conditions. Given each of these: improved portfolio quality, improving recurring revenue growth rates and improving market conditions, we expect to see double-digit organic growth in the second half of the year. Also, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions continue to perform very well and solidly contribute to, and improve the quality of, our enterprise. Given all of these factors, we're increasing our outlook for the full year. Finally, while we continue to focus on deleveraging our balance sheet, we also remain committed to our long-term capital deployment strategy. To this end, our pipeline of M&A candidates is active, robust and has many high-quality opportunities. As our balance sheet becomes more offensive towards the end of the year, our active pipeline of M&A targets will enable us to resume capital deployment in our usual process-oriented and disciplined manner. And with that, let's turn to your questions.
Operator: We will now get into our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Deane.
Rob Crisci: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Maybe we can start on measurement and analytical. The point is there were some soft spots on the margin side. I know you called out supply chain is -- how much of an impact was that higher input costs? And then for Verathon and no really tough comp. And -- but -- and sadly, it looks like this latest COVID surge is going to put this product back in demand for ventilators. So just -- are you ready for that capacity? And just start there, please.
Rob Crisci : Yes, sure. Good morning, Deane. Yes, on margins, really, it's driven by Verathon and just that exceptional quarter last year. And so with the decline this year, a little bit lower. There's certainly some supply chain things going on everywhere like every other company, not really a meaningful impact for us. And I'll let Neil talk about the Verathon question.
Neil Hunn: Yes. And again, just to echo what Rob said, the margin pressure there is just Verathon was amazing last year and they were deleveraged, as you expected, this year. In terms of the capacity there, the company is perfectly fine. I mean they ramped up last year in a way that was unprecedented. And as we look back and just we're sort of amazed at how that company operation was able to do that. I would also just highlight for Verathon, it was -- the demand there was a little bit driven by ventilators, but a lot a bit by the anesthesiologists and the people who do the intubations wanting to do it at an arm's length away for general surgery as opposed to when you do a direct intubation, you have to visualize the vocal cords right on top of the patient. Our product allows you to do it, if you monitor and be arm's length. And so it's less, the demand, it's less about the ventilators and more about just a better, more effective way to do an intubation, so much so that the total percentage of intubations done now versus 2018 or 2019, using video assistance, we believe, is permanently meaningfully higher. So it should be a long-term tailwind for the business.
Deane Dray: Great. And then just second question for us is the deleveraging, which has been happening faster. I know the target has been to get to the mid-3x leverage, and it looks like you could be there next quarter. And notably, you talked about back playing offense. Can you talk about the funnel? It's interesting you're using a new data point of just sizing the funnel at $150 billion as oppose to talking about the number of potential assets. So just flesh out what the funnel looks like and the assumption that you could be getting to that mid-3 sooner than originally projected. Thanks.
Neil Hunn: Yes. So relative to the leverage of getting there, I mean, we -- essentially, when we did the larger transactions last year, we thought we'd be in strike zone or being back in the M&A business sort of late this year into early next year. And I think we're just on track. And I may be pacing a touch ahead, but cash flow has been amazingly strong in Q4, Q1 and Q2, which has certainly helped. Relative to the pipeline and the characterization of pipeline, it is just -- there's a lot of great things. But for my 10 years here, there's always been a lot of great things at any moment in time to buy. I would remind you and everybody that we do a lot of work well ahead of when assets are actually for sale. And I'll remind you that Vertafore, we met with Amy and the team 18 months before we ultimately bought the company. And so we do a lot of early spade work, understanding the businesses, understanding the management teams and tracking. And that's the activity we've done this year to sort of position us for late this year and into next year deploying capital.
Deane Dray: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Christopher Glynn: Yes, thanks. Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Christopher Glynn: Curious about Aderant's share gain, that's been going on for some time. Just curious how you see the duration on that dynamic.
Neil Hunn: Yes. I appreciate the question about Aderant, a business that we don't get a chance to talk about very much. And Deane and Chris and Raphael and the whole team there has just done really a remarkable job. I think the success here at Aderant is a combination of a great leadership team in a great market with a great product, but also complemented by our government system that focuses over success -- over a long arc of time. So the share gain from our principal competitor, as you mentioned, has been happening for essentially since we've owned the business. There is just a couple of years of inventory left in terms of those large law firms that have yet to make a decision on their enterprise system between us and our primary competitor, but that's been a known issue for three or four years now that inventory is going to run out in 2023, 2024. And so Aderant goes to work on their product offerings. They go to work on their cloud solutions. We've done a couple of bolt-on acquisitions in that business to where the -- if you will, the divot that existed in 2023 or 2024 relative to the growth rate four or five years ago. Now this no longer exists in any capacity, and we believe Aderant will grow -- easily grow through the divot because of the product portfolio, the cloud migration and really the long-term planning and execution of that team.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. A lot of information there. And just curious if there's any particular second half mix dynamics across the segment we should be mindful of.
Rob Crisci: Not really. I think we laid out each of the segments and what we see for organic for the second half. It's really great results we're expecting. And Q3 and Q4, relatively similar margin dynamics. The leverage, as you know, as the businesses start to grow, especially the industrial and the processing, is always very strong on the rebound. And then the software businesses are always strong no matter where you are in any sort of a cycle. So we feel really good about the second half.
Christopher Glynn: Sounds good. Thanks, guys.
Neil Hunn: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: The next question comes from Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Allison Poliniak: Hey, guys, good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Allison Poliniak: I want to keep on the Application Software segment. I know a pretty strong outlook in the second half in terms of that high single-digit organic growth. But how -- I know both recurring and the non-recurring revenue are starting -- in the non-recurring more specifically is starting to grow. How do we think of those dynamics in the second half, particularly just given, I would think, easier comps at least on the non-recurring side? Any thoughts there?
Neil Hunn: Yes. I think so, Allison. Let me tackle that sort of recurring and non-recurring broadly in Application Software. And if I don't exactly land in your question, then circle back to us on that. So the second half for organic recurring is strong, right? So the dynamic there is that in the middle of COVID, recurring was more, generally speaking, across our enterprise, mid singles, it's ticking up to high singles. The reason for that is twofold. One is that you have more additions, product and customer additions today, both perpetual and SaaS related that drives recurring. But then also, you have our software businesses that were most negatively impacted by COVID now being coming out of the ditch. Think of like in Application Software, think of CBORD for instance. So not only did they have good bookings performance in the quarter, but they saw a bit of a tick up in their transactional revenue stream in Q2. And that will continue even more in Q3 and Q4 as kids get more on campuses and K-12 and higher education.
Allison Poliniak: No, that's helpful. That's helpful. And kind of a similar dynamic with Measurement & Analytical, businesses like Neptune, you noted some recovery there. Is there a way to kind of say relative to what you would think is normal there in terms of that volume? Are we far off of it? Are we kind of there? Or a little bit above? Just trying a sense of any pent-up demand that's coming out of that.
Neil Hunn: So in Neptune, we're returning to normal. So I think this -- we believe that 2021 revenue will be equal to ish 2019, maybe a touch higher. So in terms of actual activities, June for Neptune, I believe, was their highest bookings month in the history of the company. The guys are nodding their heads. So the actual current momentum is great. I don't think we expect that to sustain itself for the balance of the year, just get more normalized as the Northeast is open. Canada is not open quite yet, we expect it to come online here in 3Q, in 4Q, but that gives you a sense of what's happening at Neptune.
Rob Crisci : And I'll just add to that, as you talk about MAS, you also have the medical products businesses that aren't Verathon, right, that were impacted negatively throughout COVID. Those are now really rebounding very strongly, and that's just beginning as we're getting to sort of more normalized world in the medical world outside of the Verathon issue.
Allison Poliniak: Perfect. Thanks. I’ll pass it on.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.
Julian Mitchell: Just wanted to circle back firstly on the software businesses. Neil, you talked about, I think, there was obviously the cyclical aspect to an extent of the recurring revenue growth profile improving. Also sounds though like as if there's something more structural going on in driving that. So maybe help us understand what those aspects might be. I know your R&D to sales has gone up substantially in recent years. And also then within application. Just give us some update on Vertafore's performance relative to expectations on accretion and returns.
Neil Hunn: Okay. So let's take the software recurring question. Other than what I just mentioned about the shorter-term dynamics of mid singles going to high singles on the recurring revenue base, the structural element that's underpinning this is migration to the cloud. So you think we have -- our network businesses are almost all cloud as it speaks today delivered in that manner. The application businesses, you have Deltek, it's on its journey. You have Aderant, it's just starting its journey. You have PowerPlan, it's just starting its journey. At CBORD, it's just starting its journey. And we mentioned many times, it's our customers that are pacing this activity, not us. So this will take 5, 10 years to complete the migration, maybe longer. But as you do that, you're lifting customers that are paying you maintenance and getting them into the cloud are large installed base, and that's accretive, meaningfully accretive to the recurring revenue growth rate. Relative to Vertafore, I appreciate the question. Vertafore is just a rock-solid business. As we mentioned, when we bought it, it's 90-plus percent recurring in terms of its revenue stream. It's on track for -- against our models and our deal -- models and sort of our expectations. Q2 was a touch better than we thought. But all in all, I'll call it on track relative to financial performance. Specific to the company itself, Amy and her team, they've demonstrated a wonderful ability to land new large customers. I think we mentioned in Q4 of last year, maybe Q1, we've won the largest deal in the market since we've owned the company which is encouraging. The customer base really appreciates the steady hand of ownership of Roper as opposed to trading every 3 to 5 years of private equity. And so it's still early, but the early days are certainly positive.
Julian Mitchell: And then just my follow-up around Measurement & Analytical Solutions. It was touched on a little bit earlier, but the margin, obviously, you had sort of 300 bps of year-on-year pressure in Q2 on that margin line. Just wondered what's baked into the second half guidance on margins year-on-year in that segment. I think last second half, they were sort of 34.5% roughly. Just wondered where you think this second half shakes out in those margins relative to that.
Rob Crisci : Yes. So in our guide, we're assuming a little bit lower than that because you still had Verathon very, very strong in the third quarter and then fourth quarter was more normalized. So we have built in the guidance a little bit down from last year, but better than Q2 from a year-over-year fee standpoint.
Neil Hunn: Yes. It's principally Verathon we baked in a little supply chain pressure.
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen.
Joseph Giordano: So capping like a weird world here, I guess, we continue to be where markets are at high as rates keep pushing lower and everyone kind of scrambling to transact deals with really good balance sheets. So I'm just curious, when you talk about the funnel, have you seen kind of increased pressure in competition just because of the nature of where liquidity is and where rates are?
Neil Hunn: So we haven't -- while we've been in the market and talking with companies, we haven't been actively bidding on a large number of assets in this interim period as we've been deleveraging. So I can't speak with specificity to deals that we've done. But what I can speak to is what we're observing from other companies and other transactions that are happening. Here in the last quarter, certainly -- I won't time bound it. Since the beginning of the year, valuations for the assets that we looked at actually feel like they pulled back a touch. They've actually gotten a little bit better. Maybe moderate, maybe they're flat, maybe they're a little bit better, but they're certainly not increasing, which seems to be the case really since 2013 or '14. So that maybe that bodes well. But we'll be able to speak more to that as we get more into the market and start bidding on activity here late this year into next year.
Joseph Giordano: And then just a question on the New York project. This is kind of an initial foray into this type of work for big cities. Do you think that the amount of regulatory problems that this has had makes it less likely that other cities try to explore this? Or is the revenue potential for something like this outweigh that from the point of view of like the city leaders?
Neil Hunn: Well, first, I'd say I wouldn't characterize this as a regulatory problem. I would characterize it as a regulatory process that has slowed down the project. And so it's not as though people are saying, no, it's just a process that takes time. We all believe, by the way, the federal approval will occur. At the end of the day, it's an environmental approval, and this is about reducing cars and congestion and pollution in New York, right? So it is an environmental-friendly exercise. I think this is just the first in the United States. I think MTA in New York are sort of carving out what this looks like and sort of setting an expectation for the other cities in the U.S. that will eventually follow suit. So no, I don't think it will slow things now. If anything, it might speed it up because I know the road bumps are sort of well understood now.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.
Stephen Tusa: Just a question on Vertafore, the -- and the acquisition contributions at A&S. I think last quarter, it was like 39%. This quarter was 38%. Is there any like revenue volatility at all seasonally at Vertafore? I mean it's only like $10 million or something, but you also have EPSi in there, whatever the smaller one is. And any seasonality to those revenues at all?
Rob Crisci : Steve, there's a ton of seasonality. So Vertafore's Q1 is usually season of the best quarter. But you're right, it's just a few million dollars difference. And then the EPSi acquisition -- or integration with Strata is ongoing. So that's going very, very well. I think there are some customers that are choosing to go with Strata instead of EPSi, which is a wonderful thing as that thing is coming together. And so that, again, could give a couple of million dollars of revenue here and there that ends up in Strata versus EPSi. But overall, both of the deals are on track to our model, as Neil mentioned.
Stephen Tusa: Got it. And then just lastly, could you just remind us of anything seasonally on free cash flow? This year is kind of unusual, or maybe it's not, with the first quarter being strong and the second quarter kind of giving back a little bit sequentially. Anything in the second half moving mechanically that moves around seasonally? How do we think about kind of the sequential for free cash?
Rob Crisci : Sure. Yes. So as you know, the second quarter has 2 federal tax payments. So it's always our lowest conversion quarter. Now as we talked about, there is the benefit from the Vertafore tax attribute which we've -- which helped us in the second quarter against the payroll tax headwind which we talked about last quarter. So if you net those 2 together, probably a $40 million benefit for the second quarter. And then for the second half of the year though, those things really cancel each other out. So there's really no benefit from that for the second half of the year or any sort of a headwind. So as you move forward, Q3 and Q4 conversion should be pretty normal to what we normally see, which is 80% plus when you look at EBITDA to free cash flow.
Stephen Tusa: Okay. Got it. So like is there a number like so $1.9 billion for the year or something like that in cash?
Rob Crisci : Yes. I think 80% EBITDA to free cash flow conversion in the second half is kind of what we're expecting, and you can do the math.
Stephen Tusa: So that was a second half number. Okay. Got it. Awesome.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Blanton from Clear Harbor Asset Management.
Alexander Blanton: Nice quarter, it's great. Could you comment on CBORD, what it looks like for the fall with universities getting back into operation in a more normal way?
Neil Hunn: Yes. So I need to talk about CBORD. They had a great quarter. The bookings activity in the quarter was just fantastic. The vast majority of the bookings activity in the quarter was in higher education. So you see these universities really preparing to ramp up. It's a combination of integrated security platforms and the payments platform. And as you know, we have integration with the iPhone now for access to the campuses. And so they're certainly preparing, and it was just a great bookings quarter on that front for CBORD.
Operator: The next question comes from Rob Mason from Baird.
Robert Mason: Just back to the MTA project real quick. Could you just clarify how that will shake out -- how the revenue will shake out first half, second half? I think we were originally expecting about $100 million for the year. So now maybe that goes to $60 million, but just how that $60 million would break down first half, second half, if you could.
Neil Hunn: Happy to do it. Rob?
Rob Crisci : Yes. So we had about $35 million in the first half, and we're assuming about 25% in the second half and it's relatively split between Q3 and Q4. And the project continues, it's just sort of everything is slowing down. So we're continuing to work, and that's what -- if they can turn the switch tomorrow and that could speed up, but that's what we're assuming from a modeling standpoint.
Robert Mason: Okay. And then completion would be assumed -- of the installation would be assumed next year then?
Neil Hunn: That's the working assumption.
Robert Mason: Yes. Just a second question. Neil, you had spoken about the freight matching business, DAT, and that continues to be a very dynamic space. And you obviously have a very strong legacy position there. But I'm just curious if you could speak to how you're evolving the product given the way the market is evolving in that space and some of the things you've done or maybe what you're contemplating for future investments around that business.
Neil Hunn: Yes. I appreciate the question. You're right. It's a wonderful business and a wonderful space that enjoys a 3 to 4x relative market share advantage to our principal competitor. So we have tremendous scale advantage in this Freight Match spot market for freight in North America. It is a marketplace. It's a 2-sided network. It's paid by both the carriers and the brokers. There's value on both sides of the equation for sure. The big thing that's happening in the space is the brokers are becoming more tech-enabled, right? So how do you match and connect shipments with fewer and fewer calls and sort of complete automation straight through? A dynamic that's very similar to our business in the life insurance, very similar to Vertafore, conceptually. How do you tech-enable the agencies to do their job? And that's precisely the product road map that DAT is endeavoring, right? So you'll have the high end of folks that are going to do a lot of this on their own. And then you have the very long tail of thousands and thousands brokers that are going to run on our technology to do that. It's part of the reason why the strength is in the market today. It strengthened the business today. It's also what we believe will happen when you can organize the spot market in a more efficient way with less friction cost to match a load, then the spot market will compete very favorably against the contracted market, which is much larger. So we believe there'll be a permanent market share shift into the spot market which will further benefit our business, the brokers, et cetera. So it's -- we're very bullish on this for the long term.
Robert Mason: Is there the need to stretch back to the shipper, the origination side, for this business?
Neil Hunn: Well, we -- I mean, we did an acquisition last year that works with the shippers to understand volumes and rates and pricing. And we have an integrated offering now that shares sort of -- that provides pricing between the contracted market and the spot market. So we have an increasing relationship with the shippers. But the brokers provide a high and legitimate value in this value chain, right? So I think there will always be shipper -- principally shipper to broker to carrier relationship, it's just going to be a more automated and seamless relationship.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now turn the call back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-27 07:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies First Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President-Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the first quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you'll please turn to slide 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now, please turn to slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix to this presentation on our website. For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and our adjusted results consist of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenue and related commission expense; and lastly, a gain on sale related to a minority investment in Sedaru. And now if you'll please turn to slide 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. For this morning's call, I'll start with a brief summary of this quarter's results and activities. Rob will then highlight our P&L performance and balance sheet metrics. I'll then walk through our segment details, our increased outlook for the year and our concluding comments. As usual, we'll leave plenty of time to talk to your questions towards the end. Next slide, please. As we turn to page 5, we got off to a better start than we expected. Business execution was strong across the portfolio and was also broad based. We are encouraged by seeing nice improvements across the vast majority of our software and product-based end markets. In addition, we continue to see accelerating software recurring revenue growth, growing approximately 6% on an organic basis. Importantly, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions led by Vertafore continued to perform very well versus our expectations. When you put this altogether, we experienced double-digit growth across virtually all financial metrics: revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. The growth in cash flow performance in the quarter allowed to continue our rapid leveraging with about $500 million in debt paydown during the quarter. Based on this encouraging start, we're increasing our outlook and guidance for the full year. And with that let me turn it over to Rob to review the financial details. Rob? 
Rob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to page 6 and covering the Q1 financial highlights. Total revenue increased 13% to $1.53 billion which was an all-time record for any Roper quarter. Organic revenue for the enterprise declined 1% versus last year's plus 4% pre-pandemic comp. EBITDA grew 20% to $561 million. EBITDA margin increased 220 basis points to 36.7% on really great incrementals across the portfolio. Adjusted DEPS was $3.60 18% above prior year. Free cash flow was $543 million up 54%. We continue to benefit from our business transformation to a more software-weighted model where working capital boosts cash flow as our growth accelerates. Our results were enhanced a bit by approximately $40 million of accelerated payments that were the result of wins at our UK-based CliniSys laboratory software business. Aided by our outstanding cash flow performance, we reduced our debt by approximately $500 million in the quarter. More on that to follow. So in summary, a great start to 2021. Next slide. Turning to page 7, an update on our deleveraging. The charts on this page are a good preview for how we expect 2021 to look as we follow through on our commitment to reduce debt after our 2020 opportunistic capital deployment. As each quarter passes by we will benefit from meaningfully improved trailing EBITDA as the performance of last year's acquisitions rolls into Roper's financials. EBITDA is then further enhanced by our accelerating organic growth. Concurrently, our strong cash conversion allows us to apply our high levels of excess free cash flow toward consistent reduction of our debt. In the first quarter, we reduced our debt by approximately $500 million. Over the first three months of the year, our EBITDA growth, combined with debt reduction, enabled us to lower our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio from 4.7 to 4.2. We expect this downward trend in leverage ratios to continue moving forward. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to discuss our segment performance.
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Rob. As we turn to page 9, revenues in our application software segment were $578 million, up 2% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were an impressive 44.9% in the quarter. Across this segment, we saw organic, recurring revenue, which is about 75% of the revenue for this segment, increase approximately 6%. This recurring revenue strength is based on strong customer retention and continued migration to our SaaS delivery models. Of note, this quarter should be the last quarter of nonrecurring revenue declines, as we come across the COVID comp from last year. From a business unit perspective, Deltek continued its long string of great performance. As we expected, Deltek's recurring revenue grew nicely. Of particular importance, Deltek saw an increase to their perpetual revenue during the quarter, coming off a decently strong quarter a year ago. Also encouraging, was the nature of the bookings activity which was broad based across our architecture, engineering, creative and government contracting end markets. For reference, the professional services end markets tied to AEC and creative have been slow since the onset of COVID. Also CliniSys, our European lab software business, just crushed it during the quarter. As Rob mentioned, CliniSys had exceptionally strong cash flow, as they gained tremendous market share within the clinical lab consolidation occurring, within the United Kingdom. CliniSys has approximately 85% market share in the UK and is now recognized as one of four critical IT vendors for the entire National Health Service, just outstanding execution by the CliniSys team and congrats. We also saw thawing in the higher education markets that CBORD serves, certainly encouraging. Finally, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions continues to perform very well. Specific to Vertafore, we continue to be encouraged by their customers' comfort in having Roper as a long-term owner for the business. Also, Amy and her team have done a great job transitioning to Roper and our governance model. As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect high single-digit organic growth for this segment. This is based on the expectation for sustained levels of recurring revenue growth and the resumption of nonrecurring revenue growth. As it relates specifically to the second quarter, we expect our growth to be a touch below high single digits due to our global lab software group coming off, across a challenging comp from a year ago, as they are instrumental standing up COVID testing on a global basis, a solid and encouraging quarter for sure. And with that, let's turn to our next slide please. Turning to page 10. Revenue in our network segment were $440 million, flat versus last year and down 3% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 40.9% in the quarter. Our software businesses in the segment about 65% of the revenues were up 4% on an organic basis. This revenue was broad based among our software businesses and driven by organic recurring revenue growth of approximately 6%. Recurring revenue growth is underpinned by strong customer retention. Recurring revenues are also benefited by increasing network participation. At the business level, our Freight Match businesses both in the US and Canada continued to be solid growers for us. As a reminder, our Freight Match networks are critical and necessary elements to help organize and transact the trucking/shipping spot markets. Strength in our businesses has been on both sides of the network, brokers and carriers. We also continued to see nice organic gains at ConstructConnect, as their network enables commercial construction planning and bidding to occur in a more efficient and transparent manner. And lastly, as it relates to our network software businesses, we saw improved end market activity, especially in the middle market for Foundry, our media and entertainment compositing software business. Our non-software businesses in this segment were down 13% for the quarter, a touch better than we anticipated. TransCore's New York project work continues and is tracking well. TransCore's tag volumes declined versus a year ago based on lower traffic volumes across the US. Turning to the outlook for the balance of the year we expect to see high single-digit organic revenue growth for this segment with consistent high single-digit growth through the balance of the year for our network software businesses. As it relates specifically to the second quarter, we anticipate our segment organic growth to be a touch below HSD, given TransCore should be stronger in the second half versus next quarter based on timing of project execution and tag shipments. All in all a solid outlook for the balance of the year. Please turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 11 revenues in our MAS segment were $381 million up 2% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 34.8% in the quarter. As usual in this segment, we will profile the three macro parts medical products, Neptune and our industrial businesses. To start our medical product business has performed very well this quarter. Verathon continued its strength based on consistent factors: GlideScope unit placements and recurring consumables pull-through and continued momentum and share gains with our single-use bronchoscope product offering. What's also encouraging to see is the growth in their BladderScan product line. We believe this was based on a broader-based trend of hospitals resuming some normal level of clinical capital spending. We saw similar strength in our other medical product businesses as well. For instance Northern Digital had their best Q1's bookings quarter in history. This trend bodes well for the balance of the year. Neptune as expected declined in the quarter for the same reasons discussed in each of the last three quarters having limited access to indoor meters in the Northeast United States and Canada. However, we did see some easing of these restrictions in March and Neptune's customers are beginning to increase their maintenance schedules throughout Q2 and into the second half of the year. Finally our industrial businesses benefited from improvements in their end market conditions. For the balance of the year, we expect high single-digit growth for this segment. This is based on broadly improving conditions both in medical and industrial end markets and increases to access and indoor meter replacements at Neptune. This strength will be somewhat offset by the extraordinary prior year COVID demand at Verathon. We're encouraged by our expected high single-digit growth for the balance of the year. Now let's turn to our final segment Process Tech. As we turn to Page 12 revenues in our Process Technologies segment were $131 million down 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins hung in at 31% in the quarter. The short story here is, we're seeing improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment after nearly two years of declines. For instance, at CCC, we're seeing the resumption of previously deferred projects and demand for field services to come back online. Also Greenfield bidding activity is back in full swing especially on an international basis. Cornell, continues to perform well for us. This is particularly partially based on market conditions but also based on Cornell's product innovation as they're seeing very nice demand pickup for their IoT connected pumping solutions. As we look to the outlook for the balance of the year we see double-digit organic growth based on improving end market conditions and continued easing comps. Now please turn to Page 14 where I'll highlight our increased guidance for 2021. Based on strong Q1 performance and our increased confidence for the balance of the year we are raising our full year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $14.75 and $15 per share and organic growth to be in the 6% to 7% range. This 6% to 7% organic growth is against a 1% organic decline in 2020. This demonstrates that we have meaningfully improved on an organic basis since 2019. The compounding continues.  Our tax rate should continue to be in the 21% to 22% range. For the second quarter we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $3.61 and $3.65 and expect second quarter organic revenue growth to be in line with the full year organic growth rate. Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. Turning to Page 15 and our closing summary this was an encouraging start and we're raising our outlook for the year. We performed well across virtually every financial metric with double-digit increases in revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. EBITDA margins expanded nicely and free cash flow grew 54% to $543 million, which enabled us to continue our rapid deleveraging in the quarter. Importantly, we are well positioned for continued double-digit compounding. We're seeing improving conditions across virtually all of our end markets. When combined with our leading market positions, we expect high-single-digit organic growth for the remainder of the year. As owners or prospective owners of Roper Tech, you should be encouraged by our increasing levels of recurring revenue and the stability of our recurring revenue growth. Also, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions are performing very well and Vertafore has proven to be an excellent addition to our growing portfolio of software businesses. We continue to focus on deleveraging our balance sheet and remain committed and focused on our long-term capital deployment strategy. To this end, our pipeline of M&A candidates is active, robust and has many high-quality opportunities. As our balance sheet becomes more offensive towards the end of this year, our active pipeline of M&A targets will enable us to resume capital deployment in our usual process-oriented and disciplined manner. In closing and as we turn to your questions, we recently announced that Amy Woods Brinkley will become our new Board Chair effective June 1. Amy has been a tremendous Board member since 2015 and will be a fantastic Board Chair. I certainly look forward to working with Amy and the full Board for many years to come. But, as we turn to your questions, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge and thank our outgoing Board Chair, Bill Prezzano. Bill has been a Roper Director since 1997 and has reached our mandatory Board retirement age. He served as our Lead Independent Chair, Director and became Board Chair during the CEO transition from Brian Jellison to myself. Bill has been a wonderful Board Chair, enabling a smooth CEO transition and the continued evolution of our strategy and business model. On a personal note, Bill has been a tremendous mentor to me, which I hope will continue on an informal basis for years to come. Bill, thank you for your years of service to Roper shareholders, I think the share price is around $16 when you started. And thank you for helping me become a better leader and Chief Executive Officer. With that, we'd like to open it up to your questions.
Operator: We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Christopher Glynn: Hey, thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Christopher Glynn: So, strong margins across the board, I was curious. In particular, Application Software was particularly better than expected. I don't know, if Vertafore had some incremental revenue versus what you expected, but what kind of drove up the App Soft margins in the quarter?
Rob Crisci: Hey, Chris. Good morning. Yes, there's strength across those businesses. I think Neil mentioned CliniSys was strong, Sunquest had a nice quarter. Deltek, sort of perpetual license wins there. All that stuff comes in at really high incrementals, and that drove most of the margin performance.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And then, a question on acquisition philosophy. You've kind of highlighted financial profile and returns and characteristics over strategic end markets. But, it strikes that Vertafore and iPipeline two out of your three biggest deals ever, both kind of serve in the insurance marketplaces. I'm wondering if there's any emerging prioritization in types of end markets.
Neil Hunn: Hey, Christopher, I appreciate the question, and the opportunity to talk about that. The short answer is no. I mean our M&A strategy, for 20 years, is centered on picking the best businesses and business models that we can identify from the range of opportunities in the marketplace. If you go back to really starting in 2011, you might have thought from 2011 to 2013, we're all about health care IT; and then maybe from 2014 to 2017 about professional services ERP; and then the last couple of years about insurance tech. But all of those steps are completely coincidental. We really just evaluate the range of opportunities and pick the very best business that we can find. 
Operator: The next question is from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Deane.
Rob Crisci: Good morning.
Deane Dray: First question is, how would you characterize the software demand this quarter? It might be hard to parse this out, but how much might have been pent-up from the COVID shutdown kind of a catch-up versus a true recovery and resumption of growth? I'm not sure you can characterize it broadly, but maybe some individual examples within the businesses. Thanks.
Neil Hunn: Yes. I’m -- I don't think there's much pent-up here from our call-downs to our businesses this year. So this quarter it's more of a -- more recovery story. For instance, we talked about in the prepared remarks about the professional services end markets that Deltek serves. Architecture engineering, creative agencies started to come back in the quarter which is great to see.  Vertafore was steady as she goes. They were not particularly impacted by the pandemic. Aderant law firms continued to proceed with their transition. We did see some recovery start in the education and health care markets at CBORD. The middle market at Foundry which is great to see as production -- live production begins and comes out of production into post production. It was really just a nice increasing sort of start to recovery.  And then anytime anybody asked a question about software, we got to talk about the recurring revenue stream. It was around 6% growth organically across the two segments and in total, which bodes well for the future. 
Deane Dray: That's great to hear. And then just a second question. Since it is such a high-profile project any updates on the New York City congestion tolling? I saw in the slide it says that work has continued, but any update there would be helpful? Thanks. 
Neil Hunn: Yes. Just the project continues. The customer continues to want us to get the project done so they can commence the discussions on how they're going to do the tolling and begin to start the tolling. Certainly, the most macro backdrop is more favorable now with the administration in the White House and Secretary Pete and all the -- that is all in a much more favorable position than it was just a quarter or two ago. So the project continues. 
Operator: The next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Julian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. Maybe my first question just to try and circle back on to the margin aspect. So in Application Software, you did have a very substantial margin increase year-on-year in the first quarter. You've laid out some of the reasons why.  But maybe just help us understand sort of as we think about the balance of the year for that business and maybe for Roper firm-wide, what type of incremental margins or margin trajectory we should expect. Because it looks as if the sort of drop-through margin is maybe around 20% in the guide for the balance of the year. I just wanted to sort of check how you are thinking about that? 
Rob Crisci: Yes. So I'll give a crack at that. On an EBITDA margin basis, right, I mean Vertafore is a higher-EBITDA-margin business. So that -- you're seeing that and we talked about when we bought the business, it's around a 50% or so a little below that EBITDA margin business. So that helps. I think on a core basis, it's going to be relatively consistent year-over-year for the rest of the businesses on an EBITDA margin basis. And that's conversion at 40% to 50%. And that's just consistent with what we see in these businesses as they grow. And as you know, they have great cash characteristics, very negative working capital. So the cash flow growth can often be even faster than the EBITDA growth. And so it's a great story there and I think we'll continue to see margins high into that segment. 
Neil Hunn: And Julian, this is Neil. Just to underscore one thing Rob said, I mean the incremental EBITDA margins for the year are 40% as he said. I just want to underscore again. 
Rob Crisci: Yes. That's right. 
Julian Mitchell: Perfect. Thanks very much. And then second question, would really be around the -- in network software. How are you thinking about the -- leaving aside TransCore the sort of core piece of it you did have some big impacts there in network software last year from COVID in sort of health care food and media I think you had called out before. Maybe just clarify what pace of sort of top line acceleration you're seeing in some of those COVID-impacted areas and what kind of cyclical recovery if you like in network software you're experiencing. 
Rob Crisci: Yes. So, the network software businesses are strong high single-digit organic for the rest of the year. That's the consistency in the recurring which we talked about has been growing all along. But then you do get a little bit of a bounce back in some of the markets. You mentioned Foundry and others. So, I think you're on the right track there. Neil do you want to add anything to that?
Neil Hunn: Yes. Just to color on the three the health care entertainment and food. So, MHA is the health care business that was tied and indexed to patient and volumes going through long-term care, skilled nursing assisted living facilities, that's normalized. That business also has added products to its contract portfolio. So, that business is on its way to recovery as we speak. We talked about Foundry in the prepared remarks which is there's just tremendous content budget not surprising in the marketplace and all that content requires postproduction and we're a critical element in that post. And then finally iTrade, iTrade is going to be one of the longer recovery cycles for us. It'll be a second half this year and the next year as they're indexed partially to retail/food, but also partially to what I'll call institutional food which is think about that as restaurants, schools, universities, a little bit of stadiums. And that's going to come back on a longer recovery curve. 
Operator: The next question is from Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Allison Poliniak: Hi guys. Good morning. Just want to circle back on to Deane's question around -- I know he mentioned around the reopening kind of theme in Q2 and it sounds like you are seeing some green shoots. Just trying to reconcile for the balance of the year. It sounds like you guys are expecting a more, I would say, gradual recovery in some of those businesses. Any color from your customers in terms of are they still a little concerned about the COVID impact? Are they thinking maybe there could be some pent-up demand as we sort of exit this year? Any thoughts there?
Neil Hunn: Well, we got to sort of run through the portfolio Allison in that regard. I think it'll be -- or I think our comments here will be around the product businesses as opposed to the software ones. First is the tag volumes at TransCore. I mean that's going to be a probably a second half of this year recovery cycle just based on when the tags were bought last year into this year and having the customers burn through existing inventory as traffic patterns come back on. We talked about medical products. We got the COVID headwind for a quarter or two at Verathon, but the other businesses definitely saw a palpable improvement in the capital purchases of their medical equipment in the quarter. And we got no sense if that was pent-up or onetime. We'll find out in the next quarter or two, but that was not the read-through from the conversations we had with our customers. In fact, NDI had record bookings in the quarter. As we go through the industrial businesses, Struers, we definitely saw an improvement across the portfolio of industrial businesses through the quarter with Struers having record March bookings which shows that there's some sort of gradual improvement there to continue. And then on the Process Technologies businesses there was just nice -- I would call that very similar to what we saw at Struers and industrial. March got better than February and February was better than January.
Allison Poliniak: Great, that's helpful. And then a strong deleveraging in the quarter. You talked about an active pipeline maybe more comfort towards the end of the year. Any change to thinking just given the strong performance so far? Obviously, strong cash flow characteristics that you would have some comfort level of staying slightly above your comfort range at this point. Or are you still focused on getting that down in terms of the net debt leverage?
Rob Crisci: Yes, Allison, it was a great start to deleveraging for Q1. So, that certainly helped boost our ability to pay down the debt faster and we'll continue to do that throughout the year. And as Neil mentioned, we're making sure the pipeline is active and there are some exciting things that we're looking at in the early stages and we'll be ready to deploy capital at some point. But for right now, we're really focused on the deleveraging. 
Operator: The next question is from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Hey, good morning guys.
Neil Hunn: Good morning Joe.
Joe Giordano: Hey Rob, just -- I'm going to pick on the guide a little bit. So, revenue for the year you're expecting 6% to 7%. It was kind of mid-single-digit-plus before -- came in pretty good into 1Q. Good margins. And we're kind of just passing through the 1Q beat essentially maybe a tad higher than that for the full year. So, like how would you kind of argue that? Are you seeing anything incrementally challenging? It sounds like you're -- everything seems to be at least on plan if not a bit above. So, just we want to think through the framework there?
Rob Crisci: Yeah, I think that's right. I think it was one quarter, right? We had a really nice first quarter. And we felt it prudent to raise the guide, because it certainly gives us more confidence for the rest of the year. But it was one quarter and this is an unusual environment where we're coming off of a sort of hopefully once-a-lifetime pandemic. And so we're trying to be balanced in the outlook and sort of what we do with the businesses.
Joe Giordano: Yeah. That's fair. And maybe can you talk us through just like the structural differences between the lab software businesses in the US and in Europe, and how businesses in each region are like differently positioned and why CliniSys is able to do so well here?
Neil Hunn: Yeah. I mean, the -- in the US, the -- as we've talked about quite a bit, the lab was the first part of the hospital to become automated. And then 20 years later due to -- with the government stimulus there was the -- hospitals deployed electronic medical records. And then those EMRs -- the hospitals as a general matter appreciated and wanted the connectivity of the lab software to the EMR and that's how we had had sort of the competitive headwinds for four or five years at Sunquest. When you look at Europe, that dynamic does not exist. The health systems are different first of all. They're country driven. The -- there is not the concept of an EMR landscape on a country-by-country basis. It's very, very different. It's characterized by local providers, characterized by country-specific providers.  nd as a result CliniSys' lab software is not just -- we highlighted the UK wins and strengths in this quarter, but they've just been doing a great job pan-European in France in Benelux emerging presence in Germany, bought a small business last year in Spain to be able to consolidate the laboratory infrastructure across Europe. Each of the countries in their own way are going through a laboratory consolidation in a way to save money for the health system itself and we being the -- basically the only scaled provider that with the demonstrable success at scale and being able to win market share at a meaningful clip there.
Joe Giordano: And just so I understand, what gives you confidence that sort of like integration of labs with the broader hospital systems is not something that's a near-term threat to the business?
Neil Hunn: Yeah. I think it's essentially you need -- the way that for instance the primary competitor in the US that we -- is Epic. Epic for instance is -- basically doesn't have a presence in Europe. And when they do, it's a country-specific presence. They might be in a very small country or small region of a country and it's sort of isolated there given that it's a country-specific decision process. And also there just isn't -- that competitive activity just isn't there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Blake Gendron from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Blake Gendron: Thanks, good morning. First question on free cash flow. The conversion from EBITDA has been extremely -- exceedingly strong over the last several quarters on top of already strong margins. How should we think about conversion going forward through the year, relative to what you accomplished in 4Q and 1Q? I'd imagine the recovery in nonrecurring software is helping the working capital profile. So really just wondering how sustainable that trend is as the recovery kind of moderates through the year?
Rob Crisci: Sure. So I think -- so in the first quarter right there's no federal tax payments. So that's always a high cash conversion quarter. So that normalizes more when we make the -- start making federal payments in Q2. But really as I mentioned a little bit earlier, I mean, it's great growth from the software businesses. They have negative working capital. Therefore, the cash performance is very strong. The more software growth you have, you drive working capital further negative. It's very structural part of the model. High conversion is embedded in everything that we do. So we expect that free cash flow conversion to continue to get better over time as we've improved the quality of our portfolio. So we feel good about the rest of the year and continue to have high cash conversion and continue that double-digit cash flow compounding that we all expect to achieve.
Blake Gendron: Excellent. Just wanted to circle back on M&A. So plenty of puts and takes with potential US tax increases and yields moving higher. I'm wondering if you could help us think about these inputs in the context of historical private software pricing in the pipeline. Some of these changes come through taxes rise, yields rise. How would you expect asset pricing to evolve, or how has it evolved in the past? I think we've discussed this before about it being a net positive for Roper.
Neil Hunn: Yes. We certainly believe balance that's the case. So, well obviously, when taxes went down rates are – sort of private prices went up a touch. I think the - it was 14 times, 15 times for Deltek and 16 times for PowerPlan and really the only difference in the market there was the tax change. So that gives you a sense of the order of magnitude. Maybe a couple of turns but it depends on what the magnitude of the tax change is. Relative to interest rates going up we think that does greatly benefit us in the compounding model. If you think as interest rates go up we're competing against private equity firms, who have a levered acquisition model. So as interest rates go up the amount of leverage they can put on a transaction goes down. And subsequently, the total equity that they put into a deal goes down and multiples compress more so with interest rates going up I think than what you see conversely with taxes. And then in our case, the majority of our acquisition proceeds come from our cash that we generate. And so we're relatively insensitive to interest rate where our competitors for acquisitions are. So in the long arc of time that's a good thing for us.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Steve Tusa: Hi, guys. Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Steve. Thanks for joining in.
Steve Tusa: Thanks for having me. Just to clarify on the answer before on kind of the degree of leverage you're comfortable with before doing a new deal is kind of three times, a bit of a line in the sand there, where you would get back down to below that before doing another deal, or maybe just talk about kind of that three times level and how that kind of plays into your thoughts?
Rob Crisci: Yes, sure. I wouldn't say a line in the sand. I think once you get into the low threes that –certainly it's more reasonable. I think the – we spent a lot of time with the rating agencies, when we did our last couple of acquisitions. I think they understand the high quality of the cash flow that we have and our incredibly high cash conversion. And so it's really about how good our business model is, how fast we can pay down any leverage that we put on the business. I think we've demonstrated that time and time again and we can do it pretty quickly. So once we get into the low threes then I think we have the ability to deploy capital.
Steve Tusa: Okay. Great. And then just lastly when you kind of look out to next year are there any – you're obviously not going to have any deals here at least in the near term. But are there any moving parts and items from a headwinds perspective whether it's the Vertafore tax benefit or some of these Sunquest deals around COVID? How do those play out for next year? Do they generally offset – are they offset by growth in some of the other businesses? Maybe if there's anything mechanical that kind of happens next year that you want to call out?
Rob Crisci: So I'll – let me just hit a couple of things and then I think Neil wants to add on. But yes, you're right, there's this $100 million-plus tax benefit around Vertafore that we talked about that will hit throughout Q2 through Q4. We did not benefit from that in the first quarter. And then there's about $60 million or so of this payroll tax deferral which is a bad guy this year for the rest of the year, given that was part of the COVID rules that you can defer some of those payments. And there's always going to be pluses and minuses in sort of that part of the world, but I'll let Neil talk about some of the growth.
Neil Hunn: Well, I think it's always appreciated in a quarter that we have here you highlight the headwinds going into next year Steve, so we appreciate that. But as a general matter year two, out of a pandemic should be pretty good.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Blanton from Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please go ahead.
Alex Blanton: Hi. Hi, good morning. Congratulations. That's a great quarter and it looks like you're going to have a very good year. I just wanted to comment that so far there've been seven analysts and every one of them has been cut off before they finished with their second question. None of them said, thank you, and I'd like to ask the moderator to please stop doing that because that is really not a very good way to conduct a call. You need to allow dialogue with the management on the second question. Don't cut people off before they say thank you. Let them finish, please. I wanted to ask about the backlog of opportunities that you mentioned that you might get back to accessing it at the end of the year, as you start to deploy capital. Could you just say, a little more on the nature of that pipeline the size of the companies in there? Because as you get bigger, it's obviously important to find bigger and bigger companies in order to keep the growth rate constant. So could you just give us a little bit on that? And perhaps, characterize the kinds of markets those companies are in that you're looking at in the pipeline?
Neil Hunn: Alex, it's Neil here. Appreciate the question and appreciate your opening comments. The – let me give you a broader view to the – to your question. First, why we're active now with our M&A pipeline is that, we – and we're meeting with companies is that every company of size that we bought from 2016 forward we met with roughly 9 months to 12 months at the earliest – at a minimum before buying the company. So we're establishing a relationship getting to know the management team, getting to know the business, and then sort of if you will have a running start when the business actually comes for sale. So we're active. And the work we're doing now is going to pay dividends 9, 12, 18 months from now in terms of deploying capital, and our ability to do that in companies that we have a high level of conviction in. To your question about doing bigger and bigger deals, I would beg to differ with that a little bit. When you look at our model over the next seven years, we have to deploy somewhere on a run rate basis $2 billion to $2.5 billion a year based on our cash flow and the leverage profile that we just talked about. And in doing so, when you're looking at the types of businesses that we look to buy, small market vertically focused, leading software-type or software-type business models, I think the sweet spot in that is going to be somewhere in the $750 million to $1.5 billion range. So we're talking about doing a couple-ish deals a year and then we'll always do a small number of tuck-ins or bolt-ons to the existing portfolio. So I think we can – at least for the next seven years on a per-year basis we don't have to do bigger and bigger deals to keep the growth rate at the sustained double-digit rate.
Alex Blanton: But would you say that, these companies the margins and the cash flow and the EBITDA and so on are such that you can keep increasing those metrics like EBITDA margin and the operating margin and the gross margin, the way you've done for many, many years by buying companies that have margins that are above the corporate average? Can you keep doing that?
Rob Crisci: I think so. The answer to that is yes, Alex. So it's really about the target the businesses that we target right? Businesses that have higher organic growth than Roper has historically businesses that have very good margins often better than Roper at least at the same level now that we've improved ours over many, many years. And then we buy those businesses. They grow. We hope – we believe we can make them better. They accelerate growth. They generate more cash and you get this compounding effect. And so it's really the same strategy that – I appreciate you've followed us for a long time – we've had for – for over a decade now. And it's – the good news is as you get more and more into software and these types of opportunities we find more and more companies that fit that model that will allow us to continue to improve all those metrics for many, many more years to come. 
Alex Blanton: Right. Well, this has been the company's strategy since I started following it in 1992, when you went public. It's been a great ride. Thank you very much.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Rob Crisci: Thank you, Alex.
Operator: Next question comes from Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Richard Eastman: Yes. Yes. Good morning and thank you.
Rob Crisci: Hi, Richard.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Richard.
Richard Eastman: Yes, Good morning. Just a question or two around the Application Software business. And when we look at the lab software business as part of that in aggregate around CliniSys and Sunquest, you've spoken nicely about CliniSys's share gains in Europe and the rationale for that. Could you just talk a little bit and maybe characterize the US business around Sunquest? Has Sunquest's share stabilized? And maybe post COVID what does the recovery environment look like for Sunquest domestically?
Neil Hunn: Yes. So Sunquest did -- I mean, they were benefited -- let's also -- let me back up. Let's not -- so you mentioned two companies CliniSys and Sunquest. We ought to include a third which is Data Innovations, which is a middleware business. They've -- they're very global business, but they're domiciled in the US. But specific to your question about Sunquest, the US laboratory business, they were benefited last year and in this quarter with the COVID tailwinds standing up COVID testing. They continued to invest in their public health offering and their molecular offering. The leadership team has done a nice job in that. So that's good news. The unfortunate part of that news is it just delayed the bottoming of this business, which we thought was going to be this year-ish if it weren't for COVID. Now it's going to be pushed out a year or two before that business sort of gets through all the known attrition and then is baselined from, which it can grow from.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And how much of that lab software business now is domestic? When you put those three businesses together CliniSys, Sunquest and Data Innovation, how much is domestic versus international? Is it a 50-50…
Neil Hunn: I'm going to let Rob take a look at this. We might have to get back to you.
Rob Crisci : Yes. I might have to circle back. I mean, it's approaching probably 50-50 given the growth in the CliniSys business the fact the DI business is very global and the Sunquest business is mostly US. So as a group it's probably about half.
Richard Eastman: I understand. And then just a follow-up question around measurement analytical and the process businesses. Could you just talk about pricing there? I know you usually allow your GMs to price according to margin targets and things. But can you talk about price and how proactive you've been able to be on the M&A business as well -- M&A as in Measurement & Analytical and the process side?
Neil Hunn: Yes. I think the characteristics of these businesses is they -- all Roper businesses is they price based on the values created. A great example, there is in our Hansen business where they've had a couple of innovations in their refrigeration valve business product line with coatings and some sensors to allow to identify clearly when it's been triggered, very low-cost increase to bill of materials, but massive increase to value. So we've seen very nice price increases on situations like that. On a like-for-like basis it's -- the businesses are agile. They've been very good at being able to push through any increase to the bill of materials kind of the supply chain and otherwise taking normal price. 
Richard Eastman: Okay. All right. Well, thank you.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Rob Crisci: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now turn -- return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-01-29 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today’s call is being recorded. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would like now to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning. Thank you all for joining us as we discuss the Fourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Results for Roper Technologies. We hope everyone is doing well. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O’Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today’s call. We have prepared slides to accompany today’s call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you please turn to slide two. We begin with our safe-harbor statement. During the course of today’s call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today’s call in the context of that information. And now, please turn to slide three. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter and year, primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consist of the following items, amortization of acquisition related intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments to acquire deferred revenue and related commission expense, and lastly transaction related expenses for completed acquisitions. And now, if you please turn to slide four, I’ll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Zack. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and we hope everyone is doing well. For today's agenda, we'll walk through our 2020 financials and operational highlights, then we'll turn to our 2020 segment detailed results and discuss our 2021 segment-by-segment outlook and end with our 2021 enterprise guidance prior to discussing your questions. Next slide, please. As we look back on 2020, it was quite a year. Our businesses performed at a very high level during this period. Revenues grew 3% with organic revenue declining a single percent. EBITDA also grew 3%, and free cash flow grew 16%. This cash flow performance, $1.7 billion is just astounding. This is a testament to many things, notably our asset light business model, the intimacy we have with our customers and the high level of skill and execution of our field teams. This cash flow is just simply a great result. Perhaps more important, 2020 was a year of forward progress for our company. We exit 2020 as a better company, a company with higher quality revenue streams, a company with improved future innovation prospects and a company with whose portfolio was enhanced with $6 billion of capital deployment. To this end, we saw our software recurring revenues increase mid single digits in 2020 and were benefited by high levels of retention and acceleration to the cloud. We continue to be benefited by having close intimate relationships with our customers. Most often, our software is mission-critical to our customer’s operations. In addition, we continue to strategically invest throughout our portfolio during the year. Based on our historical experience, we find times of market disruption the best time to double down on innovation and market investments, which in turn will drive market share gains in the years to come.  Finally, we were able to deploy $6 billion to further enhance Roper's Group of companies' headlines by our Vertafore acquisition. So when we look back on 2020, we highlight two key themes. First, we grew. Cash flow increased 16% in the middle of a pandemic, and second, the quality of our enterprise continued to improve during the year. Net-net, we got bigger and better during 2020. Let's turn to the next slide. Over the past 5 years, we highlight that our revenue grew at a 9% compounded rate, EBITDA at 10% and cash flow at 13%. We continue to grow and compound through macroeconomic cycles. Also, during the time period, the quality of our enterprise meaningfully improved. We are more software-focused with nearly two thirds of our EBITDA coming from software with higher levels of recurring revenue. Conversely, we are much less tied to cyclical end markets today, a little over 15% of our portfolio. Given our long-term strategy and these factors, we are a low-risk enterprise. We compound cash flow through cycle and do so with multiple growth drivers across both organic and inorganic fronts. As we look to '21, we will continue our long-term string of revenue and EBITDA and cash flow compounding. So with that, let's turn to the next page and discuss the macro backdrop for '21. As we look to 2021, we are set up for a strong year. We expect revenue and EBITDA will grow well into the double-digits, likely in the mid-teens range with organic revenue growth in the mid single digit plus range. This is on top of growth in 2020, the compounding continues. Breaking it down, our software businesses both in our application software and network segments are well-positioned heading into '21. These businesses enter the year with momentum from strong retention and recurring revenue gains. They will be further aided by growth in perpetual license, as pipeline and customer activity are anticipated to recover to some extent. Our non-Verathon medical product businesses are expected to return to a more normalized pattern of customer activity, as health care facilities loosen restrictions. But since 2020 was while below trend, we expect above trend growth here. Of note, Verathon has a challenging comp. However, the reoccurring revenue base will remain strong given the large volume of capital placements in 2020 and continued growth of their new single-use Bronchoscope business. We expect Neptune to recover and grow nicely as our customers, especially in the Northeast, US and Canada, gain access to residential locations. We expect our Industrial and Process Tech businesses to continue their quarterly improvements and return to growth after 2 years of macro headwinds. Finally, 2021 will be meaningfully aided by the contribution from our 2020 cohort of acquisitions. To this end, we continue to work with a very full and high-quality M&A pipeline. We are committed to deleveraging, but we also remain active in building and maturing our pipe. So as I think back over the nearly 10 years I've been with Roper, I cannot think of a better set of tailwinds heading into a year. Clearly, lot to do and lots of execution in front of us, but we have a strong momentum heading into 2021. So now let me turn the call over to Rob. Rob?
Rob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to page eight, while looking at our Q4 income statement performance. Total revenue increased 8%, as we eclipsed $1.5 billion of quarterly revenue for the first time. Organic revenue for the enterprise declined 2% versus prior year. EBITDA grew 7% in the quarter to a record $552 million. EBITDA margin was down 40 basis points versus prior year at 36.6%. Tax rate came in at 19.9%, a little lower than last year's 21.6%. So all-in, this resulted in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.56 which is above our guidance range. Next slide. Turning to page nine, reviewing the Q4 results by segment. Neil will discuss the full year 2020 segment performance in more detail later, so just touching on some of the Q4 highlights here by segment. Application Software grew 35% with the addition of Vertafore. Organic for the segment was minus 2% with mid single digit recurring revenue growth continuing. Sharp declines in our CBORD & Horizon businesses, serving K-12 and higher education impacted the segment, as many schools unfortunately remain closed. For network software systems, plus 2% organic growth with our Software businesses, putting up a very solid plus 4% organic. The TransCore was flat versus prior year. For Measurement & Analytical Solutions, plus 1% organic growth, as we start to see some sequential recovery at Neptune in our Industrial businesses. Segment margins were impacted a bit by the acceleration of some product and channel investments at Verathon as we discussed coming into the quarter, and it's really been a conceptual [ph] year for Verathon overall. Lastly, for Process Technologies, a 21% organic decline, with margins holding up well at 31.3%. And once again here, we started to see some early signs of improvement after a couple of years of declines. Next slide. So turning to page 10, looking at net working capital. Honestly, the slide mostly speaks for itself, ending the quarter with negative 8% net working capital as a percentage of Q4 annualized revenue. While there are certainly some seasonal trends, primarily around timing of software renewals, they do typically benefit our Q4 performance. You can see here a meaningful improvement versus 2018, improving from negative 3.4% to negative 8% in 2020. Our asset-light negative net working capital model drives our sustainable, high cash conversion and fuels our cash flow compounding. Our people focus on what we all believe matters and our culture is built around growing the right way. Topline growth converts to cash flow, and we are always mindful of impacts to our balance sheet. Next slide. So turning to cash flow, cash flow performance, as Neil mentioned was really pretty spectacular, no matter how you look at it. Q4 free cash flow of $558 million was 23% higher than last year and represented 37% of revenue. This excellent result was driven by the great working capital performance I just discussed, which is really across the enterprise, along with meaningful cash contributions from Vertafore and the other recent acquisitions. So for the full year of 2020, we generated $1.72 billion of operating cash flow and $1.67 billion of free cash flow. So to repeat, that's $1.7 billion of free cash flow in 2020, truly a great year. Full year free cash flow growth was 16%, and our free cash flow conversion from EBITDA was a robust 84%. So really tremendous cash flow performance, and it was broad-based and very durable. Next slide. So turning to page 12, updating on our balance sheet. As Neil mentioned earlier, we ended the year with total capital deployment of approximately $6 billion, which included the EPSi acquisition that closed during the fourth quarter on October 15. We were able to take advantage of attractive market conditions to complete and opportunistically fund these acquisitions with a combination of internally generated cash flow, proceeds from our 2019 Gatan divestiture and investment-grade leverage. Overall cost of financing was approximately 1%. Thanks to our excellent Q4 cash performance, we're off to a great start on our plan to quickly reduce leverage, paying down around $500 million since we closed the EPSi deal. Looking ahead, we plan to rapidly reduce leverage throughout 2021, taking advantage of our prepayable revolver, which has a current balance of approximately $1.6 billion. Our solid investment-grade balance sheet supports long-term cash flow compounding, which we are well-positioned to continue. So with that, I'll pass it back over to Neil for the remainder of our prepared remarks.
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Rob. Let's turn to our recap for 2020. To help orient you to this page, we're comparing a full year outlook from last April to that of what actually happened. It's worth reminding everyone that we felt our businesses and our business model had the level of recurring revenue, customer intimacy and the business leadership required to guide in the face of the COVID uncertainty, both in terms of supply and demand. In aggregate, we thought our full year organic revenues to be plus or minus flat, and we came in at down minus 1%. The TransCore New York project is the primary reconciling item between being down a touch and being flat or slightly up, and more on this in a minute. We guided DEPS to be between $11.60 and $12.60 and came in at $12.74. Looking back on this, we are very proud of our team's ability to look forward and operate through the uncertainty of last year. Also, there is no better example of the durability of our model than this past year. With that, let's walk through the macro drivers across each of our four segments. Relative to Application Software, this segment played out as anticipated and was up 1% on an organic basis for the year. Specifically, we saw recurring revenue up mid single digits, aided by very strong retention rates, as well as an acceleration to the cloud. As a reminder, recurring revenue in this segment is about 70% of our revenue stream. Perpetual revenues, about 10% of this segment's revenue were under pressure as expected. We saw this revenue stream down mid teens as new logo opportunities and wins were pushed and delayed. That said, cross-selling activity remained active for much of 2020. Relative to services revenue, we anticipated some pressure tied to shifting to remote installs and having fewer new implementations, which are tied to new perpetual transactions. For 2020, we saw mid single digit declines here, principally tied to fewer new deals. Our teams did a wonderful job shifting to remote installs, a trend we anticipate will continue in large part on the backside of the pandemic. As it relates to our Network segment, we expect the organic revenue for the year to be up mid singles to double-digits when, in fact, we grew 3% for the full year. Our Network Software businesses performed as anticipated with recurring revenues growing low single digits, again, benefited by high retention rates and high levels of recurring revenue. This segment underperformed our expectations, primarily due to TransCore's New York congestion infrastructure project timing. In April, we expected approximately $75 million more in revenue from this project than actually occurred in 2020. More on this when we turn to the segment overview, but we expect this $75 million of pushed revenue to be recognized in 2021. It's also worth noting that the number of Toll Tags Shipped last year were at historic lows given the lower traffic volumes, but this was anticipated. For our MAS segment, we've talked all year about this being the tale of four situations, Verathon, Other Medical Products, Neptune and Industrial. For the year, again, back in April, we felt this group would be flat to up mid single digits on an organic basis. We posted 1% growth. We feel very good about the execution across this group of companies. The primary reconciliation factor is a slower recovery ramp tied to our non-Verathon Medical product businesses and Neptune. Specifically, we anticipated unprecedented demand for Verathon's innovation product family. For the year, Verathon grew substantially, as COVID accelerated the further adoption of video intubation as the preferred technology. Our other medical product businesses, which grow mid-single digits like clockwork, were down mid single digits for the year, tied directly to lower elective procedure volumes and limited hospital capital spending. Interestingly for Neptune, we highlighted municipal budget uncertainty in April. This proved generally to be a non-factor, as municipalities budgets were approved and available. However, the impact of the lockdowns, especially in the Northeast, US and Canada, had a prolonged impact on our customer’s ability to do routine meter replacements. As a result, Neptune was down low double-digits for the year, slightly worse than our initial expectations. Finally, for this segment, we expected sharp industrial declines, and that is what happens, with these businesses being down low double-digits for the year. That said, we are seeing sequential quarterly improvements across both Neptune and our Industrial businesses. Finally, and as it relates to our Process Tech Segment, we expect it to be down 20% to 25%, and we were logging in at down 21%. This played out as we anticipated with much lower energy-related spending, project timing pushes and the inability to get field service resources into customer locations. So this is the play-by-play rewind for 2020. Now let's turn to the segment pages for a bit more detail. Next slide, please. For Application Software, where revenues here were $1.81 billion, up 1% organically with EBITDA of $772 million. The broad macro activity for this segment has remained quite consistent for much of 2020. Specifically, we continue to see accelerating demand for our cloud solutions. This bodes well for our long-term recurring revenue growth and customer intimacy. At a business unit level, Deltek's GovCon business continues to be super solid and grow very nicely. But we did see some headwinds relative to their offerings that target the consulting, marketing services and AEC space. That said, recent customer activity and top-of-funnel activity suggest some market falling is occurring. Aderant and PowerPlan delivered flat EBITDA in the year with nice recurring revenue gains. We experienced very nice growth across our Lab Software group, again doing our part to help fight the COVID war. Strata delivered double-digit organic growth and completed a strategic acquisition in EPSi. Notably, the combined business will analyze roughly half of the US hospital spend. Finally, our two businesses that serve the education space, CBORD & Horizon, declined double digits in the year, simply due to having a customer base that was shutdown. A decent amount of revenues in these businesses are tied to student volumes. Importantly, we acquired Vertafore last year. They're off to a great start with strong earnings and very strong cash flow in the fourth quarter. Looking to Q1, we see flat to low single digit organic growth based on continued mid single digit recurring revenue growth, offset slightly by lower perpetual and services revenues given last year's non-COVID comp. Now let's turn to our Network segment. Here, revenues were $1.74 billion, up 3% on an organic basis with EBITDA of $732 million. Our Network Software businesses performed well during last year, growing low single digits. Specifically, DAT was strong, growing double digits. DAT's network scale and innovation focus continues to enable very solid organic gains. ConstructConnect grew based on network utilization, tied to a tighter construction labor market. iTrade, MHA and Foundry had some headwinds tied to their end markets being disrupted due to COVID. That said, each of these businesses had high retention rates and the networks remain very strong. iPipeline also performed well during their first year being with Roper and completed two bolt-on acquisitions. Our non-software businesses struggled a bit during the year. Specifically, our rf IDEAS, are multi-protocol prudential [ph] reader business, did well in their health care applications, but was hampered by meaningful declines in their secure print market. For the full year, TransCore pushed about $100 million of revenue out of 2020 into 2021 associated with our New York project. In addition, EBITDA margins were pressured due to lower tag shipments and a few non-New York project push-outs. As we look to the first quarter of 2021, we see organic revenue, as you can see in the lower right-hand box, to be down 3% to 5% for the quarter. An important distinction to highlight, our software businesses will continue to grow in the low single digit range. But our non-software businesses, driven by TransCore will decline in the high-teens range in the first quarter due to much lower anticipated tag shipments and timing of revenue associated with the New York projects. As a reminder, the first quarter of this year is coming off a mid-teens growth comp from a year ago. Now let's turn to our MAS segment. Revenues for the year were $1.47 billion, up 1% on an organic basis with EBITDA of $508 million. Verathon was awesome in 2020. The business grew substantially based on unprecedented demand for their video intubation product line. Demand was global. Given Verathon's ability to fulfill this demand, we expect our meaningfully expanded installed base of GlideScope’s to generate increased levels of reoccurring consumables pull-through in the years to come. In addition, the first year of their Single-Use Bronchoscope release was successful. We believe we gained a substantial foothold in the market during the inaugural year of this product category. Our other med product businesses declined, but they started to see more normalized patient volumes towards the end of the year. Further, customer interactions are starting to resemble more normal levels in engagement. Neptune declined low double-digits tied exclusively to our customers in the Northeastern, US and Canada not having access to indoor meters. Other regions were flat during 2020. Neptune's market share remains strong throughout the year. Finally, our Industrial businesses were down, but have shown sequential improvements throughout the year. For Q1, we expect low single-digit organic growth for this segment with similar patterns to that of the fourth quarter. Now let's turn to our final segment, Process Tech. Revenues for the year were $519 million, down 21% on an organic basis with EBITDA of $156 million or 30% of revenue. Compared versus 2 years ago, these businesses are down about $90 million in EBITDA and yet maintained 30% EBITDA margins. Congrats and thanks to our leadership team for their continued exceptional execution. As a side note, Roper continued to compound despite these cyclical headwinds. That said, this segment is pretty straightforward and has been the same story all year. COVID has negatively impacted our oil and gas and short-cycle businesses. Certainly, lower oil prices did not help either. That said, we have seen some green shoots across the group, as capital spending started to improve as we exited 2020. As we look to the first quarter, we expect declines to moderate in the first quarter to be in the 10% range. Importantly, we have easing comps as we enter the second quarter. Also, over the last couple of years, these businesses continue to make product and channel investments to be best positioned to fully capture this cyclical upswing. The next few years here should be pretty good. Now let's turn to our guidance and the associated framework. While this slide is somewhat busy, we wanted to line-up for you the key macro differences between our 2021 full year outlook on a segment basis versus our actual 2020 results. In aggregate, we expect total revenue to increase in the mid teens range with organic growth being in the mid single digit-plus area.  As we look across the revenue streams for our Application & Software segment, we expect mid singles growth. Specifically, we expect a slightly improved recurring revenue growth rate, aided by last year's recurring momentum and an increased mix towards SaaS. We expect flat services revenues and mid single digit plus growth in Perpetual as we expect a modest market recovery and easing second half comps. Similarly, we expect mid single digit organic growth in our Network segment with our Network Software businesses growing mid single digit plus. We expect TransCore to complete the New York project and see recovering Tag sales. When combined, TransCore should grow mid singles for the year. We expect MAS to grow mid single digits as well. Our Medical Product businesses were exceptional last year, up 20%. Importantly, the quality of our medical products revenue stream will continue to improve as Verathon's reoccurring revenue streams tied to GlideScope and BFlex continue to gain momentum.  As we look to 2021, our Medical Product businesses are expected to grow low single digits, as elective procedures and hospital capital spending returned to more normalized levels throughout 2021, this return being partially offset by our difficult 2020 COVID comp. Neptune should be up high single digits plus with easing restrictions and more access to indoor meter replacements. And finally, our Industrial businesses should recover and grow in the high single digit plus range after 2 years of declines. Our PT businesses are expected to be up high single digits through the year based on the resumption of deferred projects and field maintenance, as well as modest improvements in these end markets. So all in all, we expect organic revenues to increase mid single digits plus and total revenue to grow in the mid teens range. Let's turn to our guidance slide. Based on what we just outlined, when you roll everything together, we're establishing our 2021 full year adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $14.35 and $14.75. Our tax rate should be in the 21% to 22% range. For the first quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $3.26 and $3.32. Of note, our guided Q1 adjusted DEPS is roughly 22% to 23% of our full year guidance range and is consistent with our long-term historical DEPS seasonality. Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. What a year. None of us will ever forget 2020. Our business performed so very well last year. We grew revenue 3% in aggregate and only declined a single percent on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were steady at 35.8%, and cash flow grew 16% to $1.7 billion. This means, we had cash flow margins of 30%, just amazing. Given this performance, our business model's ability to foresee this performance, we stayed focused on executing our capital deployment strategy, which resulted in $6 billion of deployment on high-quality, niche-leading, vertical software companies. There is no doubt the quality of our enterprise improved during 2020, something we're incredibly proud to be able to say. Our recurring revenue grew mid-single digits. We increased innovation investments and increased the quality of our portfolio with our capital deployment spend. So as we look to 2021, we feel we are incredibly well-positioned. We expect strong organic growth that will be further augmented by contributions from our recent acquisitions. In 2021, we expect about two-thirds of our EBITDA to come from our Software businesses, which provides us all the virtues of an increased mix towards recurring revenues. We will continue to focus on deleveraging our balance sheet, but we remain committed and focused on our long-term capital deployment strategy. To this end, our pipeline of M& A candidates is active, robust and has many high quality opportunities. So as we look back over 2020, we are proud of our business model's durability and our leaders' ability to successfully navigate last year's uncertainties. We are proud that we continue to be forward-leaning and strategic. We are proud that we improved our business last year with an increasing mix of growing recurring revenue and continued innovation focus. In short, we got bigger and better during 2020. As we turn to your questions, I'll remind everyone that at Roper, we operate a low-risk model whose strategy centers on acquiring fantastic businesses and then providing them with an environment where they can get even better over the long arc of time. This was certainly the case in 2020. So with that, let's turn to our first question.
Operator: We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Hey, good morning, Deane.
Rob Crisci: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Hey, I really appreciate all the new disclosures you're providing here, especially pages 14 and 20. Those bridges between your original guidance, what you delivered and then the organic bridge on 20 is really helpful, a lot of granularity there. And if we were to start, just because the New York City contract is such a high profile and it did have a swing factor, can you give us a sense of how much - just remind us the revenue you're expecting for the year, how much of it could land in the first quarter? And just confirm there's been no change in scope?
Rob Crisci: Yeah. So - hey, Deane, good morning. It's about $100 million for the full year. And in the first quarter, we only have about $10 million to $15 million in there. As we mentioned, there's a bit of a pause, but now it's started up and running again, and the scope is unchanged.
Deane Dray: Got it. And if you were to highlight all the areas where you're seeing improvement in licenses and the services pipeline, what's at the high end in terms of the businesses today?
Neil Hunn: Deane, maybe I can ask you to sort of rephrase the question. I want to make sure that we fully understand the question.
Deane Dray: Yeah. Just in terms of the licenses revenues that you're seeing today, you've taken us through where some of the challenges have been. What's on the upper-end of your guidance where you would see potentially the - how it would play out on the positive side?
Neil Hunn: Sure. Okay. So I appreciate the question. I think we understand it now. So the total perpetual revenue for our core businesses, the Software businesses that have been in the portfolio for a while was down obviously, in 2020. We expect about - the recovery in ‘21 to be about half of what we are down. We're seeing strength, you know, we've seen continued strength all year in the perpetual - in 2020 in the perpetual book of business, in Deltek's GovCon business. As I talked about in the prepared remarks, we're seeing - showing [ph] in some activity in their professional services end markets that's encouraging. These are the architects, the engineers, the contractors, the marketing services firms, the consulting firms, those - that book of business. In addition, the other large parts of the perpetual book are at Aderant and PowerPlan. Aderant has its own unique set of competitive factors where the customers have to – the customers that have not upgraded their software from - the competitive customers have not upgraded the software have to upgrade, and we're winning a large percentage of those. And so all that activity just got pushed to the right a bit, and that's somewhat encouraging and pipeline activity is positive there. And then PowerPlan's pipeline activity is full. It has a handful of large opportunities in it, which are obviously hard to predict the exact timing. But we actually like the pipeline build across, the companies that have the primary book of perpetual business.
Deane Dray: Okay. That's helpful. And just as my follow-up question would be for Rob. Do you have specific deleveraging plans for the year that you could share with us in terms of where and how? You said you'd be paying down the revolver, but just are there specific goals that you can share for 2021?
Rob Crisci: Sure. So it will be, as you know, when we're in deleveraging mode, all the free cash flow goes towards deleveraging. So we pay a dividend. That will continue. But essentially, the rest of the free cash flow goes towards deleveraging. So that's a rough - probably after you paying a dividend, roughly $1.5 billion in deleveraging is probably a good ballpark number.
Operator: Next question comes from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Christopher Glynn: Yeah. Thanks, good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Christopher Glynn: So congrats on all the capital allocation last year. I am just curious, you're getting a lot of inbounds after some of your sub-segment divisions. Given you had some real emphasis on quality and fullness of the pipeline, there's certainly liquidity in the markets. So wondering if your calculus has shifted towards any non-operating cash flow to fund the deleverage and trade back into the pipeline a little sooner?
Neil Hunn: Yeah. I appreciate the question. We - it's very routine for us to get inbounds. I've been here almost 10 years. And there's a handful of, what I would say, meaningful and credible inbounds in any given year. Like we said for years, though, it's just very difficult to make the math work because when we sell a business, just look back at Gatan, you sell a business to a strategic buyer, we leak taxes, then you have to redeploy it, it's just hard with a compounding orientation to make that math work. Certainly, the lower tax rate sort of helped in the Gatan timing. So yes, we get inbounds. I would not say the activity in the last few quarters has ramped up more than it's been over the decade I've been here. But yeah, there's always inbound inquiry.
Christopher Glynn: Any appetite to entertain that was the other part of that question.
Neil Hunn: Yeah. I think it's the appetite. We've never not had the appetite. It just comes down to the math and doing what's best in our view, according to our math for our shareholders. So it's - the appetite has – that remained unchanged.
Christopher Glynn: Understood. Thanks.
Neil Hunn: You're welcome.
Operator: The next question is from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Steve Tusa: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Hey, Steve.
Steve Tusa: The free cash was pretty strong in the fourth quarter, like almost 95% of EBITDA. Last couple of fourth quarters, it's been around 80%. What was the kind of overdrive there? And then when it comes to cash and EBITDA, how much did roughly did Vertafore add?
Rob Crisci: Vertafore was around 90% or so of both cash and EBITDA. And yeah, as I mentioned earlier, Steve, just great working capital performance across the portfolio, very broad-based. You're getting your software renewals, which were very strong in the fourth quarter. There is certainly is some benefit, right from those more cyclical businesses being a little bit softer, right? And that lowers working capital overall. But just great working capital performance. Our cash taxes year-over-year were about flat. So it really was all on working capital.
Steve Tusa: Got it. And then within the guidance, I guess, you didn't really quite - you don't usually guide for free cash flow for next year. I think you said $1.5 billion. Is that - is the $1.5 billion after the dividend? And then does that include any of the tax benefit that you guys bought with Vertafore, the benefit of that?
Rob Crisci: Yeah. So the $1.5 billion is deleveraging number, so that's an estimate. That's after paying dividends. So for next year, yeah, you're right, we don't guide free cash flow. We always have very strong conversion. As you know, we expect that very high conversion to continue. As I mentioned, those working capital trends are very stainable, right? It's the culture. It's the type of businesses we buy. As the software businesses grow, their working capital continues to go down, so that all should continue.  In terms of the tax attributes, yes, there are some tax attributes related to Vertafore, which we disclosed, a little over $100 million. So there'll be some benefit from that coming in '21. There's also, like many other multi-industry and really all companies, right, we benefited some from deferral of payroll taxes. So that I'll go back the other way next year as you're starting to pay those payroll taxes again. So those are sort of – the business sort of counter [ph] each other a little bit. But we feel great about cash flow next year. But we don't guide as you know. Operator Next question comes from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Allison Poliniak: Hi, guys. Good morning. 
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Allison.
Rob Crisci: Good morning, Allison.
Allison Poliniak: Just want to talk to you, obviously, the theme of reopening seems pretty pervasive in a number of your businesses. Could you help me understand maybe the progression of some of those businesses that you're thinking about if we, in fact, we do start to reopen here? Is it sort of an outsized bump, as things start to get back to work? Or is it more of a progression out of that, any thoughts?
Neil Hunn: Well, I'll give you the – it’s Neil. I'll give you the headline, and I'll let Rob sort of add his color on the back end. So it's not like a step function bump-up. It is a sort of sequential improvement throughout the year. Obviously, when you roll past Q1, the comps get a whole lot easier. So that's part of what the last three quarters of the year will look like as well. When you look at it on a company by - sorry segment-by-segment basis, just rolling through, basically, it's the perpetual book of business and the associated services that come with that for Application Software that ramps back up. In Network, they're really - for the Network businesses, it's a little bit of ramp back at foundry. It's a little bit of ramp back at iTrade. But the other businesses were pretty steady as she goes, DAT, ConstructConnect, et cetera. TransCore stands by itself. It's tied principally to two things, one is the New York project completing, and second, the return of traffic volumes and the associated tags that go with them. For the MAS segment, it's Neptune just sequentially coming back and importantly, getting the access to the indoor meters in Northeast, US and Canada. I said in the prepared remarks, market share was super steady, maybe plus a little bit in that business last year. It's just access - our customers getting access to do retain replacements. Verathon will have a difficult headwind because of the capital place we talked about. But the other Medical Product businesses just rotate up in a sequential basis. And then finally, the Industrial businesses do the same. Process is much like Industrial, just a cyclical rebound, modestly higher oil prices helped. But you have all this in the energy businesses, you have all this deferred maintenance that's got to get done. There's a lot of - there's sort of - there were some restocking orders in the fourth quarter there and then some pipeline activity like we got to get in and do the maintenance in a handful of these important customers. So that would be sort of the color of the ramp, but no step function. But Rob, what would you add if anything?
Rob Crisci: No, I think that's right. We're assuming Q1 is very much clearly still in the middle of pandemic and then things improve from there.
Allison Poliniak: Got it. And then in line with that, obviously, we've been under this closure for a significant amount of time. Any concerns of the financial impact of some of your existing customers that you would anticipate that ramp from or not at this point?
Neil Hunn: I would say no. And I think the – I mean, obviously, there's going to be small pockets here and there. We're very – most of our customers across the portfolio, most are enterprise level. A very small percentage of our software companies would be in the small, medium size where it may be more subject to some sort of macro sort of headwinds or business uncertainty. I think the data point we point to is just the incredible cash flow. I mean, we got paid by our customers, right, and so last year. And so what we do is just critical to what they do. And no, I don't think there's going to be down…
Rob Crisci: Yeah. The pockets of areas that are hit as we talked about, right colleges and universities, most of those customers we tend to have larger customers there. So we're not too worried about our schools being in financial trouble overall. And then on like the iTrade network side, they have customers that are in the food area. So there certainly could be an impact from some smaller restaurants and some of those issues in that market. But overall, not really a meaningful impact meaningful impact to us.
Operator: Next question comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Joe.
Rob Crisci: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Giordano: I'm in the market to refinance my mortgage at 1% blended, so can you guys help me out with the…
Neil Hunn: I have a guy in Florida, I never run through [ph] We will count that as the first question, by the way.
Joe Giordano: And then on the net working capital, obviously, that keeps getting more and more negative and more interesting. But with the current portfolio, where is that – what is like the maximum that, that can get to without doing more deals into that further push it that way?
Neil Hunn: Yeah. So I think if you go to our working capital page, page 10, you'll see all the benefit here. Q4 to Q4 was on the liability side, right? We're basically equal to – on the asset side, which is that, that indicates to us and we go business-by-business, it's structural and driven by an increasing mix towards software. So that's the first thing I'd say. Second is when you look at the art of the possible, if you think about a business that is 100% SaaS recurring revenue that's prepaid a year ahead, let's say, that you bill on January 1st and you take 90 days to get paid, that company is going to have 75% of its revenue. That's negative net working capital, right? And we certainly have a couple of businesses that don't quite get to 75%, but they approach 40% or 50%. So as we become more software and our legacy perpetual business becomes more Saas, you're going to see this number get higher. Will it ever get to 40% to 50%? No, it won't. But it will keep inching higher. It should over the next 5 to 10 years. We don't have a target. It's not that we're trying to drive the business to be x percent negative. We just have an incentive system and a culture that we get a little bit better every year on this metric.
Joe Giordano: That's definitely helpful to frame that up. Thanks. A follow-up would be on – I'm sorry, on Vertafore. How is that business doing since you've been there? Have you noticed anything like kind of - what kind of initial changes have been instituted, if any? And like when we did our diligence that was definitely a market like where - that business was a leader, but there was - that whole market seemed right for some change there. And how are you guys approaching that, are there upstarts that you look at? Is it an internal change that drives the market forward? Like how are you just approaching that business now?
Neil Hunn: Yeah. So the most important thing that I think we can say in regards to Vertafore that matter, any acquisition is that, you know, if we had to summarize what we do is we buy these amazingly great businesses and then provide them environment to get better over a long period of time. So as a result, there is not a short-term. We've got to do these five things to improve the business. That's not in our strategic M&A strategy. That said, the business is – and the piece of research you did we thought was quite good and reflective of ours. It's basically a duopoly. We share a market with one principal competitor on the agency side. Fortunately, for us, just after the business - we acquired the business and closed, we won the largest deal in the market in the last three or four years and assured partners. There was a press release that went out a handful of weeks ago. So we're delighted about that. It's a slow ramp over a couple of years, a couple, three years. I think that's just an indication of the quality of the business that Vertafore and the products they have. But also the customer, in that case, was reassured by being - by Vertafore being owned by Roper who is just a long-term owner that's not going to look to sell the business in a handful of years. And therefore, you can make the right investments. If there is one thing that we're, you know, if you well doing in the short run is based on our diligence and similar to work you did is, we wanted to allocate a little bit more to R&D, which we have done. That's reflected in the numbers we've given you from the very beginning. And so that's going to take a few years to play out, just continuing to add functionality and add features and ways to monetize their customer base.
Rob Crisci: Hey, and Joe, just on the - obviously, the company has performed very, very well since we own it. But just to clarify my last answer, the 90 of EBITDA, that's since we own the business, there's a month in there as well. It wasn't all in the fourth quarter. But it was 90 of cash in the fourth quarter.
Operator: The next question from Blake Gendron with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Blake Gendron: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. I want to follow-up on that R&D comment, actually, kind of in the broader context of your portfolio. So COVID was disruptive for a number of reasons, structurally with the end markets and I would imagine competitively. In addition to Vertafore and maybe ramping R&D there, are there any opportunities to ramp R&D across some of the other business units, simply because there's new market opportunities as a result of the pandemic moving forward? I know it's hard for us to really fully appreciate all the changes that will stick structurally across all your business units. But I'm just wondering if we should expect R&D to ramp a little bit across the portfolio, not just Vertafore?
Neil Hunn: Yeah. So a few things I'd say there to begin with. First is when we engage with each of our businesses strategically, we talk to them broadly about how to grow sustainably with CRI-accretive growth over a long arc of time. Answering the two questions of where to play and how to win, but then when you get into how to win, it is - sometimes it's a product answer. A lot of times, it's a go-to-market or market, go-to-market effective sort of answer. So it's not - our strategic orientation of each business doesn't narrow into innovation from the get-go. That said, obviously, innovation and R&D, more mostly a D shop [ph] mostly development across our software and product businesses. You have seen and likely will continue to see a modest increase in R&D spend as a percent of revenue for years to come. In ‘19, it was about 7.5%, last year, it's about a little over 8%. This coming year, probably going to add about 100 basis points, to be a little over 9%. There's Vertafore mix in there that they have a little bit higher percentage, as compared to some of our other businesses. But I think you will see and are seeing an increase in innovation there. So – I’d sort of stop there. I mean, if you have any follow-ups, we're happy to do it. But the short answer is yes. I guess there's one other thing. If you compare Roper's, the 8% or 9% of revenue that we spend in R&D compared to other software companies, it appears low. When you look at our Software businesses, we're right in line with the peers. We're between 10% and 15%, 17% depending on the company. The Application businesses tend to be on the higher side of that. The Network businesses tend to be on the lower side of that. And the reason the mix for Roper is low is because we have quite a bit of revenue in TransCore, MHA and others that effectively don't have any R&D in our business model. So it's always important to point out when we get asked a question about R&D.
Blake Gendron: That's helpful to think about the framework there. I wanted to shift to Deltek. I thought it was interesting when you mentioned GovCon's stability versus maybe some of the professional services being impacted by COVID. The GovCon, I would imagine you're dealing with large enterprise customers. So we should expect it to be kind of stable in addition to just general government spending being stable? On the professional side, is it just a matter of reopening? Or is there anything we can think about with respect to customer size, large versus SMB? And then maybe end markets specifically that we should be looking at for the recovery? Is it just non-residential construction on the AEC side? How should we think about Deltek improvement in 2021 and beyond?
Neil Hunn: I’ll give you a gold star for getting like seven questions into one question. So I'm going to do our best to try to come - tick through these. So on Deltek, it is - it's important to note. It is a combination of large enterprise and the smaller end of the GovCon space that's been super strong throughout the year. It's not just been at the high end. And yes, we expect that to just continue, as the - it's not tied to infrastructure, per se. These government contractors go toward the fast currents of government spend is. It's gone from military to educations, maybe infrastructure. They just go to where it is, that might drive some M&A activity, by the way, which is generally good for us. On the Professional services side, the book of business here is broad. But if there are pockets of concentration, it's in architects, engineers and contractors. Obviously, the contractors, mostly non-res contractors, in this case, they are the ones that are a little bit worried, and they've sort of tightened up a little bit more. It's the architects and engineering firms that have shown some green shoots here in Q4. In addition, marketing services firms is a leading niche for Deltek, and those businesses also have started to fall. So I think that checked off your questions. If we missed one or two, we're happy to follow-up with you after the call.
Operator: The next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey. Morning everyone. This is Joao on for Julian.
Neil Hunn: Hey, good morning.
Unidentified Analyst: Maybe to start with, could we get your thoughts on maybe margin expectations for the segment? Obviously, a lot of movement in the software margins in 2020, kind of a lot of mix shift you guys are calling out on that slide 20, so I just wanted to get your thoughts there?
Rob Crisci: Yeah. I mean, we can go through the segments in detail later on. But I mean, overall, our margins are relatively flat year-over-year in the guide. I think there's a little bit of a core decline in the margins, given a lot of the cost will come back post-COVID, travel and things that didn't happen, very modest decline there. And then the Vertafore revenue comes in at a higher margin. So overall, margins were relatively flat. And then we'd expect some improvement in the bottom sort of the more cyclical type stuff and process, we should get some nice bounce back as that starts to grow in margins.
Neil Hunn: And if I could just add one thing there, sort of piggybacking your question with the last one. Core EBITDA margins are going to be down a bit because, as Rob said, these costs are coming back in. It's hard to spend money on travel and customer meetings, for instance, last year, and we expect some of that to come back in this year.  That said, I sort of call it like a trap of leadership. We're increasing our R&D as a percent of revenue by about the same amount that we expect the core margins to come down. So there's going to be - some teams and some companies may choose to hold margins, and they're going to have to - there's opportunity cost inside the business somewhere. In our case, we're very specifically and intentionally not doing that versus coming to that trap. And then obviously, we get the benefit of the Vertafore mix coming in. So on - in aggregate, margins should be flat to up a touch.
Unidentified Analyst: Perfect. Thanks. And then maybe on the services piece of Application Software, you guys talk about kind of rebuilding that pipeline. What does that process look like? And any thoughts on some of the cadence or just kind of expectations beyond that sort of flat growth you guys guided for?
Rob Crisci: Yeah. I think - so what you have here is a dynamic where the most - first as a precursor. Most - the vast majority, I should say of our services work in the application segment are tied to new implementations, whether they're SaaS or on-premise. So if you look back and think through what happened sequentially in 2020, very quickly in the shutdown, the license activity, the perpetual activity slowed down. So you had low license activity basically through Q4. The services book of business has a little bit of a backlog, right? So the services were continued in Q2, continued a little bit in Q3, completed the in-flight projects. And then it sort of slowed down a handful of months behind the license activity. So when you comeback on this side, the license activity will pick up sooner, but then you got to - and the services work will follow back behind it. So you've essentially had a slower ramp down and a slower ramp up for services. So that's why you see it flattish where you can see growth in the perpetual book.
Operator: Your next question comes from Alex Blanton of Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please go ahead.
Alex Blanton: Hi. Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Alex.
Rob Crisci: Good morning, Alex. Good to hear you.
Alex Blanton: I wanted to ask, could you characterize your acquisition intentions for 2021? You had said earlier that it would be primarily - would be deleveraging for 12 to 18 months. But today, you mentioned that you had a very active, robust pipeline of potential acquisitions with many opportunities, so has there been a change in your intentions there in terms of deleveraging? How would you characterize the acquisition outlook for this year?
Neil Hunn: Thank you, Alex for the question. So I would share two things with you. First is, maybe more than a couple of things. So we are active. The pipeline is active. We are spending time with - learning businesses, spending time with all the sponsors that we have relationships with to understand what the cohort of opportunities looks like. Importantly, every sizable transaction that we've completed since 2016, we have had a chance to meet the management teams at least once, if not multiple times, anywhere between 6 months and 18 months before we completed the transaction. So the work that we're doing now is principally focused on that. These are getting to understand businesses well before they're ready to be transacted, right? So businesses we're meeting this month are likely going to be businesses that we may acquire at the end of this year, or into the first half of next year. So it's the early pipeline work is the first thing I would say. Second is we're absolutely committed to deleveraging or unwavering on that. Third thing, if the right deal came through, there's always a way to figure that out. But that's not our primary focus. Our primary focus is the early part of the pipeline build, as well as the deleveraging.
Alex Blanton: Okay. And secondly, how would you characterize the makeup of these companies that you're getting to know. What industries? Is it still primarily software? Are you still going in that direction?
Neil Hunn: Absolutely. It's – again, we're characterized, our M&A pipeline and process characterized by buying businesses that are better than us through the – our quantitative cash return lens. So that yields mostly software informatics types businesses. They're a combination of a wide variety of end markets, a wide variety of SaaS versus perpetual business models. But yeah, it's essentially what the capital deployment over the last 7 to 10 years. It's what our pipeline is characterized by that same type of business.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-27 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions].  I would like now to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the third quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. We hope everyone is doing well. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.  Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now, if you'll please turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release, and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now, please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenue and related commission expense, transaction related expenses for completed acquisitions. And lastly, we've adjusted our cash flow results to exclude income tax payments deferred from Q2 to Q3 due to COVID-19 and cash taxes paid for the Gatan divestiture. As a reminder, GAAP requires tax payments for a gain on sale to be classified as an operating cash flow item, even though it is related to a divestiture.  And now if you please turn to Slide 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Neil? 
Neil Hunn : Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Let's go ahead and get into this morning's content. And as we always do, we'll start by reviewing our agenda. I'll begin discussing our enterprise highlights for the quarter, which was a very busy and very productive quarter for us. To that end, I'll briefly review our acquisition activity. Rob will then discuss our financial performance and capital market activity. Afterwards, I'll walk through a detailed segment review and associated outlook, followed by our enterprise fourth quarter and raised full year guidance. We will then look forward to your questions.  Now with that, let's turn to a brief run through of our Q3 enterprise highlights. Next slide please. Third quarter demonstrated the strength our execution capabilities. First, on an operating basis. Second, on a capital deployment basis. And finally, from a capital markets perspective. Operationally, our revenues and EBITDA continue to grow, albeit modestly, despite the well documented economic challenges resulting from the pandemic situation we're all facing.  At a summary level, our software recurring revenues continue to grow. Recurring revenue growth is very important for us. This indicates high levels of retention, demonstrates our ongoing and increasing relevance we have with our customers and provides for a more stable and predictable forward financial model. However, as anticipated, we experienced modest declines in our perpetual license revenue tied to lower levels of market activity across a few of our software end markets and a difficult comp from a year ago. We discussed this on each of our last few calls, COVID is absolutely driving faster adoption of our SaaS or cloud-based recurring revenue solutions. This is a very healthy and positive trend.  Separately, we continue to see very nice momentum for our products and software used in the fight against COVID. Most notably, our laboratory software businesses continue to see strong demand as we're helping stand up and maintain health system and country level COVID testing capability. In addition, Verathon, our largest medical product business continues to drive meaningful market adoption across their video intubation product line.  The final operating item I'll point out here is, at the onset is the fact that Neptune and our short cycle industrial businesses started to rebound in the quarter from which we draw encouragement. From a financial point of view, our organic revenues declined 3%. Our gross margin were 64% and our operating profitability remained very strong with 37% EBITDA margins. Most importantly, we grew our cash flow double-digits again. Turning to our acquisition activities, we completed four acquisitions for a total of $5.8 billion of capital deployment, certainly led by our $5.35 billion acquisition of Vertafore. More on these when we turn to our next slide.  Finally, the team was successful in the debt capital markets completing a $2.7 billion bond offering with a blended rate of 1.3% and increasing our revolver capacity to $3 billion that has an extended maturity date. I'm super proud of our execution in this quarter with all three phases of our offense on full display: Solid operating performance across the enterprise; $5.8 billion of CRI accretive capital deployment; and successfully executing a capital market transaction at extremely favorable interest rates. Now let's turn to our next slide and talk to our recent acquisitions. Okay, this was a very strong quarter for us relative to our capital deployment strategy. As we mentioned for several calls, the quality and quantity of ideas in our M&A pipeline has been robust for quite some time. We were very selective in our approach for landing on these acquisitions highlighted on this page. First, we completed the acquisition of Vertafore for $5.35 billion. I refer you to the call we did just after announcing this transaction for all the relevant details. But the highlight, Vertafore is a business that delivers cloud-based software to the property and casualty insurance industry principally in United States. Vertafore’s focus is straightforward, to simplify, automate and drive productivity across the complex and highly regulated processes in the P&C space. Today, the business serves over 20,000 independent agencies, 1,000 insured carriers and touches over 140 billion of premiums per year. And high quality management teams motivated to build their businesses are super important for us. And to that end, Amy and her team have done a tremendous job building this business over the last several years. We expect Vertafore will deliver about $590 million of revenue and $290 million of EBITDA next year.  Separately, we announced and closed three strategic add-ons, one for Strata, and two for iPipeline. Relative to Strata, we acquired EPSi. As reminder, both Strata and EPSi deliver decision support, financial planning and analytic software solutions that help hospitals manage their cost structure, and identify opportunities for operational improvements. Strata, when combined with EPSi, would serve over 400 health systems and 2000 hospitals. The aggregate spending power of this combined customer base is approximately $1 trillion, or about 25% of the total healthcare spend in the U.S. The combination of Strata and EPSi will be a powerful one for the market and our customers. Relative by iPipeline, we acquired both WELIS and IFS. WELIS is a nice product tuck-in that enhances iPipeline’s life insurance and annuity illustration capability. For those who don't know, the illustration is the modeled value calculation that permanent insurance carriers are required to provide to their insurers. IFS enhances iPipeline's capabilities to better serve the financial planning channel relative to life insurance account management. We expect these three bolt-ons will deliver about $75 million of revenue and $30 million of EBITDA next year. We're looking at each of these deals either individually or together, they are right down the middle for us. Each business has very strong cash flow capability, which is punctuated by being super asset light. Also, these businesses are, as our most Roper businesses, market leaders in their niche. Over the years when we refer to niche we mean smaller markets. We like small markets, small towns provide deterrence for new potential entrance. On top of this, these and other Roper businesses provide deeply verticalized solutions. By this, we mean solutions that are specifically developed to address unique industry workflows or challenges.  It is at the cross section of; one, being the market leader; two, operating in smaller markets; and three, delivering vertical solutions that enable our businesses to have intense customer intimacy. This intimacy enables our businesses to invest at the pace our customers require. Importantly, these four businesses have very high levels of recurring revenue. For instance, Vertafore has over 90% returns.  Finally, these businesses grow nicely on an organic basis. Their growth drivers are diversified and are multiple. We expect these businesses to grow mid-single-digits over the long arc of time. Taken together, the $5.8 billion in capital deployment should deliver about $665 million in revenue, and $320 million of EBITDA to our enterprise in 2021. In a few pages, Rob will discuss our financing package for these deals which as you likely know by now was quite good.  So now, I'm going to hand it over to Rob, but look forward to discussing our activities here more during the Q&A. Rob, your ball.
Rob Crisci : Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest as always in Roper Technologies. Turning to Page 7, looking at our Q3 income statement performance. Total revenue increased 1% to $1.369 billion. Organic revenue for the enterprise declined 3% versus prior year, similar to what we saw in Q2 and about what we would expect for Q4 as the pandemic continues.  We had positive organic revenue growth in both Network Software & Systems and Measurement & Analytical Solutions. We had a slight organic decline in Application Software due to the difficult perpetual license comp we discussed last quarter. Lastly, and similar to Q2, we experienced a 25% decline in our smallest segment, Process Technologies. Margin performance was once again quite strong with gross margin of 64.2% and EBITDA margin down 10 basis points versus prior year, but up quite a bit sequentially to 36.6%. EBITDA grew in the quarter despite the pandemic to a Q3 record of $501 million.  Tax rate came in at 22.2%, which was a couple of points higher than last year. So that all results in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.17 which was well above our guidance range aided by both better organic performance and some accretion from our Vertafore acquisition. So once again, strong execution by our business leaders in a very challenging environment.  Next slide, turning to Page 8 on net working capital. Here we look at the three year trend on working capital which continues to improve. You may recall we exited last quarter with negative working capital of minus 5.4%. And now we further improved working capital as a percent of revenue down to minus 6.3%. Continuing to improve on these important working capital metrics, despite the challenging macro environment really is a testament to the excellent work of our finance organizations across the Roper Enterprise. Our people do a really good job of focusing on what matters. We will see more evidence of this as we move forward to look at cash flow and cash conversion on the next few slides.  Next slide. Turning to Page 9 on compounding cash flow. Really amazing as Neil had mentioned to have our third straight quarter of double-digit cash flow growth in 2020. As we discussed last quarter, for better compatibility and clarity, we adjusted our results for the $124 million of cash tax payments that were deferred from Q2 to Q3 due to COVID-19. So that adjustment hurt our numbers in Q2 and helps us in Q3 but has no net impact on our year-to-date results. Next year, we expect the IRS to return back to their normal schedule.  We do have one additional adjustment this quarter, as Zack mentioned, for the $192 million of cash taxes that we paid in the quarter that were due from the 2019 Gatan divestiture. So none of those adjustments, Q3 operating cash flow grew 12% to $454 million, which represented 33% of revenue. Q3 free cash flow grew 14% to $442 million, which represented 32% of revenue. And you can see on the right hand side on a year-to-date basis, our adjusted free cash flow was up 13% to $1.1 billion. So as a takeaway reads, really consistent cash flow performance in a very challenging environment.  Next slide, on Page 10, turning to Roper's strong cash conversion. So through three quarters of 2020, 28% of our revenue and 78% of our EBITDA has converted to free cash flow. So comparing our 2020 year-to-date to our full year cash conversion over the past few years, we actually see that we are trending ahead of where we've been historically on cash conversion. Even better, Q4 is typically a seasonally strong quarter for cash conversion driven by annual billing cycles and lower tax payments. So, we are quite confident we are heading for a very strong cash result in 2020. Our consistently high cash conversion is important because it further demonstrates the high quality of our EBITDA, which allows us to quickly and predictably reduce leverage after large acquisitions. Next slide, turning to Page 11, updating on our balance sheet. So you can see here where we stand after the completion of the Vertafore acquisition in September. Our cash balance is reduced to a normal level of about $300 million, down from $1.8 billion at the end of the second quarter. That excess cash was used to partially fund the acquisitions. Net debt to trailing EBITDA ended the quarter at 4.8 times. Importantly, this calculation does not include the pro forma impacts of the Vertafore acquisition. Including a full year of Vertafore’s EBITDA would push this ratio down into the low 4s. We expect our leverage to decline quickly over the next year as the EBITDA flows through and we use our generated cash flow to reduce our debt.  Next slide. So on Page 12, we'll talk about the financing activities that occurred in the third quarter. Including the EPSi deal that closed in October, we recently deployed a little over $5.8 billion of capital financed by our excess cash on hand, a meaningful amount of which was generated from last year's Gatan divestiture, new investment grade debt and a draw on our credit facility. We launched a bond offering in August and benefited from strong demand from Roper's debt investors, consistent with what we had experienced when we accessed the high grade bond market in June. So we ended up spreading the $2.7 billion of principal over four tranches which resulted in a very good blended interest rate of 1.3% and duration of a little over seven years. Notably, and importantly, no changes to Roper credit ratings. We remain triple B plus at S&P and Baa2 at Moody's and we remain committed to maintaining solid investment grade ratings moving forward.  We also successfully extended our revolving credit facility out three years and also upsized it from $2.5 billion to $3 billion. The current floating borrowing rate on the revolver is about 1.2%. So we like to strike a balance between fixed rate debt and prepayable floating debt to enable us to delever quickly.  So in summary, these financing activities are consistent with our long-term strategy of augmenting our internally generated cash flow with investment grade debt. Then we use our consistent and durable cash flow generation to rapidly reduce leverage, which we plan to do over the next 12 to 18 months.  So with that, I'll pass it back over to Neil.
Neil Hunn : Thanks, Rob. Let's turn to our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $451 million, down 1% on an organic basis; EBITDA was $201 million or 44.6% of revenue. Similar to the way we started our commentary about this segment during our last call, our retention rates and thus our recurring revenues remained strong in the quarter. In addition, we're continuing to see an acceleration of our Software as a Service or cloud solutions across this segment. This trend will provide a long-term benefit for both our customers and for our business. Our customers outsource the operations of their software applications to us and gain the benefit of being on the most recent software release at all times. Our businesses are improved by having higher levels of recurring revenue and customer intimacy. Importantly, we believe this migration to the cloud will be a net growth driver for us. So based on this SaaS migration trend, and our continued high levels of customer retention, we saw recurring revenues grow mid-single-digits in the quarter. We expect this strength to continue into next year. As an offset, and as expected, we saw declines in our perpetual revenue stream for two reasons: first, a difficult prior year license comp; and second, a slowing of new logo licenses associated with the current macro headwinds.  Things remain solid at Deltek. We saw normalized bookings increase double-digits in the quarter, coming off very large perpetual bookings a quarter ago. They were seeing particular strength across their GovCon offerings and with their subscription content solutions. Recurring revenues are up double-digits versus this time last year. And as you'll note towards the bottom of this page, a business that has been negatively impacted in this segment is CBORD. To remind everyone, CBORD designs and delivers K-12 and university campus integrated security and nutrition management solutions. Given the fact that many educational campuses are deferring in-person attendance, this business is negatively impacted in the short run. As soon as in-person classes resume, we expect CBORD to return to normal levels of growth. Our laboratory software businesses, Sunquest, Data Innovations and CliniSys all performed nicely, aided by global demand to deploy laboratory software associated with combating COVID-19. A good example we're talking about here is the activity CliniSys is helping drive. Specifically, CliniSys is the IT backbone for the French and Belgian national COVID testing programs. You'll also note from the page that Data Innovations, our diagnostic middleware business, had record orders in the quarter, congrats to the team at Vermont. With this being said, we do expect some of this COVID strength to moderate going forward. Also, we continue to see strength in Strata. One of the nice perks of having Strata in the family of business is this learning from their hospital analytics. From Strata's research, we know that hospital volumes are normalizing in the 90% to 95% pre-COVID level. In addition, most hospitals have enacted cost measures to right-size their operating structures for this level of patient activity. Given our healthcare, IT and medical product businesses primarily serve the hospital market, we take confidence that patient volumes are coming back and hope to see the associated hospital capital spending come back online next year. Finally, we will be reporting Vertafore and the EPSi-Strata bolt-on in this segment. As we turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect this segment to be flat on an organic basis, principally for the reasons just discussed. We expect to see continued high levels of recurring revenue retention. As a reminder, the vast majority of our customers in this segment are enterprise or larger companies. That said, we do anticipate some continued pressure on our upfront software license sales. We're encouraged by seeing our sales pipeline activity being higher than this time a year ago, but we continue to expect our new logo prospects decision timeframes to extend longer than our historical experience, which leads deals likely moving into next year. All-in-all, we expect flat organic growth, but with a higher-quality revenue mix towards recurring versus perpetual. With that, next slide, please. Now let's turn to our Network segment. Revenues here increased 1% organically to $430 million. EBITDA was $180 million or 41.8% of revenue. I'd like to start, and as a reminder, that our software businesses in this segment principally share highly recurring SaaS revenue models, which are further aided by strong network effects that drive high retention rates, which was certainly the case in this quarter. The entire segment, similar to that of the Application Software segment, we saw mid-single-digit organic increases in recurring revenue.  ConstructConnect continues to perform well. Their network expanded in the quarter and was driven by strong customer adds and network utilization. DAT continues to post record quarters. This quarter is highlighted by record net addition of carriers to the network and enterprise brokerage seats fully recovering to pre-COVID. In addition, iPipeline's SHP and SoftWriters all continue to be strong. A couple of our software businesses in this segment are facing modest headwinds, each of which are short-term and tied to COVID-related economic activity. iTrade is being negatively impacted as food volumes in institutional settings, such as restaurants and sporting events are down. As these activities come back online, so will iTrade's growth. Also, MHA was down a bit in the third quarter as well, directly resulting from patient volumes and long-term care being down. We expect MHA to recover starting in the fourth quarter. Of note, during the quarter, Foundry was awarded their first Engineering Emmy Award for visual effect innovation used in television. The team at Foundry are super excited as they should be for this recognition, congrats. Finally, the TransCore New York City congestion pricing infrastructure project continues. However, the project at the election of our customer continues to slow and be pushed into 2021. Execution of the project remains quite strong, but the timing continues to elongate. In addition, a few other projects are slightly delayed as we near go live, causing some revenue and margin pressure in this segment. Now let's turn to our outlook for this segment. We see low-single-digit organic growth for the final quarter of the year. We continue to see growth and resiliency in our Network Software businesses driven by high recurring revenue mix, strong retention rates, and expanding networks and network participation. Relative to TransCore, we continue to see the New York City project pushing to the right. A few other projects being delayed and lower tag shipments due to the lower levels of vehicle traffic in 2020. All-in-all, again, we expect low-single-digit organic growth for the final quarter of the year. Next slide, please. Turning to our Measurement & Analytical segment. Revenues grew 2% organically to $368 million. EBITDA was $131 million or 35.7% of revenue. With the current pandemic backdrop, this segment's activities continue to be best broken into 4 boxes. One, Verathon and IPA; two, other medical product businesses; three, Neptune; and fourth, our industrial businesses. First, Verathon continues to experience high levels of demand for their GlideScope video intubation solutions. In this quarter, orders remained strong, and the company is able to clear much of the backlog that entered the quarter. As a result of COVID-19, the percentage of all intubations, not just COVID related that are being done using video assistance has meaningfully increased. We expect video assisted intubation market share to remain above pre-COVID levels going forward, which is a great long-term and recurring benefit for Verathon's business model. IPA continues to be strong as well. Second, and relative to our other medical product businesses, we did see revenue headwinds tied directly to lower patient volumes within acute care hospitals. We also note this group of companies normally grow mid-single-digits, but this growth is conditioned on normalized hospital activity. As hospital capital budgets begin to free up in 2021, we expect these businesses to return to a more normal state at some point next year. Third, Neptune improved sequentially but the pace of recovery was hampered a bit by continued restricted access to indoor meters, in particular, in the Northeast United States and Canada. Finally, and as expected, we did see recovery across our shorter-cycle industrial businesses. As we turn to the fourth quarter outlook, this will be the last quarter we have Gatan results in our prior period given its divestiture was in the fourth quarter of last year. For the fourth quarter, we expect to see low-single-digit growth for this segment, led by continued strong but moderating demand at Verathon. Given the strength in 2020, Verathon continues to accelerate investments in both product and go-to-market areas. In addition, we do expect to see our other medical product businesses improve from historic lows, but as discussed, hospital spending continues to be somewhat uncertain for the near term.  We expect to see continued improvements at Neptune as they gain more access to indoor meters. And finally, we expect to see continued but likely modest short-cycle industrial improvement. Next slide, please. Now turning to the segment that represents 9% of our revenue, Process Technologies. Revenues were $120 million in the quarter, down 25% on an organic basis. EBITDA was $34 million or 28.4% of revenue. While these businesses are facing incredible market headwinds, they continue to demonstrate their resiliency with their 28% plus EBITDA margins. As we said for the last couple of quarters, this, too, was a difficult quarter for these businesses, and we expect the outlook to remain poor for the balance of the year. We saw our upstream businesses decline approximately 40%. CCC was weak based on their inability to perform field service work, again, related to COVID. Cornell declined on weakness in their rental markets but did grow in many of their other end markets. And a bright spot in the quarter was Zetec, which experienced growth based on the strength in their new non-disruptive testing products.  The outlook for the fourth quarter continues to be an extremely challenging one as we expect to see approximately 20% organic declines. Specifically, we do not anticipate any recovery in upstream oil and gas markets but do anticipate sequential and seasonal improvement from many of the other businesses in this segment. Next slide, please. As we turn to our guidance, we are raising our full year adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $12.55 and $12.65 per share. The increase is principally attributed to the acquisitions closed since our last call. Full year revenue and EBITDA are expected to increase in the range of 2% to 3%. Our organic revenue outlook for the full year now leans to be flat to slightly down, perhaps 1% or so. Back in April, we guided revenues to be plus or minus flat, now flat to down 1%. While there are several puts and takes, the primary assumption that changed is the substantial amount of revenue tied to the TransCore New York City project pushing into 2021. The majority of other businesses have improved versus our April outlook. For the fourth quarter, we are establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.39 and $3.49 per share. We expect consolidated organic growth to be similar to that of the third quarter. Our tax rate for the quarter is expected to be about 20%. Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. In closing, I'll recap with what we started. Strong execution across the three parts of our offense: operational; capital deployment; and capital markets. Operationally, revenue grew 1% overall and declined 3% on an organic basis. EBITDA grew and margins remained strong. Most importantly, free cash flow grew 14% in the quarter. Throughout this year, our asset-light niche and market-leading businesses remain focused on investing for higher levels of long-term and sustainable organic growth. As such, this year, we are seeing increased levels of R&D across many of our businesses. Also, and it's worth repeating, we meaningfully enhanced our portfolio by successfully deploying $5.8 billion. Following these acquisitions, two-thirds of Roper's EBITDA will be generated from our software group of businesses. These acquisitions further add to our recurring revenue profile and our ability to compound our cash flows moving forward. Given our recent capital deployment and our commitment to investment-grade ratings, we are focusing our efforts for the next few quarters on operating our businesses and generating our durable cash flow, which will allow us to delever just as we did following our Deltek acquisition in 2016. So with all of this, we continue to be bullish about the coming quarter, about 2021 and about our longer-term future. And finally, and relative to our long-term strategy model, I'll conclude by highlighting, we compound cash flow. That's our job. Our cash flows are remarkably durable as demonstrated this year. We do this by operating a portfolio of businesses that have leading positions in small, niche and growing markets. Also, our businesses, whether our product or software, deliver highly application-specific or vertical solutions. Taken together, our businesses are awarded with intense customer intimacy. This intimacy allows us to innovate at the pace required by our customers. Our businesses have high-margin and asset-light economic models that naturally generate high levels of operating cash flow as they grow. To this end, we incent our management teams based on growth. And finally, we take the excess free cash flow generated by our businesses. And by this, we mean the cash flow that the businesses generate beyond investments required to drive organic growth, combine it with investment-grade leverage, and acquire businesses that have better cash returns than our existing company, that in turn, improve Roper and further accelerate our cash flow compounding. This very model, this very strategy, are the simple ideas that deliver our powerful results. So with that, let's get to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray : I was hoping you could quantify the revenue push out for the New York City congestion tolling project. We've been thinking $30 million in the fourth quarter. So that's obviously lower, but hopefully you can quantify that. And can you clarify whether there's been any change in scope? Or are these pushouts more as a result of COVID kind of logistics?
Neil Hunn : Yes, Dean, it's Neil. I'll take the second half of your question and give the first half to Rob. So scope is completely unchanged. The project continues, it's just slower, pushing a little bit as we discussed in the prepared remarks into next year. But yes, the scope is fully intact.
Rob Crisci: Yes. So it's continuing, as Neil mentioned. And so there's now, we've got about $100 million for the project this year, right? So maybe that's down $10 million or so versus what we said last quarter.
Deane Dray : Got it. And then I don't know if it would be Neil or Rob, but could you expand the point on fourth quarter seasonality. Maybe you can start with the free cash flow expectations because just given the macro, you're concerned about what might be seasonally normal, what might not happen or play out the same? And then within the businesses, is there -- just remind us on where and how you would expect a seasonal impact in the fourth quarter?
Rob Crisci : Sure. So on cash flow, as I mentioned earlier, we feel great about where the conversion is year-to-date and Q4 is generally a high cash conversion quarter because of the annual billing of the software businesses. And the fact that we don't have -- most of the tax payments are usually in the first half of the year. So tax payments are less in the fourth quarter. On the seasonality. So yes, I think it's a good point. I mean, normally, if you go back historically, right, when Roper was more of the cyclical businesses, as a percent, you'd get the Q4 bump in what used to be our energy segment. So there's some of that. I think, sequentially, we still have -- it's just a very small part of Roper, what's happening this year, as Neil mentioned, is our medical product businesses, really specifically, Verathon had an enormous second and third quarter driven by the COVID surge. And so their fourth quarter versus the third quarter is down about $30 million of revenue. And they're still up quite a bit year-over-year. And we're hopeful that happens, right? If the COVID surge gets worse, then Verathon will sell more products, but we're hoping that doesn't happen. So that's what's all included in our guidance for Q4.
Operator: Our next question will come from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Allison Poliniak : Just want to go to your comments around iTrade and Foundry. Understanding COVID is certainly having disruption. But obviously, those markets are quite a bit more challenged than maybe others. Are you seeing any sort of longer-term impairment to some of those customers? Any color?
Neil Hunn: No, I don't think so at all. Take iTrade, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, I mean, that business is partially indexed to sort of the institutional food, and that's also partially indexed to retail. So institutional down, retail up, it just balances a little bit towards the negative. The renewal rates for the more institutional side have been fine. There's no -- they're not dropping off. Obviously, the contract sizes have gotten a little smaller, but the retention rates of the actual customers are the same. On Foundry, Foundry has had a good year. Recurring revenues are up. The EBITDA is up in that business. It's just there's the way that the flow of work happens in converting live production into post and to releasing content, either film or television. There was a fair amount of backlog being worked on in the first half of the year. Then there was this pause in 2Q of live action, came back on slowly in Q3. It's fully ramped up right now across the globe. That creates more content for post. And so there's a couple of quarters inside the middle of this year where the number of net new software sales to new customers paused or waned a bit, but the recurrence was high and we expect that to fully bounce back as the pipeline is filling back up with content.
Allison Poliniak : Understood. And then just kind of going back to TransCore and some of the other projects. Anything tied to municipal in your portfolio that you're starting to see incremental challenges or delays there?
Neil Hunn: I would say no. I mean, if you -- on the municipal side, the -- on TransCore, no, I mean, the bidding activity, the sort of the sales pipeline of the TransCore are quite good. There are a large number of projects that are sort of in the process of being awarded now. So that's a good leading indicator. The municipal budgets at Neptune are largely intact and then renewed and sort of dollars are being spent against them on that municipal side. So no, I mean, I think we feel pretty good about the spending -- the budgets that are out there to be spent across the municipal parts of our business.
Rob Crisci : Yes. It’s really just project slowing, which is probably mostly due to COVID, right? It's just things are just taking longer to get going at TransCore for the most part.
Operator: Our next question will come from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Christopher Glynn : So I was curious about Sunquest. It sounds like you have some fresh momentum going there. Are you moving past the kind of net attrition, modest slide that, that business has been seeing?
Neil Hunn: So I’d characterize Sunquest -- hey, they've had just a great year. They're actually going to be up a little bit in EBITDA this year versus last year. Based on all the activities going on around COVID and a little bit of strength we're seeing in the diagnostic, the molecular part of their business, a new product offering and some public health offerings they have as well. That said, I think we still got -- I sort of view this year as a pause in the longer-term trend. I would expect that business to have faced a little bit, maybe a year or so, maybe it's hard to pinpoint it precisely, but call it a year to 2 of headwinds, then it will normalize, stabilize and get back into sort of maybe a low-single-digit organic growth sort of business.
Christopher Glynn : Okay. And as you're focused on debt reduction in the next year, year and a half, would you still anticipate some EPSi or WELIS type of additions to existing platforms?
Neil Hunn: It was going to be -- the bar is very high for those. It wouldn't surprise me. That said, if there was a little bit of bolt-on activity, but our principal focus here is to deleverage for the next year or so.
Operator: Our next question will come from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Steve Tusa : Can you just give us some color on how, with a little more precision, your revenue performed in license, maintenance and recurring? I mean, you guys are definitely giving a lot more really solid color directionally on this stuff. But just love to understand, you can talk about it enterprise-wise, if you want. Just a little more precision on kind of how those 3 buckets performed in the quarter?
Rob Crisci: Yes. So I think overall, recurring revenue, which right is maintenance plus subscription, as I think Neil mentioned earlier, was up mid-single digits. The license and the services piece is impacted by COVID, as we talked about all throughout the year. So there's some declines there, and that's what we get you to that. Basically, overall, the software businesses were in line, a tad better than we had coming in really since the pandemic began. I think overall, our software revenue is about 80% recurring, and that's the maintenance and the subscription piece, which continues to grow. Our retention rates continue to be very, very high. So it all bodes well for next year when the services and the perpetual stuff should start to come back.
Steve Tusa: So I guess, shouldn't that be dilutive to margins for you guys? Is it, aren't licensed higher-margin than the recurring side?
Neil Hunn: Yes. I mean, the perpetual….. 
Rob Crisci : Not services. 
Neil Hunn : Yes, perpetual licenses or high-margin services is the lowest margin part of a software business and recurring revenue was quite high, as you know. Also, these -- not just us, pretty much every business on the planet, their cost structure is lower this year because of the COVID -- you just couldn't spend money on travel and customer meetings and things like that. So that became a natural offset to some of the perpetual headwinds.
Operator: Our next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jeff Hou: This is Jeff Hou on for Julian. Maybe just asking on, you guys mentioned the short-cycle business is seeing a bit of recovery here. Any -- is there any color you can give on sort of how the cadence of that has looked? Was there some pent-up demand earlier in the quarter? Or are we still seeing kind of more gradual sequential improvement that should continue ahead? 
Neil Hunn: Yes. I appreciate the question. It's such a small part of our business, we reported and talked about last quarter is the consumable piece was starting to pick up. That continued -- the strength of that continued through the quarter. We saw some pickup of the capital spending, particularly at our Struers business. I think the pace throughout the quarter was just improving a little bit sequentially through the quarter. I mean, it was pretty straightforward for us.
Rob Crisci: Yes, very gradual sequential improvement. That's a good way of stating it.
Jeff Hou: Thanks for that. And then Rob, you touched on it earlier, but obviously, we're seeing COVID cases and hospitalization rates kind of going up over the past week or two. How does this kind of line up with the Q4 outlook and sort of the expectations for the medical businesses that are benefiting from COVID, the ones that are sort of -- would benefit from more normalization?
Rob Crisci: Yes. So we've really had 5 businesses this year, right, that have benefited from COVID financially. Verathon, IPA, we talked a lot about in our 3 businesses and our laboratory software platform, and they're all at the frontlines of fighting this thing. And so there would be some give and take, if COVID surged and you had more hospitalizations, which I don't think has happened yet, if that started to happen and those businesses would probably do more and then that could hurt other areas. So it's great of having this big diversified portfolio of businesses. Whereas we'll do great in a post-COVID world, we can't wait for it to happen, but you get a little bit of financial benefit in the short-term. Do you have anything to add to that, Neil?
Neil Hunn: No.
Operator: Our next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Davis : What you -- I'm sure you guys have seen the news with all these new stacks coming out, seems to be literally hundreds of them, but -- or many of them, I should say. Is there any concern that, that's going to provide a new competitor for you guys? Or do you think you're too niche for really that type of a vehicle?
Neil Hunn: Yes. So we spent a little bit of time on this. We've got some -- we studied it with some advisers on this very question, Scott, is that a new competitor emerging for capital deployment. And our conclusion to that is no. And the reason is that a SPAC -- the seller is obviously doing a backdoor IPO. The seller is getting a percentage of their proceeds at closing, not the whole thing. And then you also -- there's other factors around the business dynamic and the leadership team and the ability for it to be a public company that investors have appetite for. And so principally, no. Could there be 1 or 2 on the fringe? Maybe, but it's not like a full-on competitor relative to our capital deployment. And by the way, SPACs have been around in big volume for the last 3 or 4 years, it's obviously increased a bit here. There'll be a lot of the SPAC money that doesn't get deployed or recycled. It's just because you raised, it doesn't mean that the deal is going to happen. And so it's not a totally new phenomenon. It's just catching some, obviously, mainstream media right now.
Scott Davis : Yes. Makes sense. I'm glad you've studied it. But a question about Vertafore. The SaaS versus perpetual, obviously, higher than most of the other software businesses you have. Is there a particular reason why that product sells better into a SaaS versus perpetual? Or is it -- how you go-to-market and how you price it? Is it the product or is it the pricing? I guess is kind of the question. 
Neil Hunn : Well, I think it's that they started the journey to migrating to SaaS earlier than many of our other businesses. So they just got to the point where they have about 80% deployed in SaaS and a little over 90% recurring to their revenue stream. Where, for instance, Deltek is midstream in that conversion, going that way, by the way, I mean Deltek is 75% recurring, pushing to 80% this year, and it'll get -- fast forward 5 years, it'll look more like [Mike Deltek]. And then companies like CBORD, Aderant, PowerPlan are just beginning that migration. Again, all of this paced by our customers. Our customers decide when they're ready to go to the cloud and when the value and when the timing is right for them. And because of that pacing it elongates over multiple years. We don't run sort of any of this Adobe risk where you have the J-curve and go backwards before you go forward. And as we said many, many times, this is all a net growth driver for us as you migrate that, the maintenance part up to the cloud, you get an uplift on that. And then obviously, you're selling net new SaaS licenses which drive your recurring revenue base up. I think it's just that Vertafore started earlier in this process than some of our other companies. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: I just wanted to understand the puts and takes in the guide here. So like -- I think you beat the midpoint of your prior guide by $0.22. You're raising the full year by $0.45. How much of that incremental is from the deals? And how would we think about like the core guidance ex the M&A versus what it was 3 months ago?
Rob Crisci: Yes. So think of the deals is $0.45 to $0.50 to the second half. Some of that we got in Q3, about $0.12 and the rest in Q4. And then everything else is pretty much a wash. There's $0.04 or $0.05 from tax. There's the Verathon and TransCore sort of pushed to the right. And then quite frankly, a lot of investment that we're doing in the fourth quarter with businesses like Verathon, to continue to position ourselves well for next year. So think about the operational stuff as sort of washed in. So when you add the M&A, there’s the midpoint change.
Joe Giordano : Okay. Fair enough. And then just curious on Deltek. What are your guys there saying about like the potential for that business in Biden administration, given the spending plans that they have and things like that?
Neil Hunn : Yes. It's -- often -- it's a frequent question around elections for Deltek that goes back a lot of years, many elections. And what -- the short answer is, either administration, either way is fine for Deltek. The principal reason for that is these government subcontractors just gravitate towards the rapid or fast current government spending. And so for instance, with Obama, it was healthcare; if Biden wins, it’s infrastructure. They will just migrate. And so that where that spending is. There might be a few incremental sort of subcontractors -- government subcontractors that might show up in infrastructure, though it might be a little bit incrementally then special for Deltek but not a meaningful growth driver. The great thing about this business is it does well in almost any government spending environment because as you know government spending always increases.
Operator: Our next question comes from Blake Gendron with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Blake Gendron : So we've been focused on the better-than-expected recovery in non-emergent hospital activity. You mentioned, and you've been very descriptive with the Verathon, IPA impacts of COVID. So wondering if this healthcare recovery is driving somewhat of a subdued non-emergent healthcare exposed businesses versus the Verathon and IPA tailwinds? I'm just wondering how we in aggregate maybe frame the improvement in the non-emergent side of the healthcare business?
Rob Crisci : Yes. So the other medical products businesses that aren't Verathon, right, have been down this year quite a bit. So really double-digits, and that's starting to moderate a little bit in the fourth quarter, whether they're going to be probably more flattish year-over-year. And then they would grow quite a bit coming out of that, right? These are the businesses, as Neil has mentioned, that grow mid-single-digit organically like clockwork literally going back 10 years. And so as you get more procedures happening, then those businesses become -- get back to normal and probably have some catch-up as well.
Neil Hunn : Yes. And just a little more color on that. I mean, hospitals, like a lot of businesses, right, when things got economically really challenged and patient volumes were down quite a bit in Q2 and coming into Q3, hospitals may took dramatic cost actions on the operating side, but also basically froze all capital spending. And hospital budgets as they cycle back in next year, there'll be some level of capital spending, and that's likely going to be on things that are more akin to what we do. I mean, we're like mainstream procedure type things, not esoteric or sort of super high-technology that is super high dollar and sometimes questionable at the hospital level.
Blake Gendron : Understood. And just a follow-up here. So the question was asked last quarter, businesses like that and ConstructConnect getting more sign-on, just given the sheer dynamism in the market. The shorter-cycle industrial recovery broadly seems to be plateauing or stabilizing. How do you expect this to impact new logos in some of these businesses versus the opportunity to expand existing customer touches through things like product enhancement, perhaps R&D maybe is folded in here?
Neil Hunn: Yes. So a couple of things on ConstructConnect. The business has been -- the team there spent really 3 years building the software capability that's part of the workflow of both general contractors and subcontractors and building product manufacturers. It's no longer just a content business, essentially identifying leads for new projects, really working to drive habitualization of the software and the daily workflow of all the users. And so when you get into an environment like the one we're in, the environment opens up, meaning there's more people that are looking for work. So they come to ConstructConnect and buy the first product. The cross-sell into some of the workflow products, now we actually have the ability to do it, and we're seeing decent and better-than-decent attach rates at multiple products. And importantly, then we're seeing what we hope to see, which is the increase of the daily use. And so we think the long-term retention rates will be higher.  We think this is going to continue for quite some time. I mean, ConstructConnect services, sub-10% of the market and there's 90% of the market is unvended. And that market is the one that -- unvended market is the one that is coming to ConstructConnect in an environment like this.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-28 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the second quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. We hope everyone is doing well. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O’Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today’s call. We have prepared slides to accompany today’s call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now, if you’ll please turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release, and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now, please turn to slide three. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenue, our restructuring charge associated with certain businesses in our Process Technologies segment. These were additional structural actions not contemplated in our prior guidance, transaction related expenses for completed acquisitions. And lastly, we have adjusted our cash flow results to exclude income tax payments deferred from Q2 to Q3 due to COVID-19. And now, if you’ll please turn to slide four, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. We hope that everybody listening or reading are doing well and enjoying the summer. With that, let's go ahead and start with their agenda. As usual, we'll start with the enterprise highlights from the quarter, which are quite good given the health and economic challenges associated with the current pandemic. I'll then walk through our key financial and operational levers on a segment basis, and compare how we did versus what we thought heading into the quarter. Rob will then than discuss our P&L, our balance sheet, our cash position. We find ourselves in a very fortunate position to have well over a $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and a completely undrawn $2.5 billion revolver. Following Rob's remarks, I'll walk through our detailed segment review and out Look, followed by our Q3 and full year guidance. And finally, I'll conclude with the highlights for the quarter and discuss our outlook for continued capital deployment. We'll then look forward to your questions. Now let's turn to a brief run through of our Q2 results. Next slide, please. To start, I'm very proud of how Roper performed in the quarter, both on an operating basis and a balance sheet basis. On an operational basis, our revenues declined 2% in the quarter and 3% on organic basis. We saw organic growth in each of our two software segments. In addition, and as we force our last quarter, we saw very strong demand for our medical product businesses and laboratory software mostly used in a global fight against COVID-19. Worth noting and broadly, our businesses did not experience much if any supply chain disruption in the quarter, which contributed to our revenue performance. We also saw gross margins increase 70 basis points to 64.7%. EBITDA margins were impressively flat versus a year ago at 35.3%, and DEPS was strong and came in at $2.94. Most importantly, free cash flow increased 10% to 315 million. Specific to our balance sheet two items of importance, first, we successfully completed a $600 million, 10 year, 2% bond offering in the quarter. Also we're able to deploy $150 million for two bolt-on's indicating the window for capital deployment is reopening. More on these deals as we turn to the segment pages. So while 3% organic revenue declines are certainly below normal. Given the macroeconomic backdrop heading into the quarter, I'm very pleased with this performance, especially as it relates to our margin performance and cash flow. To this end this quarter's performance serves as a great example, to illustrate the intimate knowledge each of our teams have with their business, their customers, their supply chains, and their employees. As we said, for many years, nimble execution yields great results. And that is certainly the case for this quarter and so far, this year. As we'll discuss later, in the call, we're maintaining our full year organic revenue outlook to be plus or minus flat, which we believe is a testament to our decade long business model transformation. In addition, our greater than 1.5 billion cash position, and our undrawn $2.5 billion revolver allows us to be offensive relative to capital deployment. Our M&A pipeline remains full of high-quality opportunities. And prior to turning to the next slide, I want to thank our entire leadership team and our 16,000 employees for your tremendous work this quarter. Thank you. Next slide, please. Turning to the second quarter segment results summary, this page summarizes our key business model levers and how they performed in the quarter. Starting with Application Software, we expected revenues to be down mid-single digits in the quarter, but actually grew 1%. As we did expect, renewal rates remain high and recurring revenues remain strong. Also, we did see strong demand across our laboratory software businesses, as they worked aggressively to enable scores of COVID-19 related testing capability on a global basis. A good guy for the quarter was our software license sales, we saw across the segment better than expected conversion of perpetual ILF sales pipelines. A further positive variance was the success our teams had in implementing our software remotely, which led to higher service utilization rates and revenues. So this segment performed better than expected based on these two factors better license sales and higher service utilization rates. For our network segment we expected to grow low single digits and did coming in at 2%. For the software businesses in this segment just about what we expected, high levels of recurring revenues and renewal rates and decent network expansions at ConstructConnect and DAT. More on this later, but the TransCore New York City congestion pricing infrastructure project continues to push to the right impacting more the second half versus this quarter. As for the MAS segment, we expect it to decline mid-single digits, but did modestly better, only declining 1% in the quarter. Verathon and IPA outperformed our expectations and was driven by exceptional demand for their products and solutions throughout the quarter. As expected, our other medical product businesses were negatively impacted and continue to be negatively impacted by reduced elective hospital procedures. Neptune performed in line with expectations and was down given that it had limited access to meters, especially in Canada and the Northeast United States where meters are installed inside residences. Finally in the segment, we saw sharp declines as expected in our industrial businesses. Turning to our Process Tech segment, we were down 26% in the quarter, versus an expectation of being down plus 30%. The businesses in this segment perform generally as expected, slightly better than we thought at PAC and AMOT. Finally, the better than expected revenues levered very well the EPS, but DEPS coming in at 2.94 versus our guidance range of 2.50 to 2.70. After Rob's comments, I'll come back and discuss in more detail our segment by segment performance. Rob, I'll turn it over to you.
Rob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Roper Technologies as always. So turning to page seven, looking at our Q2 income statement performance, Q2 organic revenue declined 3% versus prior year with total revenue coming in at 1.306 billion. We had positive organic revenue growth in both Application Software and Network Software and Systems, while sharp declines and our smallest segment Process Technologies pulled our overall organic growth into low single digit negative territory for the quarter. Margin performance, as Neil mentioned, was a standout in the quarter as our businesses expanded gross margin by 70 basis points to 64.7% and held EBITDA margins flat at 35.3%. As a result, EBITDA declined only 2% to 461 million. Our tax rate came in at 22.3%, a little higher than last year, resulting in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.94, which was well above our guidance range of 2.50 to 2.70, so in summary, really good execution by our business leaders in a very challenging environment. Next slide, turning to page eight and looking at cash flow, cash flow performance for the quarter was very strong. On a GAAP basis, our operating cash flow was 449 million, which represented a 49% increase over last year. However, for better compatibility and clarity, we are adjusting our results for the 124 million of income tax payments that were deferred from Q2 to Q3 due to COVID-19 and those taxes were subsequently paid in July. So after adjusting for the timing of the 124 million of tax payments that pushed to July, our Q2 operating cash flow grew 8% to 325 million, which represented 25% of revenue. Q2 free cash flow grew 10% to 315 million, which was 24% of revenue. Looking back at the past two years, our Q2 free cash flow has compounded a strong 12%. Congrats and a special thank you to the finance teams at each of our businesses for continuing to make cash flow and cash collections a high priority. It truly was outstanding cash Flow performance in a challenging environment. Next slide, turning to page nine and our asset light business model and negative working capital slide. We exited the first quarter with working capital of minus 4.4% and in Q2 we further improved this metric with working capital as a percent of revenue moving to minus 5.4%. While we're certainly happy as always, to see our income statement hold up well in Q2, we believe it's just as important if not more important, that our cash flow and working capital metrics also remain strong. In fact, as we continue to improve on these important working capital metrics, despite the challenging macro environment, this bodes very well for our ability to compound cash flow at higher levels as the economy does eventually rebound from the pandemic. Next slide, turning to page 10, our strong financial position, so it's really a continuation here of the same story we discussed last quarter. Roper's liquidity position and balance sheet remained very strong. We ended June with over 1.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet. To date in July as mentioned, we have made some tax payments about $316 million of tax payments have been paid to date in July. That's the previously mentioned 124 million of deferred payments as well as 192 million of taxes due on the gain from last year's Gatan sale. So after making these payments, our cash balance today is approximately 1.6 billion and our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility remains fully undrawn. In June, we took advantage of historically favorable conditions in the bond market and issued 600 million of 10-year notes at a coupon of 2.0%. At the time, we tied the record for the lowest coupon ever issued by a Triple B issuer. Really great execution by our team and nice to once again see very strong demand for Roper bonds driven by our consistent ability to generate cash flow, high levels of recurring revenue and our diversified portfolio of asset light businesses. At the end of the quarter our net debt to EBITDA stood at 2.1 times. And with our large cash balance and fully undrawn revolver, we remain very well positioned with significant financial capacity to take advantage of our large pipeline of acquisition opportunities. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil.
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Rob. Let's go ahead and turn to our Application Software segment. Revenues here were 398 million up 1% on an organic basis, and EBITDA was 172 million or 43.1% of revenue. To start, our retention rates and other recurring revenues remain strong in the quarter. In addition, we saw better than expected software license sales in the quarter broadly across Deltek, Aderant and PowerPlan. Of note, sales pipeline bill that occurred prior to the quarter converted at a higher than anticipated rate. In addition and discussed earlier, we saw better service utilization rates and revenues than expected. Our laboratory software businesses Sunquest, Data Innovations and Clinisys all grew and performed nicely aided by the global demand to deploy diagnostic testing software interfaces and laboratory software associated with combating COVID-19. Specific to Sunquest, we received the termination fee payment for the Queensland project in the quarter. As a reminder, last quarter, we noted that the customer opted to terminate this implementation in the face of COVID-19 related challenges. CBORD, which is our software business that sells nutrition and food management software, as well as campus access solutions to hospitals and universities did decline, given their very limited access to both hospital and university clients. Broadly across this segment and of note, we are absolutely seeing an increased desire from our customers to migrate to our cloud or SaaS offerings, one of several trends that COVID appears to be accelerating. This should be a long-term growth driver for our business, as we have a large installed base of customers who will over time migrate to the cloud. And turning to the outlook for the segment, we expect to be roughly flat on organic basis for the second half of the year, with the third quarter facing a challenging prior your comp specific to perpetual license revenues. We continue to expect high levels of recurring revenue retention. As a reminder, the vast majority of our customers in this segment are enterprise or larger companies. Furthermore, we serve a diversified and durable set of end markets, most notably government contractors, marketing services firms, law firms, utilities and hospitals. That said we do anticipate some continued pressure on our new logo software license sales. This quarter's license revenues were aided by sales pipelines that were built pre-COVID and converted better than expected in the quarter. The second half funnel is increasingly comprised of post-COVID shut down activity. As a result, we expect our prospects decision timeframes may extend longer than our historical experience. That said we are encouraged by the fact that the top of the funnel activity looks good, and we liked the MQL, SQL conversion rates. But again expect decision timing could be more elongated than normal. With that next slide, please. Turning to our Network segment, revenues grew 2% organically to 423 million and EBITDA was 176 million or 41.5% of revenue. As a reminder, most of our software businesses in this segment share highly recurring SaaS revenue models, which are further aided by strong network effects that drive higher retention rates and network ads, which were certainly the case in this quarter. To this end, our ConstructConnect network expanded in the quarter and was driven by strong customer ads and network utilization. As a reminder, our ConstructConnect business's primary product provides building contractors with all available commercial building projects that are in the planning phase and enables them to bid and win work. In an economic environment like this one, the value of this product further increases. Our DAT business grew high single digits in the quarter led by large number of carrier additions to the network and strong growth in our rate data offering. To add to our rate data product capabilities, we acquired FMIC in the quarter. FMIC is the leading benchmarking and rate analysis firm focused on the contract freight market. When combined with DAT the FMIC data sets will be a unique product offering that benchmarks both the contract and spot truck freight markets in the US. In addition to FMIC, we also acquired Team TSI. We're integrating team TSI with our SHP business. When complete, the combined business will have a comprehensive operating, financial and quality benchmarks that span the continuum of post-acute care, namely skilled nursing and home health. In addition to helping the post-acute providers operate their businesses more efficiently, SHP will help improve patient outcomes through innovative real time data and evidence-based collaboration among acute care providers and their post-acute partners. We're excited to see this strategy unfold. As mentioned earlier, these bolt-on acquisitions have a combined purchase price of 150 million. Turning to last year's acquisitions and it's worth noting that Foundry and iPipeline continue to perform well and are proving to have quite resilient business models as we expect. As we look to our rf IDEAS and Inovonics businesses, they were challenged in the quarter directly resulting from having limited access to customers. And finally, the TransCore New York City congestion pricing infrastructure projects continues and is deemed essential. However, the project at the election of our customer has slowed and continues to push into 2021. Execution of the project remains strong, but the time is elongating. Turning to the outlook for the segment, we see mid-single digit organic growth in the second half. Relative to Transport and the New York project as mentioned, we see this project pushing to the right, notably about $0.20 of DEPS is being pushed into next year as compared to what we thought a quarter ago. That said, we continue to see growth and resiliency in our Network Software businesses driven by higher recurring revenues, strong retention rates, expanding networks and solid network participation. Next slide please. Turning to our Measurement and Analytical segment, revenues declined 1% organically to 364 million and EBITDA was 132 million or 36.2% of revenue. In the current environment this segments activities are best broken into four boxes, one, Verathon and IPA; two, other medical product businesses; three, Neptune and four, our industrial businesses. First, Verathon and IPA, both experiencing tremendous demand for their products directly attributable to hospital demand resulting from COVID-19. Verathon experienced strong demand for their GlideScope video intubation products. As a result of COVID-19 the percentage of all intubations not just COVID related that are being done using video assistance has meaningfully increased. Verathon's demand is both for capital systems, which means an expanding customer base and the pull through consumables. We have to give hearty congratulations to Earl, Tracy, Tim, Jeff and the entire team at Verathon. It's one thing to have unprecedented demand. It's a completely different thing to be able to flex the supply chain to fulfill the demand within a single quarter. Congrats and thanks to the Verathon team. A similar story with IPA, hospitals rapidly adopted their automated scrub distribution systems to help deploy scrubs more broadly to staff within the hospital setting. Second, and relative to our other medical product businesses, we did see revenue headwinds tied directly to government mandated lower patient volumes within acute care hospitals on a global basis. We also want to note that this group of companies consistently grows mid-single digits, but this growth is conditioned on regular hospital admissions patterns. Third, Neptune was negatively impacted by restricted access to indoor meters in particular in Canada, in the Northeast United States. And finally, and as expected, we did experience a sharp decline in our short cycle industrial businesses. However, in the second half of the quarter, we did see modest improvements in consumable demand. As we turn to the second half outlook, we expect to see mid-single digit growth in this segment led by continued strong demand at Verathon for the reasons just discussed. In addition, we expect to see reduced levels of non-emergent capital procedures providing continued headwinds for a non-Verathon and non-IPA medical product businesses. We do expect to see improvements in Neptune on easing lockdowns, especially in the Northeast United States, which will provide better access to indoor meters. Also, we're cautiously optimistic given that July municipal budgets appear to be largely intact. And finally, we expect to see gradual improvements in our short cycle industrial end markets. Next slide, please. Turning to our Process Technologies segment, revenues were 121 million in the quarter, down 26% on organic basis and EBITDA was 33 million or 27.4% of revenue. This was certainly a difficult quarter for these businesses and we expect the outlook to remain poor for the balance of 2020. Despite a uniquely challenging environment for these businesses, they still had high 20% EBITDA margins in the quarter. And our leadership teams have done a great job of navigating these end markets and continuing to make no regrets investments. We saw our upstream businesses decline approximately 40% in the quarter. Our PAC business also declined, and it was related to weak fuel demand in the quarter. As a reminder PAC is our laboratory fuel analysis business. Also, CCC was weak based on the inability to perform field service work, all related to COVID-19. One bright spot in the quarter was Zetec, which experienced growth based on the strength of their new non-destructive testing products. Also in the quarter, we initiated targeted restructuring actions across a few of our businesses in this segment, which resulted in a $13.6 million charge. None of these structural changes were considered in our guidance from a quarter ago. These actions will position these businesses to better serve its customers and realize longer term savings. While the oil and gas markets and customer commitments remain more muted, we believe this is the right time to execute these restructuring activities. The outlook for the balance of the year continues to be an extremely challenging one, as we expect to see approximately 25% organic decline for the second half. Specifically, we do not anticipate any recovery in upstream oil and gas markets and expect upstream to account for less than 40 million of revenues in the second half. In addition, we expect to continue to have limited customer access, which hampers our ability to perform field service work. Next slide please. As we turn to our guidance, we're narrowing and modestly raising the midpoint of our full year adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of 11.90 and 12.40 per share. We continue to guide full year organic revenues to be plus or minus flat. In addition, we're initiating DEPS guidance for 3Q in the range of 2.90 to $3. Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. Next slide please. Given the global pandemic and associated shutdowns in the quarter, we're pleased with our performance, with revenue only being down 3% organically, EBITDA margins holding flat versus the prior year at 35.3% and cash flow growing 10% to 315 million. From an operating point of view, our businesses remain focused on employee health and safety continue to improve the efficiency of remote work, to remain super intimate with our customers and continue to focus on long-term durable growth. To this end, our businesses continue invest in growth oriented operating initiatives. Our leaders, all of whom are long-term builders are masterful at maintaining product investments during down cycles, which oftentimes lead to market share gains upon recovery. As a leadership team, we remain steadfastly committed to this concept. For the full year, we expect to have plus or minus flat organic revenue growth. We believe our portfolio of businesses and our governance processes continue to be well suited to navigate these difficult times. Our balance sheet is stronger than at any point in history with over $1.5 billion of cash and $2.5 billion of revolver capacity. And specific to capital deployment, we do have a high quality and active pipeline of opportunities as private equity sellers have recently re-entered the market. That said and as always, our CRI based strategy focus is on long-term cash flow compounding, and we will continue to patiently evaluate and pursue capital deployment opportunities that are consistent with this strategy. And as we turn to your questions, I remind everybody that what we do is very simple. We compound cash flow by operating our portfolio of businesses that have leading positions and niche markets that have the proven ability to generate increasing cash flow as their businesses expand. We provide our business leaders with Socratic coaching about what great looks like relative to driving long-term CRI accretive organic growth, with particular emphasis focused on strategy, operations, innovation and talent development. Our business leaders understand that success in our culture is based on their ability to compete and win for talent and to compete and win for customers that in turn allow us to compete and win for shareholders. To this end, we incent our management teams based on growth. And based on these factors and perhaps most importantly, we have a culture that is rooted in the principles of mutual respect, trust and transparency. And finally, we take the excess free cash flow that is generated by our businesses and deploy to buy businesses that have better cash returns on our existing company that in turn helps accelerate our cash flow compounding. It is these simple ideas that deliver powerful results. And with that, now let's turn to your question.
Operator: We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Deane.
Rob Crisci: Hey, Deane.
Deane Dray: Can we start with the congestion tolling project? Can you just give us some context of this latest push out? It would be fair to assume that just logistically COVID is presenting issues in terms of being able to work on the project. But is there been any change in scope that's being considered?
Neil Hunn: No. Hey, Deane. No change whatsoever in the scope, the contract value that we talked about a few quarters ago remains the exact same. And so the only thing that is happening here is the project is pushing a bit to the right into 2021 for the reason you said, a little bit access to personnel related to COVID and a little bit just at the election of the customer line to paste the project a little bit. And I think also we highlighted last quarter, I mean, the motivation of the client is never been higher. I think it was just around this time last quarter. The proceeds from the project for 2021 and '22 could be used in MTAs operating budget where the initial project that was going to be used for capital only, so there is a clear motivation to get the – by the customer to get the project up and running. It's just slipping to the right a little bit.
Deane Dray: Just to clarify, there was a discussion of push outs in the first quarter. So this $0.20 of EPS push out. This is new and incremental, correct?
Neil Hunn: That's correct.
Rob Crisci: Yeah, that's – yeah, that's correct Deane. So the project was originally around 200 million for this year, and now we've got about 110 or so million in for 2020. And as Neil mentioned, the rest is pushed to the right, and we expect to be completed in '21.
Deane Dray: Got it and then second topic would be the net COVID impact across your businesses. And I'm sure this is a fair question to ask. But you listed a number of ways that Roper is positioned to help between the labs support system witnesses [ph], data innovations, the Verathon incubation systems, those would be the positives, but the negative is it all related to just the deferrals of non-emergency procedures. So how do those to net out if?
Neil Hunn: If your question is relegated to the medical product businesses versus price, if you relegate to that as a broader to Roper, I want to make sure I'm answering the question –
Deane Dray: No, just the medical related, sorry.
Neil Hunn: Okay. Yeah. So it's a net – a meaningful net grower, right, when you look at the benefit of those of Verathon and IPA good guy against the bad guys of the other four or five medical product businesses aggregated together, it's a very meaningful positive, good guy. It's worth noting though, the Verathon demand while it certainly surged in the quarter, the team worked really well to work down the backlog a little bit more to go in the second half of the year. The team that Verathon believes that the demand is – will endure a bit right. It's about the number, the percentage or the market share of global incubations that are being done with video assistance versus not. Going into the pandemic, it was somewhere in the 15% of all intubations were done with video assistance and 85 direct. And that market share video is going – it's meaningfully higher now and it will stay. It'll be meaningfully above 15% on the backside of this, so the market just grew, we believe, for these products that Verathon has.
Deane Dray: That's real helpful. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Davis: Hi, good morning, guys.
Neil Hunn: Hey, Scott, good morning.
Rob Crisci: Hey, Scott.
Scott Davis: I was trying to get a sense and a little bit of follow up on Deane's question, but trying to get a sense of ConstructConnect. You commented out the pandemic, perhaps helped – is helping catalyze some growth there. I mean, very few of us are experts in many of these businesses. I'm certainly not an expert in ConstructConnect by any stretch of imagination. But can you give us a sense of how that business grows in this type of environment? Is it – well, I'll just leave a little bit of that just open ended, how does it grow and how much does it impact? Is there any way to – the magnitude, the pandemic really helping get word of mouth or otherwise out there on the product.
Neil Hunn: Yeah, happy to talk through that, so just to remind you and everyone ConstructConnect, the primary part of the business all for non-residential or commercial construction in the United States and Canada that's in the planning phase. So once a shovel goes in the ground, other constituents in the value chain pick up that. This is about planning. It allows general contractors, subcontractors, building product manufacturers to be aware of the projects are being planned, so they can bid for and win those projects and we have software that organizes all of that activity. So when the market is raging hot, right, all the subcontractors have more work and they can possibly do the value of leads or what new projects is lower, right. And so we've always sort of said, if there's five market conditions, five is white hot and one is there's basically zero construction, that constructing that value proposition is best in positions two, three and four, right, where there's work and activity going on, but not so much work that contractors have so much to do, right. And so, what's essentially happened here and ConstructConnect reports on this and Zach can give it to you is, nonres construction activity is down 28% versus prior year. It was up a little bit in June versus May. But that's the exact environment where the value proposition of leads and project awareness sort of thrives. And that's why you saw more contractors come into the ConstructConnect market and grow in the quarter.
Rob Crisci: I would just add to that it's a SaaS business, Scott. So there's not huge swings in the revenue like you get with a perpetual license bid. We're seeing increased activity in the network and that leads to a little bit of more subscriptions, more customers, and then over time, that drives additional growth with the business.
Scott Davis: Right and those custom customers, I mean, do they come in and then they generally stick around or they come out when economic conditions get weaker?
Neil Hunn: Really appreciate the question. So history, if you go way back in the ark of ConstructConnect, some of them will stay and some of them will leave. But since our ownership in '16, the ConstructConnect team has worked really hard to build habituation into the product, if you will. So now there's integrated takeoff which is the estimation process and directly linked and so we believe the customers when we look at the utilization of the product, they're in the product on a multi time a day basis now, where five, six, seven years ago, they'd be in the product only when they needed to look for any project. And so we believe based on that the sort of the long-term retention rates of the business go up.
Scott Davis: Okay. Okay, super helpful. Okay. Congrats guys. Good luck this quarter.
Neil Hunn: Yeah. Congrats on the book as well.
Scott Davis: Thank you.
Operator: [indiscernible] Please go ahead, sir with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, can you hear me okay?
Neil Hunn: We can Steve. Hey, I think its Steve, right? Yeah, okay.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Sorry. Sorry guys, just managing some things here. Like eight different calls. Just on the acquisitions you recently did. Can you just give us some color on the revenues and what you paid for those, just general multiples for some of the ones you've done?
Rob Crisci: Yeah. Sure, Steve. So there's the two acquisitions in the quarter, combined purchase price about 150 million. And we've got about 25 million or so revenue in the model for '21. And EBITDA margins there in the mid to high 40s. So pretty good cash, but each business is being integrated into a business. So there was not a lot added for the second half, but there's some integration going on, but that built a real good strategic adds to the Roper businesses.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it and then just a last one on the – on some of the – I think you guys had expected a bit weaker performance in some of the software businesses. I know you went through some of this in the prepared remarks. But is there anything that kind of gives back a little bit in the second half that notable and it's material in any of those software businesses that just perhaps some differed downside relative to what you would have expected in the second quarter, some timing items?
Neil Hunn: So in the second quarter, I mean, yeah, I think the second quarter software for the reasons we said on Application Software, I mean, it was the better utilization rates on the service side. And we expected more deferral or push outs of the license activity. And that proved to be a little conservative. And so that was broad that license activity was brought across Deltek, Aderant, PowerPlan. We saw good performance across the diagnostic businesses that we just talked about. Excuse me, some of that – a lot of that was COVID related.
Rob Crisci: Right, yeah, there's a lot of good – good things that happened in acute care software in the quarter which are driven by the demand around COVID. Right, so that's – some of that stuff happened in the second quarter that we didn't expect. And we'll see what continues into the second half, but that's difficult to predict.
Operator: Steve, was there a follow up?
Neil Hunn: Sounds like he went on, okay.
Operator: Understood, the next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, everyone. This is Jeff Alvaro [ph] on for Julian.
Neil Hunn: Okay Jeff.
Unidentified Analyst: Maybe just to start Application Software margins came in pretty strong for the quarter, can you just give some color on what contributed there? And maybe as part of that, just your thoughts on how margins look there in – at other segments for the second half?
Neil Hunn: I'll take the first part of that. Let Rob take a second. Hey, it's directly – the Application Software margin performance in the quarter is directly tied to better license activity as you know, perpetual licenses in quarter are super high margin, 90 plus percent, 85%, 90%, so when they perform an expectation on license, and you tend to have better margin performance.
Rob Crisci: And then we also received the Queensland payment for Sunquest, which put revenue and large high margin net revenue in the second quarter as well, which helped. And then as we look at the second half the margins don't move around a lot in the other segments, which is a great thing, right. It's high recurring revenue, very stable business models you don't get this sort of swaying, so we certainly expect EBITDA margins to be sort of flat or a little bit better year-over-year in the software segment.
Unidentified Analyst: Perfect. And then some interesting comments you guys mentioned, municipal budgets seemed to be intact so far. Any thoughts on how much this holds in the second half? And then maybe thoughts on what level of potential cuts you guys are dialing in for kind of your outlook next year? I know that's a bit early. And then maybe just as part of that, can you just remind us kind of what percentage of sales within M&A as it's kind of tied to municipal budgets?
Rob Crisci: Very low dollars percent of revenue, I mean, it's going to be the part of Neptune that swings around with budgets. And Neptune's a pretty stable high recurring revenue business. So it's a real small percentage of the segment in single digits, it's going to really be driven by swinging budgets.
Neil Hunn: Yeah, and more broadly coming – this time last quarter in the height of the shutdown, a risk item that we – or were flagged was our Neptune's customers budgets going to be intact as they rolled into their New Year's because a large percentage of these customers have a July 1 fiscal year just given the broader economic challenges that municipalities and cities are experiencing. The good news is the budgets appear to be largely intact, so that high – the first risk item appears to be mostly retired. Remaining risk item is now the spend against the budget, right and that's to be determined, but the first step is a checkmark and we'll see how things unfold the rest of the year.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it, thank you guys.
Neil Hunn: Yeah, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Ritchie of golden. Please go ahead.
Joe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Hey, good morning.
Rob Crisci: Hey, Joe.
Joe Ritchie: Hey, Neil, maybe just some commentary on the elective procedure impact in the quarter and obviously, like things are still incredibly fluid with the virus, but I'm just trying to understand, maybe how much of this pushes out into 2021 and whether there's like a revenue boost in 2021 once hopefully, elective procedures come back.
Neil Hunn: Yeah. So the products – the companies that we have that are somewhat indexed to procedure volume, its one derivative behind it, right. So very little of our businesses are consumable in a procedure, but our capital and products are used by other companies who are – and used in a procedure. And so we're buffered a little bit by what our customers are seeing. We did see a little bit in the second, maybe the June time period, some of the true consumables sort of pick back up. And that's just going to be evolved for the balance of the year. We would expect, as I mentioned, the open continent the prepared remarks, I mean, this group of businesses going back for many, many years grows like clockwork at mid-single digits, and that assumes a patient volume yet that are normalized and so to the extent volumes are normal in 2021, then we would see a pickup in that group of businesses.
Rob Crisci: Just to give you a sense Joe, so the sort of other medical products businesses which exclude Verathon and IPA, which have a huge COVID benefit, so everything else, those businesses were down double digits in the quarter, and they would normally be mid-single growers. And so I think we will catch up some of that at some point, but it's very difficult to predict when.
Joe Ritchie: Got it, that's helpful, Rob and then just maybe my quick follow up. I thought your commentary around like the acceleration into cloud-based solutions was interesting. I guess, Neil, if you could maybe just provide some context for what that opportunity could be for you guys, either qualitative or quantitative that would be helpful.
Neil Hunn: Yeah, I'll leave it. It's sort of on the qualitative basis, right. So as we said for a long time, we – as a guiding principle, we allow our customers to pace the transition to the cloud, we don't force it or have a force product migration or just they're waiting for that to occur. We have some businesses like Strata that are born in the cloud. We have other businesses like Aderant and PowerPlan that are still vast, vast majority on-premise. And then we have companies like Deltek that are somewhere in between, right, sort of in the middle in their journey of the migration. What we've seen at Deltek is that that migration is a net growth driver. And we can talk about that in more detail later to the extent you're interested. But you basically are taking a large installed base of customers who pay you annual maintenance and you're uplifting them to the cloud. So you're providing all the backbone and IT sort of management services, but also, you're doing all the release management, getting them on the most recent release. They're more micro releases. And so the customers get to take advantage of what you're actually developing. And that has real value associated within the mind's eye of the customers. And so for that reason, as they migrate from on-premise to cloud, there's an uplift in recurring, a pretty meaningful one and that's a that's a multiyear growth driver for our enterprise on Application Software or an Application Software.
Joe Ritchie: Got it, that's super helpful. Thanks, guys.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Hey, guys good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Joe Giordano: Can you talk about maybe some of the implications of a potential infrastructure bill that might have maybe on, I'm guessing Deltek would be the most maybe PowerPlan, I'm not sure? But how that might impact the overall portfolio?
Neil Hunn: It's not – I think it would have a slight impact. And the reason I say that I'm looking at Rob and Shannon, it's not something we talked about right. And so about an infrastructure bill, we're not rooting for one so I think we're –
Rob Crisci: Yeah, I think the government contractors are always betting money on whatever there is to spend money on.
Neil Hunn: Yeah, Rob's point there is a very good one, right, so the contractors go where the fast flow is in a government spend. And so maybe you get a few more government contractors that could be dealt like customers, but that's not over yet [ph].
Joe Giordano: Okay, fair enough. Can you kind of just set a range kind of for us, I's assume like within – your software businesses did better than expected, obviously, but I'm guessing there's huge differences between businesses like CBORD where you couldn't go? Like people were on site like, can you kind of scale what are the – even if you don't want to get into the specific business names or like how big were some of the biggest declines and how big were some of the biggest gainers in the in flight?
Neil Hunn: Well, I'll set it up. I'll give you some context and let Rob sort of give you his view. So as we mentioned, last quarter in this segment, about 70% of revenues are recurring, 20% are tied to services and that's generally coming – working off some sort of six to 18 month backlog and then 10% of the revenue is that perpetual license. So the most short-term impacted is that 10%, so that tends to mute the magnitude of the swing in any given period of time, assuming that the in flight implementation projects don't stall. We see a lot of that block, if any of that activity in the quarter. So with that Rob?
Rob Crisci: Yeah, they are just very stable businesses. So I'm just looking through all the software businesses and sort of they're all kind of between a low single digit gain or low single digit decline, with the exception of CBORD, which is a little bit worse than that. So again, that a little bit better than expected because you know a huge part of the businesses are stable. The question is are you going to get any of these license wins in the quarter? Are you able to look to deliver services? And we were. And so to the extent that continues, that certainly helps us, there's just aren't big swings in these businesses, which of course, we had huge swings in the product businesses where there's more issues with not being able to access customers, et cetera.
Joe Giordano: Better, thanks, guys.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Blanton of Clear Harbor Asset Management. Please go ahead.
Alex Blanton: Hi, good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Alex.
Alex Blanton: I wanted to ask about the push up in the TransCore business in New York City. You mentioned $0.20 going into 2021 from '20, a new $0.20. And then I think you said I want to confirm this, a 110 million now in this year versus 200 million before. So that's a $90 million push, is that – are those the right numbers?
Rob Crisci: They are Alex. So there was an interim step in there that last quarter with the 200 became 175. And now it's 110, so the move from 175 to 110 is your $0.20.
Alex Blanton: Okay, that's what I wanted to know. So that's a $65 million push out, generated $0.20 per share, push out, so we can calculate the incremental margin there. That's what I'm getting at.
Neil Hunn: These are all rough numbers, but yeah, go ahead.
Alex Blanton: Yeah, I know. Yeah. We don't need percentage. The second thing is, we haven't really – I don't think anyone asked about the acquisition pipeline. You've got max $4.1 billion of spending power for acquisitions. What does that look like? What are you working on, big, small, what's the timing? Is some of that getting pushed out because of COVID? What's the situation there?
Neil Hunn: Alex, appreciate the question. So I'll give you a little bit of context and color. So we had a pretty – the activity coming into COVID. I mean, it was as busy as we had been that I can recall since being here in 2011 in terms of what the funnel activity looked like. Obviously, everything shut down. I mean, when the credit markets shut down, everything shut down in April and May. It was there was really no activity anywhere. No sellers were selling anything for obvious reasons. But the end of May, first part of June we saw some green shoots, we obviously got these two bolt-on's complete, which are sort of in the pipeline pre-COVID. And really here since the middle of June, until now, it's almost as if we're back to January, February in terms of private equity seller interest in activity. The private credit markets aren't fully back, but they're back enough to give sponsors confident that they can run a process or processes. And so we're encouraged by all that because we're sitting here with what you just said a large amount of cash and borrowing capacity to sort of continue this – our long-term CRI driven sort of compounding strategy. I will note the things that we see that – obviously, the things that come out of the shoot first after a slowdown are the very best assets, right, the ones that have the best niches, the best competitive position, the best highest level of recurring revenue, durability, things like that. And those tend to be fairly valued, right. There's not a lot of bargains that we would say we see in the software space, but values – valuations consistent with what we saw coming into the pandemic.
Alex Blanton: What accounts for the pickup? The COVID situation is actually worse than was in April. There's spikes all over the place and the government doesn't have control over at all. They're not even trying. So what accounts for the opening up of acquisition activity?
Neil Hunn: We can only speculate what's in the mind's eye of the sellers, right, but a couple of things. First is, the types of – everything I just said I should have qualified by saying our M&A pipeline is 100% software focused, right and so these are businesses even in the public markets that are proving to be resilient, sort of the comparables if you will and so that is – colors my comments on what a funnel activity looks like. The other thing is private equity sellers, which is where we buy 100% of our assets from have to return capital. They have limited sort of pressures. That's a constant drumbeat. And then finally, and this is me certainly speculating about private equities view of what might happen in election and taxes, but that certainly may be a motivating factor to get some things done by the end of this year.
Alex Blanton: Taxes, okay. Yeah. I don't remember the question, but now it slipped my mind.
Neil Hunn: Happens to me all the time.
Alex Blanton: Yeah. You said 100% software focused. I know what it was. Your sister company Dover Corp used to say that – one of the favorite things they said was that during recessions, they always gained market share because they had the dominant positions in their companies and their markets. And so weaker competitors would lose out some business and even go out of business during recessions. So Dover actually benefited from market share standpoint during economic downturns. How would you characterize Roper in that regard? And what is happening now, are you gaining share overall from people having a lot worse time than you are?
Neil Hunn: So we would echo those comments that companies like Roper in our history is we continue to invest in product through cycle, especially in the down cycle because your competitors oftentimes are not able to. We also stay super close to our customers, the vast majority of what we – our companies have direct channel access or a sap to work through a distributor so you stay super close to the customers and almost certainly on the back end, you can gain share either because of customer intimacy or because you develop or launch some new product or product capability, so 100% that is the case for Roper in this current environment.
Alex Blanton: Okay. And this is a tough one, but what percentage of this 4.1 billion do you think you might deploy this year?
Rob Crisci: That's real hard. Yeah, that's really impossible to predict. We're going to do the work we always do and we certainly have the capacity, but we only do the best deals and we never feel pressured. But certainly the balance sheet has never been stronger. So we feel good about our ability to deploy capital this year.
Neil Hunn: As our – my predecessors said many years ago, our discipline is only outmatched by our patience.
Alex Blanton: Okay, thank you very much.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Rob Crisci: Thanks.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for any closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-28 08:00:00) =====
Operator: The Roper Technologies First Quarter 2020 financial results conference call will now begin. I will now turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the first quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. We hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O’Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today’s call. We have prepared slides to accompany today’s call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now, if you’ll please turn to slide two, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During today’s call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A description can be found on this page, in our press release, and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today’s call in the context of that information. And now, please turn to slide three. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter and year primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenue. And now, if you’ll please turn to slide four, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks Zack and good morning everyone. First, and most importantly, we hope that everyone that is joining us this morning and your families are staying safe and our in good health. With that in mind, our first quarter was quite good, 4% organic revenue growth, expanding gross and EBITDA margins, and very strong cash flow coming in at 13% above last year. After a brief run through of Q1 results, I'll turn the call to Rob and he will discuss our P&L, our balance sheet, and our cash position. We find ourselves in a very fortunate position to have $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet and a completely undrawn $2.5 billion revolver. Then, I'll turn to discuss our operational status and respond to the COVID-19 situation. To this end, all of our product businesses are deemed essential, and all our non-production workforce are being productive working remotely from home. As we turn to our segment discussion, the majority of our comments will focus on a detailed view of how our businesses and business models should perform through the current situation. The impacts we're seeing across our diverse set of businesses range from a pause and new license sales for some of our high recurring revenue software business to a positive spike in demand for Verizon's critical medical products to sharp declines in our Industrial and Process Technologies businesses.  Following this, we will break down our Q2 and full year organic revenue guidance. In the midst of this global economic shutdown, we are guiding our full year organic revenues be plus or minus flat. This is a remarkable testament to the durability of our business model. During the discussion of our guidance, we outlined to you the assumptions that would cause our earnings to be on the low or high end of our guidance range. I'll then turn to discuss our outlook for continued capital deployment and end with a summary of a few of the Roper companies that are on the frontlines responding to the COVID-19 virus. Finally, we'll turn to your questions. Now, let's turn to a brief run through our Q1 results. Next slide please. Q1 was quite good for us. Our businesses continue to work hard to execute strategy and town offenses. And Q1 is another good data point that what we're doing is taking hold. revenue grew 4% organically, with solid organic growth in three of our four segments. Gross margins and EBITDA margins expanded nicely and debt came in at $3.05, a $0.05 above our guidance range. And as we said for nearly 20 years, cash is the best performance measure with free cash flow being up 13% in the quarter to $353 million, which was 26% of revenue and 76% of EBITDA. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rob to discuss or detail financial performance.
Rob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. It's really great to have the opportunity to connect with all of you today. Turning to page six, Q1 income statement metrics. As Neil mentioned, organic growth was a very solid 4%, which was better than we had expected coming into the quarter. We did have positive organic growth in three of the four segment, led by Network Software & Systems at plus 9% and Application Software at plus 5%. Once again, really strong margin execution by our business leaders in the quarter, driving strong operating leverage while continuing to invest for future growth, gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 63.5%. EBITDA margin also expanded 50 basis points to a record 34.5%, driving very solid 7% EBITDA growth for the quarter. Earnings before taxes increased 7% to $408 million. As a reminder, last year, we had a $43 million discrete tax item in Q1, resulting in a $0.41 benefit, which drove our tax rate last year below 10%. This year our Q1 tax rate was a more normal 21%, which resulted in debt of $3.05, which was well above our guidance range, as Neil mentioned. So in summary, a really strong operational quarter for Roper and really great execution by our business leaders. Next slide. Turning to cash flow, Q1 operating cash flow 364 million was a 10% increase versus prior year, Q1 free cash flows was $353 million, a 13% increase versus prior year. So, looking over the past few years, our Q1 free cash flows compound at a very strong 14%. As Roper -- at Roper, as Neil said, and as you've all said, as you know, hundreds of times over the past few decades, we really do believe cash is the best measure performance and those are really another great cash flow. We've consistently compared our EBITDA to free cash flow at a rate well above 70% over the past several years, as you can see 76% conversion in Q1 and we certainly expect to have strong cash conversion to continue moving forward. Next slide. So turn to page eight. The asset light business model, once again we exited the quarter with negative net working capital, negative 4.4%. That was aided by consistently strong working capital management across the enterprise and increasing deferred revenue across our portfolio of niche market leading software businesses. Brokers focus on cash flow and working capital will be especially important as we work our way through the pandemic. While we certainly could see some negative short term impact from delayed payments in some affected end markets such as acute healthcare, we are well positioned overall given the durable and markets we serve. Our large deferred revenue balance gives us a very high recurring revenue base, limiting earnings volatility. On a cash basis, spread across the independent businesses and rather evenly throughout the calendar year, limiting any impact of attrition on our cash conversion. So in closing, we expect our working capital to remain negative and our strong cash conversion to continue in 2020 and beyond. Next slide. So turning to the balance sheet and the strong financial position, this is always a very important slide, but even more critical in today's economic environment, dealing with really the unprecedented shock to global economic activity around the pandemic. We will first look at the numbers here and then I'll spend a little time on the following slide to talk more about our outlook, and the steps we've taken at Roper to prepare ourselves to continue to execute on our discipline capital deployment strategy. In short, Ropers liquidity position and balance sheet are very strong. We currently have over $1 billion of cash on hand and our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility remains fully undrawn As a reminder, we divested our Gatan -- we do have approximately $200 million of cash taxes yet to be paid on the Gatan divestiture and that payment is now not due until July with a postponement of tax day. So in summary at the end of the quarter, gross debt set at $5.3 billion against nearly $2 billion of trailing EBITDA for a gross debt to EBIT a ratio of 2.7 times. However, taking into account our unusually large cash balance, net debt was only $4.3 billion. Next slide. So turning to page 10, I wanted to take a moment really during the unprecedented time and review we think -- what we think are the many benefits of brokerage in the business model. The diversification we have across 45 independent, high margin asset light businesses operating across many different niches resulted in excellent credit profile. We are not dependent on specific end markets and almost nothing is centralized, limiting the overall financial impact of any facility closures or industry, specific economic shocks. So aided by our business model and diversification, we are confident that Roper Enterprise will continue to generate high levels of cash flow in nearly all conceivable macroeconomic scenarios. As mentioned earlier, we have over – balance sheet, which as you all know, is a very unusual – unusually high number for over I think longtime shareholders realize how unusual this is. Typically we hold a limited amount of cash and drawn a revolver to fund acquisitions. This is however fortunate timing given the pandemic and something we want to take advantage of with an eye toward future cash flow compounding. So over the last couple of weeks, we initiated and completed an amendment process with 100% support from our bank group to modify our gross debt to EBITDA covenant to receive credit for this cash. It was fascinating [indiscernible] with the banks. We are one of the only companies that kind of demanded process as a purely offensive move. This process really was an eye opener to just how unique our company is. My thanks to Shannon and also our high quality Bank Group for all the work to complete this amendment quickly and successfully. So under the new calculation, our net debt to EBITDA ratio currently fits at 2.1 times, which is about a half a turn lower than old calculation compared to the continent of 3.5. So in summary, we've remained very well – of our large pipeline of high quality [indiscernible] opportunities. So with that, I'll turn it back over, Neil.
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Rob. It's worth underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and borrowing capacity. Also a great job by Rob and Shannon, and adjusting to a net debt covenant this further strengthens our capital appointment capacity and the ability to play offense at the appropriate time. Also, thanks to our lending group. Now let's turn to how we're responding operationally to COVID-19 sectors. We are blessed to have very few COVID-19 cases, each of which has recovered or is recovering. From an operational readiness perspective we are also fortunate. All of our businesses with manufacturing facilities have engage essential and remain operational delivering the vital products that our customers need during – at successfully transition to working from home. Our portfolio of niche businesses are characterized by having meaningfully reduced cyclical exposure, having high levels of recurring revenues, low asset intensity, low levels of fixed costs and high levels of operating cash flow. We operate this portfolio in a highly decentralized operating structure that enables rapid, nimble execution. Our locally driven, bottoms up approach to business planning performs exceptionally well in any environment and clearly. This is an unprecedented one. Given this, there have not been any top down mandates or mandatory targets, but rather a few guiding principles to consider and an incentive system that promotes investments and long-term organic growth. We did after businesses to assess the short and medium term impact to the demand drivers and take a sober view of each. Based on this, each business deploy appropriate cost countermeasures with emphasis on three items. First, each business work to manage their margins appropriately with always vigilant management of cash flow. Second, each business targeted mostly temporary cost, countermeasures. And third, each business continues to make no regrets investments in innovation and talent, all of which have a mind eye towards an offensive-oriented posture upon recovery. Also important and often under discussed is our direct channel access in the vast majority of our companies. Rarely does Roper have a business that relies on third parties or distributors for market access. Given this, we remain engaged with our customers in good times and bad. We learn, we adapt, most importantly, we stay connected. This typically enables market share capture in difficult times and accelerated benefits during the recovery cycle. And in all times, our leaders keep an intense focus on cash. Having worked through this process over the last several weeks, I'm incredibly proud of how our leaders have reacted and managed through the current situation. And I'd like to thank each and everyone for the work, hard decisions and difficult conversations you have had to endure. Thank you. As we turn to our first quarter segment results, I'll start with our application software segment. Briefly, a quick run-through of Q1, which was quite strong. Revenues were $405 million, up 5% on an organic basis. EBITDA was $156 million or 38.6% of revenue. The quarter was highlighted by continued strength at Deltek for consistent factors: strength in GovCon execution, nice wins at the enterprise level and certain professional service markets and continued cloud or SaaS adoption. However, based on the impact of C19 sheltering, Deltek did see a slowing in perpetual deal activity during the last couple of weeks in the quarter. Power plant was also strong in the quarter. The sales pipeline build that we discussed in prior quarters executed nicely. CBORD and Strata were strong. In CBORD's case, due to their integrated security and subscription-based software sold into higher-ed markets, and for Strata, much of the same, continued solid sales execution and adoption of their hospital-based cost accounting and financial planning solutions. As we turn to outlook considerations, we want to provide an overview of the business model drivers for the businesses in this segment. To start, about 10% of the revenues in this segment are derived from perpetual software licenses. Within this bucket of revenue, new sales are derived principally from three sources: new logos; add-on product sales to existing customers; and finally, seat or volume expansions. Given the current economic outlook, we expect the vast majority of new logo sales to meaningfully slow down for the balance of the year. However, we do expect some volume of add-on product bookings to continue. Typically, during economic slowdowns, some level of selling activity does occur within this bucket of license revenue. These types of projects are smaller dollar and sold and delivered remotely. The next bucket of revenues are tied to service delivery. Service revenues arise from two sources: new product implementations or existing product upgrades. The first bucket is tied directly to new license sales, either new logos or add-ons. The second bucket or services upgrade, run independent of new license activity. The services book of business runs off a six to 12-month backlog. To date, the vast majority of our service projects continue, albeit at a slower pace, given both our customers and our delivery teams are adjusting to working remotely. We expect this revenue stream to be minimally impacted during the course of the year. Finally, the remaining 70% of revenue is tied to recurring maintenance or SaaS-based revenues. Our companies in this segment, service end markets that are expected to perform relatively well versus a broader economy, government contractors, law firms, healthcare and education. Given we mostly serve larger enterprises and less affected end markets, we do expect retention rates to remain high. Now let's turn to the next slide to discuss some specific business impacts. Our application software businesses have proven to be extremely durable and consistent organic growers and will continue to do so once customer access and activities begin to come back online. However, in an environment where we essentially – where essentially all businesses on a global basis are closed, these businesses will be modestly impacted. As we look at Deltek specifically, we expect the government contractor market to continue to perform well. New lead generation and pipeline build have continued during the last few weeks. On the other hand, we do expect a slowdown in new logo bookings and their professional service markets as the companies they serve are in meaningfully impacted segments and tend to be SMB sized. PS revenue and retention should perform well across both GovCon and Professional Service markets. Turning to Aderant, PowerPlan and CBORD, we believe these businesses will be impacted in a similar fashion. We expect some net new logo bookings to slow for the next few quarters as these businesses tend to rely on face-to-face interactions to drive enterprise level new logo sales. These activities will likely be limited for the remainder of 2020. The smaller, add-on type product sales are expected to maintain at some level, albeit at a lower level of sales activity. All three of these businesses have done a fantastic job of shifting their implementation and service activities to be remotely delivered. Recurring revenue retention should perform well. As we look at our four businesses, we sell into the hospital setting, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience limited physical access to hospitals. Also, given the financial duress, most U.S. health systems are facing, we expect hospital capital spending to be meaningfully down in 2020. That said, labs are extremely busy improving their value to the world over right now. Our teams have been busy enabling all the new COVID-19 tests and will continue to do so. As a direct result to COVID-19, the Sunquest project in Queensland has been canceled. Strata should continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace. We expect continued strong demand for Strata solution, which help hospitals identify and manage costs and help model and execute financial plans. Finally, we do anticipate a possible acceleration to the cloud on the back end of the current environment. As customers have had to implement their DR plans, they are likely returning with an increased appetite to offload and remote it management of their core systems. Time will tell. Next slide, please. Turning to our network segment. Q1 revenues grew 9% organically to $441 million. EBITDA was $185 million or 42% of revenue, a solid quarter, indeed. TransCore's work for the congestion pricing infrastructure project continued in the quarter as it has been deemed essential work by the state of New York. Network software was strong and highlighted by iTrade and DAT. iTrade grew high single digits on the back of strong renewal and cross-sell activity. DAT continued to expand our network and successfully completed the market launch of rate forecasting and book-it-now capabilities. Finally, RF Ideas did very well due to their identity management solutions. For this segment, approximately 60% of the revenues are driven by our network software businesses, 85% of which are recurring. These businesses have very strong network effects and generally serve less impacted end markets such as healthcare, life insurance, logistics, food and media and entertainment. Given the core software functionality value and strong network benefits, we expect retention rates to hold up well across these businesses. Relative to TransCore, as mentioned, the New York City congestion pricing infrastructure project continues and is deemed essential. Over the course of the last couple of weeks, New York State and the MTA budget moved the congestion pricing toll revenue into the operating budget versus the MTA capital budget. Our view is that this modestly increases the urgency of this project. All this being said, we have pushed the project to the right a bit, moving approximately $25 million into early 2021. For the balance of TransCore, project activity continues and will continue, but we do expect some projects to be pushed into 2021. Over a longer arc of time, the business case for all electronic tolling may accelerate as a result of the current health pandemic. Essentially, human to human contact paying a toll may be greatly reduced, if not eliminated. TransCore will be ready to execute if this demand driver accelerates. Next slide, please. Turning to some company-specific impacts for the software businesses in our network segment. First, our DAT and ConstructConnect. Both of these businesses have subscription-based revenue models. Both have some exposure to small and medium sized businesses, but also work directly with large enterprises. Both businesses have network benefits that typically exhibit countercyclical behavior. For example, and specific to ConstructConnect, the core product is a lead – is a project lead identification source. As more contractors look for fewer projects, they tend to enter our network to source and bid for new project business. In the first three weeks in April, it's encouraging to see the ConstructConnect network expands modestly. For DAT, the brokers stay connected to the network and take advantage of lower spot rates versus contracted rates and carriers stay connected to find load volumes. iTrade is quite busy connecting food retailers . With an increasing number of grower shippers, we expect minimal disruption here. iPipeline has been super active helping their life insurance customers adapt their products and their underwriting processes in this environment. The outlook remains stable here as well. Relative to foundry, content creation continues. There is a large pipeline of post-production work that is currently being processed as well as continued new animation content creation. As a potential early read for western production, Chinese live-action has restarted on a limited basis. Finally, our alternate site healthcare businesses will perform relatively well but are not spared from some level of impact. Both SHP and SoftWriters customers are being impacted by the lack of hospital-based procedures and the associated outpatient recoveries. For instance, new starts of care for home health are down 30% to 35% versus a year ago. We expect these customers to likely pause buying new products until their patient volumes return. Retention, however, should remain high as our products are needed for cooperation’s. And finally, MHA's revenues are tied to pharmaceutical utilization across long-term care settings. Starting now and likely for several quarters into the future, new admissions into long-term care settings will likely slow. However, this should only modestly impact the growth rate of MHA. Next slide, please. Turning to our Measurement & Analytical Segment. Q1 revenues grew 3% organically to $365 million. EBITDA was $123 million or 33.6% of revenue. The quarter was highlighted by strong growth at Verathon amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Unrelated to C-19, Verathon saw continued traction in their new single-use bronchoscope products. Additionally, Northern Digital and Neptune continued their solid string of growth. Also, we did experience declines, as expected, in our short-cycle industrial businesses with some further weakening in the quarter due to COVID-19. Turning to the outlook. This segment can be analyzed across four areas: Verathon, other medical products, Neptune and industrial. At Verathon, we are experiencing truly unprecedented demand for their GlideScopeAmid products. Intubation procedures have skyrocketed due to COVID-19. Verathon's video intubation products enable the caregiver to intubate a patient with appropriate spatial distance from the patient, making the intubation procedure meaningfully less risky for the caregiver. The demand for these products is global and has been sustained since the middle of March. Our other medical product businesses, which grow organically MSD like Clockwork in virtually all environments, are likely negatively impacted based on the global nature of historically lower hospital-based volumes and the associated economic impact. Hospitals have never been forced to defer all non-emergency cases. Neptune is a very stable growth business due to the consistent required meter upgrade and replacements. Given the shelter in-place requirements, limited access to indoor meters and municipality budget uncertainties, some level of sales activity will likely push to the right with the most acute impact being in the second quarter. Finally, our industrial businesses are negatively impacted and generally tied to industrial output. Our industrial products are critical to industrial production processes. There are some pockets of strength, Danisco, Party [ph] and Hansen, but for this group, our revenues for these businesses will be tied to the pacing of plant reopenings. And as a green shoot, we are seeing strong activity across Chinese end markets as our markets come back online. Next slide, please. Turning to our Process Technologies segment. Revenues were $142 million in the quarter, down 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA was $46 million or 32.4% margins. This was a difficult quarter for these businesses, and we expect the outlook to remain extremely poor for the balance of 2020. We saw our upstream businesses decline in the high teens in the quarter. Also, CCC was weak based on the inability to perform field service work all related to C19. One bright spot in the quarter was Zetec, up mid-single digits based on growth from their new non-disruptive testing products. The outlook for the balance of the year is going to be an extremely challenging one. About 60% of the segment's revenue and about 6% of Roper's revenue is related to oil and gas. We will be hit the hardest, down approximately 50% in the second quarter in our upstream business. For the year, upstream revenues will be less than $100 million or roughly 2% of Roper. We do not expect the recovery at all in 2020. Our mid and downstream businesses are also meaningfully negatively impacted, but less so than our upstream businesses. Peso recovery here will be gated by CCC's ability to get into the field and perform field service work and the recovery of fuel refining for PAC. Next slide, please. As we turn to our guidance, we are initiating DEPS guidance for 2Q in the range of $2.50 to $2.70 and updating our full year DEPS guidance to be between $11.60 and $12.60 per share. Embedded in this guidance model is an increased full year tax rate of 23%. We built this model, as we always do, on a business by business, bottoms-up analysis. We have summarized the organic outlook for each segment for the second quarter and the full year with the underlying material assumptions. For application software, we see second quarter revenue down MSD, with full year revenue plus or minus low single digits. Where we settle for the full year is dependent upon the volume and timing of add-on perpetual deals, the pacing of services work and sustaining high recurring revenue retention rates. For network systems, we've seen second quarter organic revenues up low single digits and full year up mid-single digits to possibly low double digits. The largest variable is the pacing of the New York congestion pricing project. For MAS, we see this segment down mid-single digits in the second quarter and flat to up mid-single digit for the year. Principal factors for this segment are the sustained nature of Verathon's demand spike, the timing of medical procedures coming back online, the nature of water municipality budgets and the ramp of global industrial production. Finally, our process segment will be materially and negatively impacted. We expect 2Q revenues to be down at least 30% and full year down in the 20% to 25% range. Again, we do not expect recovery this year. When you roll all this together, we expect our consolidated organic revenues to be down mid-single digits for the second quarter. And for the full year, organic revenues are expected to be plus or minus low single digits. Again, this is a remarkable testament to the durability of our businesses and business model. Our teams did a good job responding to the demand shock and placing cost countermeasures in place, the vast majority of which being temporary. This enabled us to remain – this enables us to maintain high margins as we work through the demand shock retain virtually all no regrets investments and innovation and talent while preserving the operational flexibility to rebound quickly. Now let's turn to our summary. We had a very solid Q1, really proud of the team here for these results. As we quickly pivot towards operating in a C19 world, our enterprise remains fully operational, and working from home is proving to be highly effective. So effective that we'll likely remain in this posture for quite some time. Our balance sheet is stronger than at any point in history, with $1 billion in cash and $2.5 billion of revolver capacity. For the full year, we expect to have plus or minus flat organic revenue growth. We believe our portfolio of businesses and our governance processes are well suited to navigate this extremely difficult time. We will do so in a way that prudently balances short financial performance and cost countermeasures with that of long-term investments in innovation and talent. Our teams are keenly focused on market share gains, both now and upon recovery. As we execute our strategy that focuses on long-term cash flow compounding, we will continue to patiently evaluate and pursue capital deployment opportunities. Our process is rigorous and disciplined. We do expect many attractive capital deployment opportunities to arise from the current economic situation. As our balance sheet is very well positioned, we will offensively deploy capital as the right opportunities are identified. Final slide, please. As we prepare for your questions, I wanted to highlight a few examples of how Roper businesses are aiding in the fight against COVID-19. Our lab businesses enabled a new C-19 test to interface with lab information systems and provide results to doctors and patients. iTrade is connecting new food trading relationships as food buying shifted almost entirely to grocers. Strata is using their AI tools to help hospitals have financial clarity in these uncertain times. And Verathon, as discussed, is truly on the front lines. I'm extraordinarily proud to be able to lead this organization. Now let's turn to your questions.
Operator: Operator: Thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Dean.
Deane Dray: It's great to hear everyone's voice on the call. And I just want to thank you for all the additional color that you provided today on both the application software and network software business models in the mix. That was helpful. And that last slide on all the ways you're participating in the COVID defense, that was great to see as well. So Neil, for the first question, it's the idea here is most companies are drawing on revolvers. You're obviously not doing that. You're at much stronger position. But keeping $1 billion in cash at the ready to deploy an M&A at the appropriate time, can you talk through the – when will be the appropriate time? Because will these – there be targets in distress that would be opportunistic? Because it typically takes a while for prices to reset in a downdraft like this. So maybe kind of set expectations on when and how you deploy M&A here? Thanks.
Neil Hunn: Sure. Appreciate the question. In any environment, it's hard to predict the timing of capital deployment because, as you know, it's lumpy. But a few comments. First, leading into the shutdown, leading into the middle of March, we were extraordinarily active and pause several things and believe at the right time, we can unpause those things. Only time will tell there. But we stay in constant contact with the owners of those assets, the leadership team for those assets. And these were very late-stage sort of situations. On the – but once we work through that, sort of, late-stage part of the pipeline, there continues to be some level of discussions between sponsors and ourselves. We've spent years developing relationships. We know the portfolio as well. And this is the time where those relationships matter the most, because it's unlikely that here in the next couple, three, four, five months, how long it is, that there's going to be broad-based sell-side processes. But sponsors still have requirement to get liquidity back to their shareholders. And if there's one-off trades that make sense for both sides, we think those could happen. And then finally, they're more likely than not, we saw it in the last downturn in 2007, 2008, 2009 time frame as we studied that. I wouldn't call them just – they're just – there are likely be some companies that are distressed from a capital structure point of view, not from an operating point of view, which gives them -- sort of, they put them in a pinch to where we're able to acquire nice assets, operating assets and meet all of our criteria, but they just have made some poor decisions or have some bad timing on their capital structure. So there's really -- it's the nature of where we sort of target might change modestly, because you're right, it does take typically a couple of quarters, plus or minus, for private valuations to reset to where public ones are.
Deane Dray: That's real helpful. And then a follow-up for Rob on working capital. You said that there was -- you might be seeing some delayed payments. Can you elaborate on that? And when you said you expect working capital to remain negative, was that a comment for quarterly or for the year? And how do you think the quarterly stacks out for -- in terms of being negative each quarter? Thanks.
Rob Crisci: Yeah. Good morning, Deane. Appreciate the question. It's always difficult to predict working capital, right? It's one of the toughest things to predict. We certainly know that there are some end markets, particularly acute care, healthcare, where if you call the news, there's going to be some challenges there where hospitals are slowing some payments, et cetera. So difficult to predict each quarter. I will say that our customers overall were in very durable end markets. And so, we expect really no credit risk across all of our customers. So it's a matter of timing of payments. And when you have the huge deferred revenue balance, when you have management teams, they're really close to their customers. We feel really confident that the working capital position will remain very strong and negative throughout the year.
Deane Dray: That's very helpful. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Steve.
Rob Crisci: Good morning, Steve.
Steve Tusa: Thanks for all the detail. Every quarter, more successive detail on all the businesses. It's very helpful in helping us some industrial analysts understand these tech businesses. So I appreciate that. On the second quarter guide, the – it looks to me like your sales are down like $85 million -- $80 million to $90 million, just using kind of a mid-single-digit rate maybe. And – but the EPS decline of like $0.45 seems to be a pretty high decremental. Is that just kind of the nature of the business? How to – can you kind of just help us walk to kind of the profit performance there? Anything moving around mix wise?
Neil Hunn: Yeah. I'll start, and then I'll ask Rob to add any color. So obviously, the – this demand shop for every company came fast and deep, right? So we started feeling it across a few of our companies at the end of the quarter. And then obviously, it's sustained here through the first part of April. So a couple of comments. So first, when this happened, just from a planning perspective, we first – we didn't try to overreact or react too quickly. We first had to get everybody home, which took a week or two. We then took a week to 10 days to let our leaders really onboard and accept the reality of the demand shock. And then we started our planning process, which was really the first week or so in April. So sometimes takes by. And so by the time you do the planning process in the second quarter and then start putting in the cost countermeasures, it was really just starting to layer in now against what we believe is going to be the steepest demand shock. And so when you put those two together, you just naturally get sort of the worst leverage, if you will, in 2Q and things stabilized from that point in time.
Rob Crisci: Yes. And I'll just add to that. We talked a lot about the perpetual license timing. And so when you're in the second quarter period where the economy is basically shut down for at least the first month of the quarter. So we're not assuming much, if any, license revenue. As you know, that comes at a really high margin. We do have the TransCore project continuing, which is lower margin. So you're really also looking at some mix impacts, adding on to what Neil said.
Neil Hunn: And then the final thing, Steve, so I should have mentioned at the onset is we're not adding back any of the restructuring costs. So that is a little bit of a headwind in the quarter as well.
Steve Tusa: Got it. How much is that again?
Neil Hunn: It's sub-$10 million.
Steve Tusa: Okay. That makes some sense. And then it's my understanding that in some of these software businesses, you see kind of perhaps a bit of a pause, but then that's kind of a quarterly variance. We're kind of used to some CapEx businesses that are kind of more annual cycles. So that – are you expecting kind of a push on revenues in application software from second quarter into third, so that you kind of have a bit of like pent-up revenue in the second half of the year, if you will? Is that how we should kind of think about this or not really?
Neil Hunn: So Steve, everything's certainly pushing to the right. We've not assumed that there's a – it's a 2Q push that comes back in 3Q. It's just everything sliding to the right. And to the extent what you describe happens, then that would lead us to be more on the higher side of our guidance than the lower side. On the new logo sales, the new customers that are buying relatively high dollar transformational type IT projects, those are going to be pushed to the right for the balance of the year for the most part, right? Who's going to make a big IT investment right now, setting aside how our salespeople actually get to that customer and sell. But the smaller ticket items, the upgrades and the add-on products, that level of activity has actually been quite nice. At Deltek, for instance, the top of the funnel here in the last three or four weeks, like this is the inquiries are up 30% to 35% versus a year ago. Now some of that is everybody's sitting at home doing Google searches, right? So the quality of that top of the funnel may not be as high. But what's been accepted as sales acceptance leads at Deltek has actually paced even a little bit ahead of last year. So the exact nature of how this thing is going to unfold because it's more of a shock than a cycle is yet to be seen.
Steve Tusa: Sorry, one more for you. Any impact to MHA? I know that obviously, nursing homes and those types of things are having a real hard time right now dealing with all of this in certain areas, kind of struggle to understand whether that's it's obviously negative in life, but whether it's negative or positive for your business. How does that work here with the stress in nursing homes?
Neil Hunn: Yeah. So certainly, the number of new admissions to the skilled nursing, or SNF, sort of, care setting is likely going to be paused for quite some time, right? We're not putting in the elderly population in that care setting. So that – because the census, if you will, in SNFs, is going to be impacted by that. That will have some, but it'd be a modest and slow building impact, negative impact to the growth rate for MHA. What still happens, we're not seeing any meaningful discharges, right? The people that are in this setting for a long ark of time, they're not being pulled out because of what's going on. And this is just one of many growth drivers at MHA, right? You still have pricing that goes up. You still have pharmaceutical consumption per capita that goes up. You still have the team building to put new products online. There still are new pharmacies that will start that we'll capture. So there's a handful of sort of consistent growth drivers. But certainly, census levels will moderate some in the skilled nursing facility, which will impact the growth rate of modestly of MHA.
Steve Tusa: Great. Thanks for the color guys. I appreciate it. Best of luck.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey. Good morning, everyone. This is John for Julian. Maybe switching back to working capital first. Can you talk a bit on how the unearned revenue is going to kind of play with that expectation? How well has that been holding up? And how much of a headwind can that be with AS guided down for Q2?
Rob Crisci: Yeah, sure. This is Rob. The way deferred revenue works for our software businesses is, it's just the passage of time that needs to happen in order for the revenue to be recognized. And so, as I mentioned on the call, it is – when you have a renewal, then – and then that's the point at which you hope the customer renews or they don't. And generally, they do at very high 90% renewal rates. And those renewals are time throughout the year. So as long as you maintain your recurring revenue, it's very, very steady. The deferred revenue continues to grow as the software businesses grow. A reminder, we're selling this software. It's really critical software systems across durable markets, like government contractors, mostly large enterprises to the customers. And so it's very, very steady. It gives you high levels of recurring revenue and high levels of cash flow. So we don't see any meaningful impact from that certainly in the short term.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And then I guess maybe on that guided decline for next quarter, it does sound like a big chunk of that is just push out of licensing and so on. But is there any impact from kind of the mix here moving much more towards license and service rather than perpetual just being down to 10% now kind of as you say?
Neil Hunn: Well, certainly, we expect the bucket of revenue of perpetual license revenue, the historical 10% number, that will be down. It will be impacted for the reasons that we talked about. The recurring won't be impacted in any meaningful way and the services backlog will work through the back -- the services teams to work through the backlog, as we've said. So I don't know if you have...
Rob Crisci: Yeah. And then, just, as you go through the guidance, keep in mind, we did increase the tax rate. So that's a big difference from prior guidance and if you're looking at last year versus this year. So the tax rate is a little bit higher. And then we are assuming relatively high deleveraging and process technologies, given all the declines there and that we're not assuming any sort of a rebound. And as Neil mentioned, we're taking specific cost actions as well that are flowing through. So those are all key drivers in the roll up.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Rob Crisci: Hey, Joe.
Joe Giordano: Hey, I apologize if you went through some of the stuff with kind of quadruple passing this morning a little bit. So for TransCore, I know you mentioned in the prepared remarks, you pushed some off into next year. I don't think that should be too surprising. But given some of the stuff that's been in the paper recently about necessary permits and issues with different government agencies, can you talk about what actually needs to happen before this is able to be before the actual hardware can be deployed?
Neil Hunn: Yes. The hardware is being deployed. The project is on track. It's on pace other than just pushing this $25 million in our planning assumptions into the Q1 of next year. What you may have read and what others have read is there – I think there is a distinct separation between the work that we're doing with our customer to put the infrastructure in, which is pacing for the reasons we said. It's now the revenue from this or the operating budget, not the capital budget because the MTA, obviously, revenues are way down, given what's going on. And then what happened – governmental process to enable and structure the tolling itself. That's going to happen at a very – in part of next year, but the infrastructure work continues, and that's our planning assumption. All the signals and all the discussions, as you can imagine, we stay very, very close with this customer, and we're in the same posture on that together with a customer.
Joe Giordano: So does – I guess, would that put potentially like to push on some of the recurring revenue associated with this if there's some issue with like a go-live so you get your deployment and then there could be like a delay in when stuff actually goes on?
Neil Hunn: Yes, it could. If we ultimately don't go in, then the maintenance part would not turn on would be our planning assumption there. But I think there's a pretty high level of interest by all parties to see this project turn on.
Joe Giordano: Yes. Okay. And then again, you probably went through this a little bit. But on the software backlog that you have, like can you just talk me through how you're thinking about that in terms of whether it's a six-month or a year? Like what do you – what are you modeling in, in terms of like companies being smaller and needing less licenses and stuff like that?
Neil Hunn: So well, there's a couple of different questions embedded there.
Joe Giordano: Yes. I know.
Neil Hunn: So first – but first of all, you have to go company by company. So really, all we're talking about in our comments where we see a meaningful headwind on the license activities at our application software business. We went company-by-company on the network side. The recurring nature, they'll be impacted, but doesn't have the license activity because they're all SaaS businesses there. So when you look at application software, it's really the combination of those companies there that are going to likely not have large new customer perpetual deals happen in this environment. The smaller products, the add-on projects, the upgrade projects, the increased functionality, the how do you turn on, do some SaaS conversions, right, during this process, during the current economic environment, the activity in the sales funnel suggests that's going to continue, but currently five or six weeks end of situation, we have to see how that continues. So that's on the license side. On the services side, the services work results from selling licenses. So there'll still be some of that. And then there's a fair amount of upgrades that happened. And actually, when times like this are actually a pretty decent time to upgrade systems, because you have maybe less people in the office and less user activity, so the IT staff to do what they need to do to get to a new version. Now we have to see if it actually plays out. But even if it doesn't, even if that has slowed, the services teams work off a six to 12-month services backlog of implementation, they basically have six to 12 months to replenish the backlog from new sales activities.
Unidentified Analyst: Perfect. So fair to say you're assuming that the big – like essentially like a zero and new big licensing and things like that for now.
Neil Hunn: Well, again, you've got to parse it out, right? It's very low large new logos assumed in the planning horizon. There is going to be some new licensing for the product add-ons. That's exactly right.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys. 
Neil Hunn: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Blanton of Clear Harbor Asset Management.
Alex Blanton: Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Alex, Good morning 
Rob Crisci: Hey, Alex.
Neil Hunn: I hope you’re well.
Alex Blanton: Typically, during recessions, dominant companies like Roper gained market share, a lot of market share, in some cases, from weaker competitors. And it seems to me that, that would be true right now in spades. Could you comment on where you would expect the greatest cash effective Roper. You're gaining share from companies that get in trouble during this period.
Neil Hunn: I appreciate the question. No. It's a – we agree with your sentiment. History would suggest that's the case. When you have the operational readiness that we have, when you have the balance sheet that we have, when you have the cash flow that we have, sort of amount of those heartily needs allows us to very quickly pivot to play offense versus defense, and that's the posture that we're leaning, right? We also talked in our prepared remarks about our direct channel access. So we're talking across all of our businesses every day with our customers. Where the opportunities are, it's incrementally, and I don't – I mean, it's in all the businesses. I don't want to sort of call out one business there where there's a disproportionate opportunity, because it's a structural opportunity with our business model that we have across the 45 businesses. But we agree there is times to fulfill need right now when our competitors cannot fulfill a product that garners you sort of an opportunity to capture and keep that share of momentum building on that side of this thing. So we agree with the sentiment and we're alternatively leaning forward, but we've got to do that in a prudent way, given the current situation we all face.
Alex Blanton: Right. Then you mentioned that you keep in very close touch with your customers, so you can identify these opportunities when they arise.
Neil Hunn: That's correct.
Alex Blanton: I have one more question on your – on the acquisition outlook. You mentioned that there's a delay implementing some of the sellers, plans to sell the businesses, which is understandable. But could you characterize the backlog? You said it was a very full backlog or pipeline of acquisition opportunities. Could you expand on that a bit?
Neil Hunn: Sure. Sure.
Alex Blanton: Because you've got a highly talented…
Neil Hunn: Correct. There's always a lot of activity that happens in our pipeline. I've been here since 2011. For the first six or seven years is my responsibility to manage the pipeline, in addition to my operating responsibilities. And so just speaking over the whole time I've been here, there's a lot of activity. What we're specifically commenting on earlier is there was very late-stage activity. Under exclusivity, most terms agreed to most diligence done a few deals that we just decided it was prudent to pause and take stock of the current situation. So there's a late-stage pipeline. Now the things right behind that, most – every other process, sales process that was in the market has pulled for obvious reasons. And so we're going to have to lean into our knowledge of the existing sponsor relationships and relationships that we have to see if we can build funnel on a proprietary basis for the next couple of quarters. And only time will tell if we're going to be able to successfully do that. And then from that point, private equity business models need to return capital to their Limiteds, and we expect that to continue once the new reality of the valuation regime, the leverage regime, all sort of land on us all.
Alex Blanton: Okay. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy of Stephens.
Robert McCarthy: Thanks for fitting me guys. How are you doing today?
Neil Hunn: Great. Hope you are well?
Robert McCarthy: Good. Yes, just expanding on kind of the private equity on the acquisition environment. Obviously, a situation where as Deane suggested, prices are coming down. But I mean, could you see a phenomenon here of – as private equity has a lot of businesses that are probably highly impacted more than what their risk characteristics would have suggested that you could provide the ATM on some decent deals where they could get an exit, so there could be a liquidity premium to getting something out, returning it to Limiteds and you could still pick off some decent businesses at some reasonable valuations? Do you think there's a path forward for that? And maybe just expand more broadly about your acquisition capacity in cancer?
Neil Hunn: Yes. So on the capacity side, it's going to – it's $2 billion to $3 billion right now very easily. We're going to be prudent in how we deploy that and always be very mindful of the current situation we're in. Relative to the first part of your question, I think it depends on the sponsor, right? If you talk to some of these very large, highly successful sponsors who have raised eight to 15 funds and returned three to 5x, might after their Limiteds are going to have a lot of patients with them as they work through this. So those assets and those portfolios, I think, waits a little longer. On the other hand, there's scores of more middle market sponsors that do not have that track record that probably exhibit the exact behavior that their outlying. And so only time will tell, but it's our job to identify those opportunities as they come up.
Robert McCarthy: Thank you for that. And then I guess in terms of thinking about the longer-term opportunity with CBORD and also TransCore mean obviously, episodically, companies have been talking about changing the regime for not only payments but also access, particularly given the light of the pandemic. I mean, you're going to probably see a reconfiguration of security and access around motion as opposed to touch, just given the nature of sanitation and public hygiene, do you think that creates a bit of an opportunity for you in each of those businesses, or do you think it's a little bit too much of a nuance right now?
Neil Hunn: I think it does over the medium term, right? So there's the Seaboard, it's the work we've done with Apple for contactless sort of entry and security. I think also the way that in the near term, at least, universities are going to want to follow where the students are, and so we might be able to be assistants – assist them in that. TransCore, we talked about the concept of handing cash and getting change back is likely going to end here at some point. And then also, RFID is a business we all talk a whole lot about. We talked about in the quarter -- I mean, in the quarter, they had a very strong quarter. They're all about contactless reading for identity access, for instance, in hospitals and health systems for secure print, right? So how do you actually go to a printer and get your materials off without having to touch it. So they enable those sorts of solutions from a product perspective.
Robert McCarthy: Thanks for your time.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We would now like to turn the call back to Zack Moxcey for closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-30 08:30:00) =====
Operator: The Roper Technologies’ Fourth Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. Today's conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Zack Moxcey.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning. And thank you all for joining us as we discuss the fourth quarter and full year financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter and year primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to acquire deferred revenue; and lastly, a gain on sale related to the divestiture of Gatan. And now if you'll please turn to Slide 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. As usual, we'll start with our fourth quarter consolidated highlights. We'll then turn to discuss our Q4 results on a segment basis. I'll then turn the call over to Rob to review our full year financial results. Then I'll walk us through the full year details and next year's outlook on a segment-by-segment basis followed by our consolidated full year and Q1 2020 guidance. I'll conclude with a brief summary prior to turning the call over to your questions. Next slide, please. Q4 for Roper was a very solid quarter. Revenue grew 1% organically and came in at $1.4 billion with positive organic growth in three of our four segments and this was largely based on the strength of our software franchises, our medical product and RF product businesses and Neptune. As a partial offset to this growth, we did see our short-cycle industrial and upstream oil and gas businesses decline as expected in the quarter. However, margin performance for the quarter was really fantastic. Gross margins grew 60 basis points to 64.1% and EBITDA grew 4% to $518 million, which represented an EBITDA margin of 37%, a record for Roper. Also in the quarter, DEPS grew 5% and our free cash flow of $453 million was 32% of revenue. That's free cash flow of 32% of revenue for the quarter. This margin performance in the face of short-cycle industrial and oil and gas headwinds, it's a perfect proof point regarding Roper’s business model. One that is comprised of niche-oriented businesses with highly variable cost structures that have aligned management teams and incentive systems that enable nimble and swift execution based on the prevailing market conditions. Performance across the enterprise is excellent this year. I'd like to thank each of our business leaders and all of our employees worldwide for another record performance for Roper. Thank you. Also and importantly, we successfully completed the divestiture of Gatan in October of last year. In combination with the sale of the camera businesses earlier in the year and this year’s $2.4 billion of capital deployment, our portfolio has been meaningfully improved to continue our long-term cash flow compounding. Also, during the fourth quarter, we spent time with each of our businesses in person discussing their long-range strategy and focusing on where each business plays, how they will compete and win and discussing market trends, customer behaviors, and competitor activity. Then we talked to each businesses enablement and execution of strategy and conclude with a discussion regarding each of our businesses’ activities regarding talent development. We are all encouraged by these planned reviews and our businesses’ orientation towards investing in both product and channel opportunity to drive sustained long-term and CRI-accretive growth. Next slide, please. Turning to our fourth quarter P&L, we saw revenues increased to $1.4 billion which was a 2% increase and 1% on an organic basis. As mentioned on the prior slide, gross margins expanded 60 basis points to 64.1% and EBITDA margins grew 100 basis points to a record 37.0% in the quarter. Finally, our DEPS grew 5%, all-in-all, a very solid quarter. Next slide, please. As we turn to our fourth quarter segment results, I'll start with our Application Software segment. Revenues for the segment were $411 million or plus 2% on an organic basis. EBITDA came in at $164 million or 40.0% margin. We continue to see strength across the group of Application Software companies, especially at Aderant, Data Innovations and Strata. Deltek also had a strong quarter highlighted by continued double-digit, actually high teens ACV bookings growth. Revenues for Deltek were a touch light of our expectations due to a few larger GovCon prospects opting for Deltek’s staff ITAR-compliant solution and a handful of perpetual opportunities sliding into 2020. As we reported for several quarters, Deltek’s growth is quite balanced across their GovCon and professional services market and the business continues to perform exceptionally well versus the competition. The segment EBITDA margin performance for this quarter was stunning, improving 190 basis points, great job by the teams. Now turning to our network segment. We saw fourth quarter revenues increased to $431 million or an increase of 3% on an organic basis. Importantly, our software businesses in this segment grew organically 6% in the quarter and the growth was quite broad-based. As a partial offset, we saw TransCore’s revenue decline a bit based on project timing associated with a few non-New York City projects. For the quarter, we saw segment EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points to 45.5%. For our Measurement & Analytical Solutions segment, revenues increased 1% organically to $388 million. Growth in this segment was driven with continued gains at Neptune and broadly across our medical product businesses. Neptune did a nice job clearing the majority of the backlog associated with their newer residential static water meter and our medical products businesses continued to compete and win in the marketplace. Relative to our short-cycle industrial businesses, they modestly declined in the quarter but managed margins extremely well. And finally, as we turn to our Process Technologies segment, we saw this segment declined 6% on an organic basis with revenues of $170 million. Margin performance was quite strong, with EBITDA margins coming in at 38.7%. This quarter's segment performance was expected as we saw pressure in our upstream businesses. Also expected, CCC posted continued gains in the quarter. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO to walk you through our consolidated annual results. Rob?
Rob Crisci: Thanks Neil. Good morning everyone. So turning to Page 8 and looking at our full year income statement performance. Full year organic growth for 2019 was 3%, which was at the low end of our initial organic guidance against a difficult comp of 8% organic growth in 2018. Total revenue growth was also 3%. We had a one point FX headwind and also the impact of the acquisition as well as the divestiture of our Scientific Imaging businesses and Gatan within the year. Our two segments that are primarily software, Application Software and Network Software & Systems, both finished in line with our initial guidance with mid single-digit organic growth for the year. For our largest product segment, Measurement & Analytical Solutions, our medical products businesses, and Neptune had another very strong year of organic growth. While we did have some declines in our short-cycle industrial businesses, which lower the overall organic growth of the segment to 2% for 2019. Lastly, our smallest segment, Process Technologies declined 4% organically for the year, in line with our initial guidance and that was primarily due to the weakness in upstream oil and gas as you had expected. As Neil mentioned for the fourth quarter, we really had outstanding margin execution by our business leaders throughout 2019, driving very strong operating leverage while we're continuing to invest for future growth. If you look at the margins, gross margin for the year, up 70 basis points to 63.9%, EBITDA margin increased to 110 basis points up to a record 35.8% and that drove 7% EBITDA growth for the year. Our tax rate was lower in 2019 at about 19%. So you add all that up, we had a double-digit adjusted DEPS growth of 10% up to $13.5 for the year so really, overall, a very strong year for Roper. Next slide. So looking at our full year cash flow performance, as Neil mentioned in the fourth quarter, we did have $453 million of free cash flow, which is a very strong 32% of revenue. On a full year basis, we exceeded $1.5 billion, which was a 5% increase over prior year. And it's worth noting, many of you are probably on our call in January, 2017 just three years ago when we proudly announced, we had exceeded $1 billion in cash flow for the first time. Well now only three years later, we've eclipsed 1.5 billion for the first time. So at Roper, cash does remain the best measure of performance. Next slide. So speaking of cash is the best measure of performance. The next slide is a look at our multi-year EBITDA growth and cash flow compounding. So if you look at the period from 2016 to 2019, both EBITDA and free cash flow compounded a very strong 14%. So when we think about cash conversion, a metric we like to track internally here is EBITDA to free cash flow. This seems especially relevant as investors have been moving away from P/E towards metrics closer to cash, such as the EV/EBITDA. However, for many companies EBITDA does not consistently convert to free cash flow at high levels. For Roper, it absolutely does. For this period, 2016 to 2019, while our free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings has been consistently well above 100% ranging from 105% to 120%. Free cash flow to EBITDA has also been very consistent between 73% and 76%. This is driven mainly by our asset-light business model with our low capital needs and negative working capital. So as we look forward, our working capital position will continue to become more negative as you’ll see on the next slide and that will further increase our ability to convert EBITDA to free cash flow at very high levels. Next slide. So turning to the asset-light business model slide, maybe our favorite slide aided by Gatan divestiture that we completed in the quarter. We ended the year at negative 5.3% networking capital as a percentage of revenue. This record result actually includes receivables, as you can see close to 18%, which quite honestly is a little bit higher than you would normally like to see, driven largely by the timing of collections for some TransCore projects and some product revenue that came in late in the quarter. So we certainly expect those receivables to be collected here early in 2020 and that number should improve moving forward. But even with the receivables numbers slightly higher, that negative 5.3% represents an 800 basis point improvement over the past three years, really tremendous performance in terms of working capital. And of course, the big driver of that is our deferred revenue. Deferred revenue increased nearly $350 million over this period, driven by organic growth in our software businesses as well as our recent software acquisitions that come in at very attractive working capital levels. So in summary, from a working capital perspective at a record negative 5%, we exit the year better positioned than ever before for future cash flow compounding. Next slide. So looking at the balance sheet, if you look at our full year results, if I look at December 2019 compared to December 2018, net debt is actually down $12 million. Now at the same time period, TTM EBITDA is up $119 million and we end the year with our gross debt-to-EBITDA at 2.7 times and our net debt-to-EBITDA at 2.4 times, largely due to the proceeds from our successful Gatan divestiture. We ended the year with a total cash balance of $710 million with approximately $400 million in the U.S. this is not the norm for us. Now $200 million of this cash will go towards paying the Gatan taxes due in April but if you look at the cash balance, if you look at our revolver, which is now $2.5 billion revolver, fully undrawn, very attractive capital market conditions, which we took advantage of in August and certainly that, we have the capability as we move forward to access the capital market. We are incredibly well positioned to take advantage of a very high quality pipeline of acquisition opportunities in 2020. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to review our 2019 segment performance and 2020 outlook.
Neil Hunn: Thanks Rob. Let's turn to the full year 2019 highlights for our Application Software segment. For the year, revenue came in at $1.589 billion, which represented an increase of 4% on an organic basis and EBITDA was $636 million, an increase of 10% versus the prior year and EBITDA margins were 40.0%. Deltek turned in a great year. Revenues increased mid single-digits on an organic basis and this growth was balanced across both markets, GovCon and Professional Services, as well as across the perpetual and SaaS offerings. Also during the year, Deltek’s product and solution portfolio was meaningfully enhanced. On an organic basis, the company released an ITAR-compliant GovCon SaaS offering and started gaining meaningful traction with its VantagePoint product, the company’s newer professional services SaaS ERP solution. In addition to this organic innovation, Deltek onboarded and integrated two acquisitions, ComputerEase and Avitru both targeted to meaningfully enhance their architectural engineering and construction offer. Aderant had a stellar year. This time last year, we talked about product innovation and Aderant, specifically about three newer SaaS products, based on the market traction of these products, especially their e-billing and mid-law SaaS solutions and combined with Aderant's continued ability to take share in the large law space, Aderant posted double-digit organic growth in the year. Also, in the fourth quarter, we acquired Bellefield Systems for Aderant, which enhances their SaaS solutions targeting the front office of law firms, specifically focused on professional service automation, compliance and timekeeping. As we turn to PowerPlan, we saw double-digit increases in their recurring revenues in the year. These recurring revenue increases were offset by expected declines in their service revenue, which were largely tied to lease accounting product implementation sold and delivered throughout 2018. Strata continues to be a star within Roper, having tremendous organic growth gains this year again. To remind everyone, Strata is our SaaS software business that helps hospitals have better visibility to their financial operations, both costing and revenue. Strata solutions better enable hospital executives to plan and run their hospital operation. Also in the quarter, Strata launched a new product, a new data product called StrataSphere. Today, about 25% of U.S. hospitals operational and financial data runs through Strata’s products. StrataSphere is designed to normalize this data set and provide strata's customers with AI-enhanced insights into the data and content across various customer cohorts. It is very early days of this product, but the team is very excited to partner with our customers to fully develop the products potential. Within our lab software business, Sunquest, our U.S. focused business continued to face the same competitive headwind throughout the year, which we expect to persist into 2020. However, much of this headwind is mitigated by continued organic gains at Data Innovations and CliniSys. Finally, before turning to the segment’s 2020 outlook, we wanted to highlight that CBORD had a great year with very strong organic growth and even better cash performance. As for the outlook for this segment, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth with broad-based growth contributions across the segment. It's worth noting Deltek’s momentum entering this year based on their recent double-digit bookings increases. Next slide please. For the year, revenue for our Network Software & Systems segment came in at $1.539 billion, which represented an increase of 5% on an organic basis. And EBITDA was $681 million, an increase of 17% versus prior year and EBITDA margins were amazing 44.3%. During 2019, we successfully completed the acquisitions of Foundry and iPipeline. While still early, both are off to a great start and have very solid growth contributions plan for 2020. Those management teams have welcomed the Roper approach and are excited to be part of our enterprise. On an organic basis, DAT had a truly amazing year. Their growth has been multifaceted with meaningful contributions coming from expansions to their core freight match network and growth and their rate data offering. MHA had a great year as well. Their growth was a function of continued competitive strength and near 100% customer retention, combined with adding several new contracted pharmaceutical products to their portfolio. In addition to a very solid financial year, the company executed a precedent succession in a near-perfect manner. ConstructConnect had a good year as well. Much of 2019 was focused on launching their new integrated SaaS solution, which they did quite well. ConstructConnect has seen increased ARPU or revenue per user from new customers as these contractors are seeing more value in the integrated bid management and project estimating solution. iTrade was fantastic in 2019. Rob and his team did a tremendous job driving very strong renewals, adding several new customers and positioning the product portfolio for continued long-term network expansion. Finally, TransCore’s year was highlighted by their high profile and large contract win with the New York City congestion pricing infrastructure project. As we turn to the outlook for next year or this year, we see mid-teens organic growth for the segment. Within this outlook, we see mid-single-digit plus organic growth for our network software businesses and very strong organic growth for TransCore on the back of the New York City congestion pricing project. For the first quarter of this year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for the segment. Excluding TransCore, we expect low single-digit growth for the first quarter, given a very challenging Q1 comp for MHA. Specific to TransCore, now that the New York City project details are coming more into view, we expect the majority of TransCore’s growth to occur in Q2 through Q4, though the timing of project revenues will be difficult to forecast with precision, given that we are in the early stages of this large New York City project. Next slide please. For the year, revenue for our Measurement & Analytical Solutions segment came in at $1.596 billion, which represented an increase of 2% on an organic basis and EBITDA was $541 million a decrease of 4% versus the prior year, but EBITDA grew 2%, excluding divestitures. EBITDA margins were 33.9%. For the year, we saw strong execution across our medical product businesses. In total, this grew high single digits organically for the year. Within the medical products businesses, NDI was the star for 2019. This business grew double-digit on the back of very strong adoption of both their electromagnetic and optical precision measurement and guidance solution. Verathon growth in 2019 was driven by meaningful and successful product launch of a single-use bronchoscope and new product extensions across the full GlideScope product family. Both of which we introduced on this call a year ago. In addition, 2019 is the year that is marked by Verathon’s reoccurring consumables revenues becoming larger than their capital-based product revenues. For these reasons, this business is very well positioned for continued strong growth in 2020 and for many years after. Finally, in the medical products group, CIVCO grew nicely again, based on market adoption of their ultrasound guidance and infection control products. Neptune for the year grew mid-single-digits. Importantly, Neptune saw nice increases in our residential static ultrasonic water meter products. In addition, Neptune made very nice gains in our innovation lab relative to the larger gauge commercial and industrial static meters. We continued to feel very good about how Neptune is positioned to compete and win in the marketplace. Turning to our shorter cycle and industrial businesses, these businesses performed very well in 2019 amid challenging end market conditions. As we all know, the market conditions change meaningfully in the second quarter of the year. While the businesses did decline a bit in the year, their early recognition of the changing market conditions and their corresponding expense management was well executed. Of note and of importance, we did see some moderation of their declines in the most recent quarter. Also during the year, we successfully exited our scientific imaging and Gatan businesses and generated $1.2 billion of pretax proceeds. As we turn to 2020, we see this segment growing mid-single-digit organically based on continued strength in our medical products and Neptune franchises. We further expect to see continued industrial declines in the first half and return to modest growth in the second half, largely based on easing 2H comps. Next slide, please. For the year, revenue for our Process Technologies segment came in at $653 million, which was a 4% organic decline for the year. EBITDA was $238 million, a decrease of 4% versus the prior year, and EBITDA margins was 36.4%. Our upstream oil and gas businesses declined high single digits in the year due to the deteriorating market conditions that we discussed throughout the year. However, our CCC business continues to perform well based on the competitive strength in winning virtually all of the new LNG construction projects. In addition, CCC's strategy of increasing their intimacy with their core customers is yielding nice system replacement opportunities. Cornell executed at a very high level throughout the year. They saw a very strong growth across virtually all of their end markets, with particular strength in their ag market offering. In addition, Cornell saw strength across their aftermarket parts business for much of the year. These strengths were offset by declines in their rental markets. All in all, another solid year for Cornell. Finally, we saw EBITDA margins expand across this segment. These businesses increased margins in the face of very uncertain and declining market conditions. This is possible given the very high variable cost nature of the businesses, which provide our business leaders the ability to take cost out extremely fast once weakening market conditions are observed. There is no better example of nimble execution than this. Also, and to this end, we discussed how PAC and CCC had new President onboarded in 2019. Each of these new teams performed exactly as we would have hoped: swiftly, nimbly and with conviction. As we look to 2020, we see this segment declining mid-single digits based on the continued assumptions of upstream oil and gas market difficulties. However, comps do ease in the second half. Next slide, please. Now turning to our 2020 full year guidance. We are establishing our 2020 full year adjusted DEPS guidance in the range of $13.30 to $13.60, with organic revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7%. This organic revenue growth range includes the impact of TransCore's growth associated with their New York City congestion pricing project. Excluding TransCore, organic growth for the enterprise is expected to be in the 3% to 4% range. For the full year, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 22%. For Q1, we expect adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $2.94 and $3 per share. To remind everyone, last year's Q1 had a $0.41 tax benefit. Further, and as discussed earlier, we expect the majority of TransCore's growth to occur in Q2 through Q4. Next slide please. As we look back on 2019, we're very pleased with our results and our strategic process. We continue to see strength in our niche market strategy and governance model that promotes nimble local execution. EBITDA for the year increased 7% to $1.93 billion, and EBITDA margins increased 110 basis points to 35.8%. Adjusted DEPS increased 10% to $13.05 per share. Free cash flow increased to $1.44 billion and was an astounding 27% of revenue. Specific to our portfolio of businesses, we meaningfully improved our business mix. We deployed $2.4 billion toward software acquisitions led by Foundry and iPipeline. We also exited our imaging and Gatan businesses. Finally, I'm very pleased with the improvements we made across the enterprise relative to talent. I feel fantastic about the team in Sarasota. In addition to the existing team, during the year, we onboarded two group executives, Satish and Harold. This team is executing at a very high level, and I'm excited for the future. Also, there are meaningful improvements across our business units in terms of the talent offense they are deploying. We're playing the long game, and I fully expect our talent focus to pay dividends in the years to come. As we turn to 2020, we are super well positioned. First, we expect to deliver fantastic organic growth for the year that will be broad-based across our software platforms, Neptune, medical products, RF products and TransCore. The growth in these parts of our businesses will meaningfully outpace market weakness across our short-cycle industrial and our oil and gas-related businesses. Relative to future capital deployment, we are very offensively positioned to execute our M&A strategy. The sale of Gatan, our attractive August bond issue, $0 drawn on our $2.5 billion revolver and a building cash balance, has our balance sheet wonderfully well positioned. We continue to be very active evaluating new capital deployment ideas, and our pipeline is quite full with high-quality opportunities. We will continue to be very disciplined and hold true to our CRI-based principles, and we are optimistic for a successful year of capital deployment. Now as we turn to your questions, I want to remind everyone that what we do is very simple. We compound cash flow by operating a portfolio of businesses that have leading positions in niche markets that have the proven ability to generate increasing cash flow as their businesses expand. We provide our business leaders with Socratic coaching about what great looks like while driving long-term CRI-accretive growth with particular emphasis focused on strategy, operation, innovation and talent development. Our business leaders understand that success in our culture is based on their ability to compete and win for talent and to compete and win for customers that, in turn, allow us to compete for and win shareholders. To this end, we incent our management teams based on growth. And based on these factors and perhaps most importantly, we have a culture that is rooted in the principles of mutual trust and transparency. And finally, we take the excess free cash flow that is generated by our businesses and deploy it to buy businesses that have better cash returns than our existing company that, in turn, help accelerate our cash flow compounding. It is these simple ideas that deliver powerful results. We appreciate your time this morning. Now let's turn the call over to your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Hey, good morning.
Deane Dray: Because the New York City congestion tolling project is such a high-profile installation for you all, I'd be interested in hearing some more color on how this installation compares to the others that you've done in, let's say, London and Stockholm. Just from a sense of degree of difficulty of the installation, is there any, like, new software? New camera systems? Or is this basically similar to what you've done in these other successful installations?
Neil Hunn: Sure, Deane. So let me first start by saying the congestion pricing infrastructure in those other two cities is not us. So those are not our projects. That said, the technology that's being used in the New York City project is, for the most part, the exact same technology that's been used in any of our larger tolling infrastructure projects. It's the same core hardware. It's the same core software. Certainly, there'll be some tweaks that are needed in the software for the specific application that's being used by MTA in this instance. But the scale of this project is not actually close to the largest that we've deployed. So the team feels quite confident in the technical ability to do it. Further, our customer, MTA has been – is a great partner. And all the sort of the process steps to be able to construct in New York City have largely already been approved. And so it really is just down to executing the project over the course of this year.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then just some more color on the expected – the margin progression for 2020 for the project. It looks like it's starting more into the second quarter. But typically, do you see lower margin early in the project, on the installation, more upfront costs, and just – and then higher margin in the back quarters? Just what's the expectation here, the base case?
Rob Crisci: Yes. Deane, I think that's right. I think you're just getting started with the project here in the first quarter. So we think you'd assume you'd have a little bit less – well, we know we have a little bit less revenue recognition, probably a little bit lower margin, and as we move on throughout the year, both of those will increase quite a bit.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then just last one for me on Deltek. Could you just provide some color or context around the pushouts on the perpetual deals. You said it got pushed into 2020. Is this a first quarter or second quarter? And just what are the – some color around the customer decisions there?
Neil Hunn: Sure. So a couple of things on Deltek. We talked about how their bookings, on an ACV basis, we're quite strong all year, with strength ending the year in the high teens in Q4. So the competing and winning in the marketplace has remained robust throughout the year. Specific to the revenue recognition, it's really a combination of two things here in Q4, being – one is, the company has announced its intention to release an ITAR-compliant version of their cost point product, which is the GovCon ERP product, which really essentially enables that product to be hosted in the cloud and deploy it in the SaaS environment. So there are a couple of deals signed in Q4 taking advantage of that offering. And so that's a great trend for the business because the recurring revenue will increase quite meaningfully as that becomes more – gains more traction. That, combined with the fact that a couple – a handful of meaningfully sized perpetual deals pushed. And so if in the hypothetical world, if the ITAR-compliant SaaS product was not there, likely, these customers would have bought perpetual version. And then Deltek's would have been right in line. So it's really a combination of the SaaS offering gaining traction and a couple of deals pushing into the first or second quarter next year.
Deane Dray: Thank you.
Neil Hunn: You’re welcome.
Operator: And your next question will come from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Thank you, good morning. As you're positioning for substantial allocation as you referenced a few times for this year. Just curious, look back at a few of the larger ones, iPipeline, Foundry, PowerPlan, around management retention, other key metrics on onboarding and anything in particular around those recent deals that's evolving. How you evaluate trade-offs with new opportunities as you're kind of shopping criteria evolves over time.
Neil Hunn: So the criteria for capital deployment really has not changed that much. It's always been rooted in finding businesses that have better cash returns than our existing. Over the arc of 20 years, that's gone from industrial products to medical products, the more software. The second criteria is always having a management team that is fundamentally focused on building the business versus transacting. And then finally, businesses that share the characteristics that all 45 of our businesses do, right, niche, leadership position, ability to invest in themselves to grow, high recurring revenues, high gross margins, et cetera. So those criteria have not changed at all and it won't change going forward. The recent acquisitions that you referenced, certainly the ones really from Deltek, ConstructConnect, Aderant, PowerPlan, Foundry, iPipeline, the larger ones from 2016 forward, have met all those criteria, and the businesses are performing at or maybe modestly above our initial expectations.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And then just curious, in the pipeline, the more actionable end of it as you see it, what's kind of the mix between bolt-ons versus platform opportunities?
Neil Hunn: Yes. The vast majority of our deployment will be on platform ideas. Occasionally, we'll do bolt-ons or tuck-ins as they strategically warrant in the business. It's not a budget. If you just look over our arc of time, about 10% of the capital deployed, it's been in bolt-ons, but it's just been a by-product of how it's unfolded. It's certainly not a budget or a planning number going forward. But my bid will be somewhere in that plus or minus ballpark.
Christopher Glynn: Got you. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: You’re welcome.
Operator: And your next question will come from Robert McCarthy with Stephens.
Robert McCarthy: Good morning, everyone. The first question I have is free cash flow as a percentage of sales for Process Technologies. Do you happen to have that metric or that percentage?
Neil Hunn: We don't. The free cash flow number is a corporate number with all the corporate interest tax, et cetera. So we don't look at it in that way. I would say the business level cash flow. So if you look at sort of EBITDA to revenue, subtracting their CapEx is pretty darn close to their EBITDA because the CapEx is not a big number. And then from a working capital perspective, there's not huge movement there. So it's still a very high number. I can't give you an exact free cash flow number for the…
Robert McCarthy: Okay. But it screens very well in free cash flow by definition then?
Neil Hunn: Absolutely.
Rob Crisci: Absolutely.
Robert McCarthy: Okay. Fair point. And then if you look at your outlook, excluding the drag from process, what do you think you would have grown this year organically?
Rob Crisci: So process for the year was minus 4%. So you're talking 12% of the company. So we would add a – probably a point or 2, just doing the math at the top of my head…
Robert McCarthy: And then in 2020, probably something similar or even higher? Right?
Rob Crisci: That's right.
Robert McCarthy: Okay. And then moving on to TransCore. From that perspective, could you just remind us to level set our expectations in the out-years? How you're thinking about the initial deployment revenue and then conceptually the step-down from there, just so we get our modeling directionally correct in the out-years.
Neil Hunn: Yes. So there's the 200 or so incremental revenue this year. And then there will be some recurring from the project, probably in the $50 million to $60 million range into next year and then into the next several years. So that would then leave the rest of TransCore, and a lot of other projects we're working on, to pick up some of that slack, which they're working hard on already today.
Robert McCarthy: Right. And then last question is really around M&A. Obviously, I think Danaher announced today decent results after a preannouncement, and then I think rebaseline for more – even more favorable financing environment for underwriting one of the deals. So clearly, a pretty attractive environment, which you alluded to on the call in terms of the capital markets and debt for funding these deals. And you talked about the mission bolt-ons. I mean, you look at Neptune, good growth, a great franchise. There is a sense that the smart metering, while albeit at a low rate of growth, maybe in the low single digits, could be very sustainable for a long period of time. And there is some sense that transmission and distribution spending could be entering a higher level of visible spending just given PG&E and some of the return profile of AMI. Is it possible for you guys to think about building around that more than software? Is the utility end market an attractive space? Or how would you think about that?
Neil Hunn: Yes. So Neptune, as you know, is 100% focused in the water meter business, and that's where they're going to be. They're not going to stray to gas or electric meters. And more importantly, it's really water meters in North America, where pressure rates are higher than the rest of the world. So it's a pretty complicated device metering application, both mechanical and ultrasonic. So the company is going to stay focused there. That said, the company now for at least three years has been investing in its software applications and capability because now the readers are being read more frequently. And so there's more use cases that are being developed about what you do with that data around leak detection or shutoff or whatever our customers ask for, Neptune is working to build. The shutoff is a hard case, but leak detection is a good case, for instance, in terms of value to the end user. So they – to that end, they opened an innovation center three years or so ago in Atlanta to attract better talent than they could in their existing locations in more rural Alabama. So it's been a part of the strategy, and I suspect it will remain part of the strategy for quite some time.
Robert McCarthy: Thanks for the questions.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Hey, good morning.
Steve Tusa: You mentioned PowerPlan saw some solid growth in a part of its business. What did ultimately PowerPlan grow for the year in total?
Rob Crisci: Yes, PowerPlan for the year was down a little bit. We think it will be up in 2020 full year, including the first quarter.
Steve Tusa: Okay. And then ConstructConnect as well, did that grow this year?
Rob Crisci: It did.
Neil Hunn: Yes, it grew in 2019.
Steve Tusa: Is that like low singles or something like that or?
Rob Crisci: Correct.
Neil Hunn: Yes, low single.
Steve Tusa: And then lastly, just for the – just for modeling purposes, I know you have the Gatan sale headwind on revenue next year. What are the – what's the carryover acquisition-related tailwind that we should add to kind of that organic growth outlook? So on a reported basis?
Rob Crisci: Yes. So I've got – so from an EBITDA standpoint, there's about $70 million of EBITDA from the acquisitions. That's an add and then you take away about $50 million of EBITDA from Gatan. So it's a net around $20 million of EBITDA.
Steve Tusa: And then on sales?
Rob Crisci: Yes. On sales, it's going to be – I don't have the exact number. I'll have to follow-up with you on that, but it's going to be roughly – you have it, Shannon?
Shannon O'Callaghan: Yes. It nested on 0.
Rob Crisci: Yes. It nested 0 on revenue.
Steve Tusa: 0 on – 0 carryover with – including Gatan?
Rob Crisci: Yes. Yes. Because the Gatan is a lower margin.
Steve Tusa: Okay. And then, sorry, one last one. Just on first quarter organic, you mentioned that there is some TransCore impact, because you talked about first quarter growth in that segment, ex-TransCore. I guess, ex-TransCore in the first quarter, is it 2 to 3, 1 to 2? Or is it not even that, like, meaningful on an enterprise basis?
Rob Crisci: It's not too meaningful. There's some incremental revenue from TransCore there in the first quarter. But it's not a big add to the first quarter. And as I think you know, Q1 last year was 6% organic. So they're really – it's just a matter of the comps. If you look at the software businesses, for example, it's just the comps that the – is the only difference as we move forward throughout the year.
Steve Tusa: Got it. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
Rob Crisci: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question will come from Richard Eastman with Baird.
Richard Eastman: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just could you possibly just give some commentary around the profit associated with the MTA contract? And then what's – what might be the cadence there? I mean, is that a – just an EBIT or EBITDA contribution from that contract? And is it – does it scale up meaningfully as the revenue grows there? Or is – just some feel for what that could add, so I can get kind of a sense per share on a quarterly basis, given our revenue assumptions.
Rob Crisci: Yes. So I think as you're aware, the TransCore business margin is below the Roper average. And so this business is going to be in that range. And I think the margins do improve after the first quarter moving forward. Exactly how linear that's going to be, is difficult to predict, as Neil mentioned, given what goes on with the project, but it certainly will get a little bit better after the first quarter, and it's probably going to be relatively consistent throughout the rest of the year as our – is our best estimate as we sit here today.
Richard Eastman: So okay. So it comes in at TransCore's average contribution?
Neil Hunn: Correct.
Rob Crisci: That's correct.
Richard Eastman: Okay.
Neil Hunn: That's correct. And it'll be a little more profitable in the back three quarters in the first quarter, but it's not something where it's breakeven Q1, 10% Q2 and 40% in Q4. It's not anything like that at all.
Richard Eastman: And you referenced this just a couple of minutes ago. I think somebody asked a similar question around – so $200 million is still the right expectation around year one this year, and then I think on a previous call, it was maybe $50 million to finish off the project in year two. But then the other $250 million of the contract essentially was years three to seven on a service contract. Is that still kind of roughly the schedule?
Rob Crisci: Yes. That's correct. Yes, so there's like, what we've said $50 million recurring after 2020 goes on for five years, and we would hope it would go on many years after that as you get a chance to renew the maintenance part.
Richard Eastman: Right. Okay. And then just a second follow-up question around Roper's core EBITDA. Fantastic year from the margin perspective for the full 2019. The puts and takes here, maybe a little bit around MTA contract as well as your commentary around a minus mid-single-digit growth for the Process Tech piece of the business in 2020. What might be a reasonable assumption in basis points for targeted EBITDA margin expansion for Roper in 2020? Would a reasonable target be 50 or?
Rob Crisci: Yes so – Yes. No. I think embedded in our initial guidance as it normally is, is that EBITDA margins will be roughly flat year-over-year. There's maybe a little bit of an increase. But certainly, the TransCore project is a negative. And then some declines in those more cyclical businesses is generally a negative to your margin. And the flip side of that is excellent growth at the software businesses, which is a net positive. And if you add all those things together, our initial signs model has the EBITDA margins about flat year-over-year, and we'll work to do a little bit better than that.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then, if you mind, could I just sneak one more in, please. Just the transportation business within network software, that – the freight matching business is just another tremendous year in a tough – fairly tough trucking industry, I guess, if you will. Is that a countercyclical business as things get tough in the trucking industry, we're looking to optimize our assets there by matching freight? And just maybe explain that business a little bit and then maybe what the prospects are for 2020.
Neil Hunn: Sure. I'll take that one, Rick. So first, DAT, let's define what they are. It's full truckload, spot market North America freight match, right. So it is a niche industry. There's captive, there's contracted and there's spot markets. But what we have observed here over the last really two or three years with DAT is their network strength, right, it's a – their relative market share is three-ish versus their competitor, right. So their network is three times the size their next largest competitor. That network strength has proven to play well when the trucking markets are super hot and when they weak. So step back from that, why is that, right. So if you're a carrier, and it is a very hot market. The carrier is going to want to be very selective in their routes. Maybe they're going from Kansas City, Chicago, and they want to go right back to Kansas City. So they're going to be a network participant to be able to select specifically what they want. So you see active participation. And then conversely, the brokers are looking for the capacity. When things lighten up, the truckers are looking for work, right. So they become less selective. And so the value proposition of participating in the network on both sides of the network in both market conditions tend to be quite robust.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And outlook for 2020? I mean, do we kind of sustain the current growth rate? Or do we settle down? It's just there's – it seems around the fringes, there's more competition in that space, but you guys have maneuvered quite well there.
Neil Hunn: Yes. There is – there really isn't more competition in the freight matching space. That said, this company has done so well for a number of years. We do expect the growth to moderate a bit in 2020.
Rob Crisci: Just based on the activity in the market is the only thing driving that.
Neil Hunn: That said, we expected this business to moderate for the last few years as well and they've outlasted our expectations.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: Yes.
Operator: And your next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Julian Mitchell: Thanks a lot. Maybe just trying to keep my questions a little briefer. Maybe starting with the Software-as-a-Service model. You've spent some time in the prepared remarks discussing that. Just wondered with that strength in Q4, what's the overall scale of your SaaS business now within Roper? And relating to the profitability on that, I think in Q2, you'd had a SaaS kind of mix surge and that had hurt margins in Application Software. Q4, it seems like SaaS did very well again, and may be contributing positively to the margin mix. So maybe help us understand the margin dynamics as that SaaS share of sales expands.
Rob Crisci: Yes. So we're still about even in between the SaaS revenue and the traditional on-prem license maintenance revenue within our software businesses. And from a margin perspective, there really isn't that large of a difference in terms of EBITDA margin between those two business models for our businesses. It's – where the variability happens, as Neil mentioned, is when you get a new license win in a quarter, all that revenue is recognized immediately. If you get a new SaaS win in a quarter, that revenue is recognized over the next 12 months and beyond. So that's the only difference. But from a margin standpoint, there isn't a lot of change within the two models.
Neil Hunn: Yes, I think the 2Q point you're referencing is Deltek had two very large perpetual deals in 2Q of 2018, which drove outsized margin and that's very specific. So it's a very hard comp coming over in 2Q of 2019, if my memory serves correct.
Julian Mitchell: Thank you. And then maybe for Neil. You mentioned talent development in your prepared remarks. Maybe expand a little bit what you're hoping to see from those group executive roles this year? And also, I think, a bit more of a push on organic growth is underway at Roper. In that context, maybe just if you could highlight what the R&D spending was in 2019? I know we'll see it in the K, but maybe how you see the cadence of R&D developing?
Neil Hunn: Sure. All right. If these are short questions, Julian, and I'd hate to hear a long one. So I'll try to hit the talent, the group, the organic and the R&D. So I'll hit the organic first. So we said that it's my intention objective to position the company, reporting of my businesses to execute our organic growth strategy that's been a little bit better in the past. That said, this is going to take time because we want to do it structurally. We want to do it – we're playing the long game. And importantly, we're going to only do it to the extent that CRI accretive. And so this is going to take a long time. And success, by the way, is measured by 50 or 100 basis points more of organic growth, not doubling the organic growth profile because these businesses are built for defensibility, yet we haven't met a Roper business that's optimized its organic growth algorithm. And so we believe there's long-term, I'll emphasize long-term, potential there. Now we're going to do that through the group executives, engaging with our teams, principally on three things: how to develop strategy, how to execute strategy and how to run a talent offense. And so we can spend more time later sort of unpacking that because it's a passion of ours here to do that. But we believe sort of the right strategy with the right strategic enablement, with putting the right field – the right team on the field, will yield great results for our shareholders over a long arc of time. Specific to your R&D spend. In 2020, for the software businesses, but basically both software segments. We're planning on 70 or 80 basis points more spend in R&D. So when you multiply that through, it's $20 million or $25 million of incremental spend in R&D relative to the revenue and that sort of spread across where the best opportunities are in each one of the businesses. And that – we'd expect that pace to – I can't tell you if it's that exact number of basis points each year, but expect that number to continue to increase over time as it naturally does in software businesses. And that is embedded in everything Rob mentioned earlier about margins being flat for the year and margins that – everything he talked about. So that's my view on your question and happy to follow-up as needed later.
Julian Mitchell: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Ritchie: So Neil, you mentioned the headwinds in Sunquest continuing into 2020. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on whether – what kind of impact it's going to have 2020? And specifically, whether – what you're doing to mitigate some of that within Sunquest?
Neil Hunn: Yes. So the headwind is the same headwind the business has experienced for quite some time. It's – it is, unfortunately, like slow motion and tectonically playing out because our customers, when they make a decision to leave three years ago. It takes them three years to leave. And so there's no new information. It's just taking this time to play out. The mitigating fact is we've decided, is we continue to invest in the products of this business, right. So we've invested in internationalization of the product. We are investing in the molecular genetic capabilities. We're investing in the integration of the fluid tissue and genetic molecular labs, and that continues and will continue. And so it's – we just have to let this one competitive headwind play itself out of the course of the next year.
Joe Ritchie: Okay. Got it. And then just a real quick one. On ComputerEase and iPipeline, the growth expected for 2020, is it supposed to be similar to the organic growth for the rest of the segment?
Neil Hunn: Well, yes, I think when we announced iPipeline, we felt really good about that being a high single-digit organic grower and nothing has changed to our opinion on that.
Joe Ritchie: And ComputerEase?
Rob Crisci: Yes, that's a smaller add-on to Deltek. And it's probably mid single-digit organic grower or maybe better.
Joe Ritchie: Okay, thanks guys.
Neil Hunn: Thanks.
Operator: Next question will come from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
Jeff Sprague: Thanks and good morning. I promise, I will be brief. Just on TransCore, back to that. I just want to understand how the cash flow actually works on the project. Would you expect to receive ratable cash flow because you're doing the work? Or would this be a very back-end loaded? And maybe even kind of a 2021 kind of cash event for the business?
Neil Hunn: That sounds like the same questions we asked our management team during this project run out. So we do feel that – we do feel the cash flows to be pretty well aligned with our earnings on the project. We've worked hard with that. We have a great partner that's working with us to make sure that, that happens. And so we do feel good about the cash coming in sort of in line with the EBITDA. Now certainly, you could see some payments in 2021 after the project is ended. So we'll see what happens but we're working hard to make sure the cash comes in on time.
Jeff Sprague: And just on Neptune, is there anything programmatic going on in 2020? Big localities or anything that's driving the business? Or it's just kind of more steady as she goes kind of penetration push?
Neil Hunn: Steady as she goes. Neptune's strategy has been actually focused on the medium and smaller municipalities. That's what their strength has been and will continue to be.
Jeff Sprague: Great, thank you.
Neil Hunn: You’re welcome.
Operator: Our next question will come from Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Yes, good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Joe.
Rob Crisci: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Giordano: So just on TransCore, what's the risk that, that deal leads into 2021 that the deployment actually takes longer or it gets started late?
Rob Crisci: It's already started.
Neil Hunn: It's already started. Yes. So the – it's a big project. It's got some complexity associated with it. So it certainly has a possibility of some of that bleeds into 2021. That said, let me be very clear, our customer has told us the infrastructure needs to be ready by December 31, 2020. And that's the project plan. That's the resources that are being deployed because that will then, in turn, enable the MTA to decide when and how they want to introduce the tolling. So our part of the project is to be completed by the end of the year per our customers' demand.
Joe Giordano: Okay, fair enough. And then how should we think about – absent forward M&A that I'm sure you'll do, but if we just strip that out, how do we think about the forward margin opportunity in the application network? Like how much of a drag on margins are the current new – relatively new business in there? And just how should we think about the floor opportunity to expand from already pretty high levels? 
Rob Crisci: Yes. So I wouldn't view the new businesses as a drag at all. I mean, they're all generally in line with the margins – EBITDA margins, right. Yes. I'm always speaking in terms of EBITDA margins and Shannon is correcting me – sometimes correcting me that the analyst think in terms of OP a lot of times. But from an EBITDA margin perspective, very consistent and there's no reason why they should go backwards. As Neil mentioned, I mean, we're always spending a lot in R&D. We're growing R&D, and you – and it's easy to do that when you have businesses that come in at a high contribution margins. There's plenty of dollars to invest in R&D and talent and people and everything, and that's really how these businesses grow. So we're continuing to do that. So I wouldn't see any sort of a margin headwind for these businesses any time into the future.
Joe Giordano: How should we think about them expanding? Like just normal kind of just capturing an incremental on the growth? Is there like…
Rob Crisci: Yes. It's incremental on the growth, right. I mean, when you have EBITDA margins in that 40% range, that's a very healthy software business that continually invests to grow. So I think that if it expands, great, but it's really about growing more at current margins.
Joe Giordano: Yes, fair enough. Thanks guys.
Rob Crisci: Yes.
Operator: And your next question will come from Robert McCarthy with Stephens.
Robert McCarthy: My questions have been answered. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: You’re welcome.
Operator: And your next question will come from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan.
Steve Tusa: Hey guys. Sorry, just a quick follow-up. Anything moving around on like cash conversion? I know that with the TransCore deal coming through, maybe it's a bit of a different cash profile early on. Anything – any dynamics there we have to be aware of for cash conversion or cash margin in 2020?
Rob Crisci: Yes. No. Thanks, Steve, for the question. I was preparing for it. I'm glad you got back on and asked. Yes. No, we definitely feel free cash flow….
Steve Tusa: Somebody pinged me to add – just want me to ask about this – usually a follow up but here we go.
Rob Crisci: You saved the day. Yes. No, I think if you look at our overall guide, free cash flow should grow double digits based on our guide in 2020. And then, obviously, as we do acquisitions, that should be further accretive to that. So that's sort of how we see it as of today. So no, there's no headwinds on cash flow.
Steve Tusa: I guess, your free cash flow this year grew a little bit less than that. What is the – is there anything unique kind of year-to-year that drives an acceleration of that?
Rob Crisci: Yes. So what balances around, right, so if you're looking at conversion to adjusted net earnings, what balances around the most is tax payments and cash tax versus GAAP tax. And so that's been a headwind the last couple of years with a lot more cash tax payments. And also, as I mentioned in the pre – in the scripted comments around TransCore, it didn't have a very good cash year around some projects last year, and then some of the product businesses weren't great. So I think as we sit – from a working capital standpoint, I think that we've got some additional room to improve. And so then that will be beneficial to cash flow next year and beyond. Everything else is very structural from a high cash conversion standpoint.
Steve Tusa: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Rob Crisci: Thank you.
Operator: And that will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to management for closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: That does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-24 08:00:00) =====
Operator: The Roper Technologies Third Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. And now I would like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning. And thank you all for joining us as we discuss the third quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.  Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.  Now if you'll please turn the Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to acquire deferred revenue; transaction related expenses for our completed acquisitions and the announced divestiture of Gatan; and lastly, tax expense adjustments related to our divestitures.  And now if you please turn to Slide 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. As usual, we'll start with our third quarter highlights. I'll then turn the call over to Rob to discuss our financial results. Then I'll walk us through the segment details and outlook, followed by our Q4 and remaining 2019 guidance. I'll then wrap up our prepared comments with a summary of our third quarter activities and share some of our early thoughts for 2020, then we'll open it up for Q&A.  Next slide please. We had another really strong quarter here at Roper. Revenue grew to $1.36 billion, margin execution was tremendous, really fantastic, and free cash flow came in at $387 million or 29% of revenue in the quarter. Gross margins expanded 80 basis points in the quarter broadly across the enterprise. And we always like to see the leverage down the P&L with organic revenue plus 2%, EBITDA up 5% and DEPS growing 6%. We saw broad-based growth across our software businesses in both our Application and Network segments. Our medical product franchises remains very strong as well as RF product businesses. Neptune had a nice quarter coming off strong double-digit comp from a year ago. But we did experience some short-term supply chain capacity constraints, which we will double-click into later in this call. Our Process Technologies segment continue to do a really impressive job of executing through the expected decline in oil and gas markets with tremendous margin improvements in the quarter. Also, we announced and closed two acquisitions, iPipeline and ComputerEase for a total of approximately $1.8 billion. Our capital deployment capability continues to operate at a high level. We'll talk much more about these acquisitions later in the call.  Further, we successfully executed a $1.2 billion very attractive bond offering in the quarter and we also agreed to the divest Gatan to AMETEK for $925 million, which is a great outcome for Roper and our shareholders.  Finally, as we look towards 2020 we are encouraged by many factors, not the least of which is TransCore's recent contract award to deploy and maintain New York City's congestion pricing tolling initiative. At the end of the call we will further unpack some of our views for 2020.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO to walk you through our consolidated quarterly results. Rob?
Rob Crisci: Thanks Neil, good morning, everyone. Turning to the next slide on the Q3 income statement metrics, go over some of the numbers for the quarter. Revenue was $1.358 billion, which was a 3% increase over prior year, organic plus 2%. That organic growth was led by our two segments that are primarily software -- our Application Software segment at plus 5% organic and our Network Software & Systems at plus 4% organic growth.  Margins, as Neil mentioned, were really spectacular, great execution by our business leadership teams across the enterprise. We had gross margin up 80 basis points to 64.6%, EBITDA margin up 90 basis points to 36.7%, the EBITDA for the quarter of $498 million, which was 5% growth. We benefited a little bit in the quarter as we looked down to the DEPS line from some favorable timing of perpetual license wins where we recognized I would say a few cents of earning in the quarter in Q3 that we had expected originally in Q4 around timing of those wins, primarily at Aderant and Deltek. And that gave us at the bottom-line DEPS of $3.29, which was well above our guidance range of $3.16 to $3.20.  Next slide.  Next slide our asset light business model, always one of our favorite slides. As many of you know, the big part of the Roper governance model is our focus on the balance sheet, working capital efficiency. As part of our annual review process we will be meeting with every business over the next couple of months as we look forward to the next three years. Of course, the number one focus on that is going to be around our long-term growth opportunities and strategic deployment for all the businesses and we will also spend some time focusing on do we have the right business model, are we doing a great job in terms of collecting our receivables and managing our working capital, so we can continue to compound our cash flow.  And if you look at the numbers on the slide, once again, great performance, negative working capital, minus 3.1% for the enterprise. Inventory 4.4%, down quite a bit over six years ago, receivables better than six years ago. And then of course, the big increase in deferred revenue as we've moved more and more towards high recurring revenue model across the enterprise and the deferred revenue of 13.5% is definitely excellent. We expect that number to only continue to rise moving forward.  Next slide. On to compounding cash flow. So again consistent strong cash flow conversion for the company. Operating cash flow of $404 million in the quarter represents 30% of revenue, free cash flow of $387 million representing 29% of revenue and a 78% conversion of free cash flow to EBITDA. If you look at our TTM free cash flow, very nice double-digit growth at 12% versus prior year. And if you look to the right to the bars we had a 15% CAGR on TTM free cash flow over the past few years. So again, consistent cash flow compounding at Roper, which we certainly expect to continue.  Next slide.  So turning to the next slide on our strong financial position. Soon after we were successful in the iPipeline process in August, we saw what was happening with the overall rate environment. And one of our principles around the balance sheet is to always be opportunistic if we can lock in what we view as good long-term rates. So we went ahead and were able to access the bond market in August, right before the summer slowdown. It was really an excellent job by the full Roper team and all of our advisors to get ready and hit the market and have a really successful outcome. So we were able to do a $1.2 billion bond offering, split between $500 million of five-year notes at 2.35% and $700 million of 10-year notes at 2.95%. At the time, I believe it was the lowest year-to-date coupon for any company at our rating levels. So really a great execution by the broader team.  Furthermore, the Gatan divestiture as Neil mentioned, we expect to close later this month, that will further enhance our ability to deploy capital. We ended the Q3 right around 3.0 times gross debt to EBITDA and then when we add in the expected $700 million or so proceeds from Gatan we will be well under 3 times. And as you know every month we generate a high level of cash that goes first and foremost to pay down our revolver when there is a balance. And so we always have ample of ability to deploy capital and we will end the quarter here in really a great position to continue deploying capital moving forward and taking advantage of our high quality pipeline of acquisition opportunities.  So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil.
Neil Hunn: Thanks Rob. Let's turn to our Application Software segment. Revenue came in at $405 million, which represented increase of 5% on an organic basis. EBITDA was $168 million, an increase of 7% versus prior year and EBITDA margins were 41.4%. At Deltek we saw the continuation of a few trends that we discussed over the past several quarters. Specifically Deltek grew high single-digits in the quarter following the difficult 2Q comp. In addition, we continue to see a good balance of perpetual software transactions and a continued acceleration in recurring revenues as a result of an increased mix of business towards Deltek SaaS offerings.  Also the business continued to see a nice bounce of activity across their two macro end markets, professional services and government contracting. Deltek’s team continues to execute exceptionally well. Also in the quarter, we acquired ComputerEase for a $185 million. ComputerEase is a leading enterprise software solution provider for construction firms with particular emphasis on the smaller end of the market. They have over 6,000 customers in North America and deliver the software on -- either on on-premise basis or in the cloud. This solution is very specific to the needs of building contractors including job costing, construction accounting, project management, asset management as well as payroll. This business fits nicely with Deltek's leadership position and the architecture and engineering vertical. This is a great addition to Delkek's AEC platform.  Aderant experienced yet again double-digit growth as a result of continued share gains within the large law vertical and the adoption of their newer SaaS solutions targeting smaller law firms and cross-selling new products to the larger firms. As you may know, we have highlighted Aderant’s competitive strength for several past quarters and are proud of the long-term market share gains by the Aderant team.  Strata logged another great quarter based on very strong new logo ads, continued strong renewal activity and the adoption of their new bolt-on products for their cost accounting and decision support SaaS products targeted to the hospital market. Data Innovations and CliniSys performed quite well in the quarter, each up high single-digits. Data Innovations, our global clinical laboratory middleware or connectivity software business continued nice share gains for their core connectivity products. And CliniSys, our European hospital laboratory ERP business continues to benefit from market consolidation in most of the Western European markets. In particular, CliniSys products are essentially the only hospital laboratory ERP products proven to scale to meet the needs of the larger consolidated customers. We're quite bullish that this trend will continue for many years to come.  And before we turn to the outlook, CBORD did very well in the quarter on increases in their recurring subscription revenues. Of importance, we announced a partnership with Apple whereby the students’ and the faculty’s security and payments credentials can be on-boarded into the Apple Wallet. Six universities Clemson, University of San Francisco, University of Tennessee Knoxville, University of Vermont, MIT, and University in Kentucky have or are adopting this technology for this full year. For CBORD, this opens up a new recurring revenue stream as each credential is activated. Though very early, this could prove to be a nice long-term growth driver for CBORD. And finally, and we have to highlight the tremendous, just excellent cash performance in the quarter from CBORD. Great job and congrats to Jim, Rob and the entire team there.  As we turn to the outlook, we want to highlight that Deltek and Aderant were benefited by the acceleration of a few high margin perpetual transactions. These transactions were in the sales funnel at the end of last quarter but the timing of which is always difficult to pinpoint. So we assumed they were closed in Q4. But they were executed in Q3. Notwithstanding, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic increases for this segment in Q4.  Next slide, please. Turning to our Network segment, revenue in our Network Software & Systems segment for the quarter were $394 million, an increase of 4% on an organic basis. EBITDA was $176 million increasing 15% versus the prior year, and EBITDA margins were 44.7%. During the quarter, we acquired iPipeline for $1.625 billion. iPipeline, we’ll report it in this segment, and we'll discuss iPipeline in detail on the following slide.  The quarter was highlighted by continued growth in our DAT or North American freight match business. In particular, we saw strength in demand for a rate data offering which helped drive increased ARPU in the quarter. Foundry also started strong with double-digit revenue growth in their first full quarter as part of Roper. In particular, there was nice growth across both their media and entertainment core vertical, and their emerging digital design business. Also in the quarter, Jody and the team delivered major releases to both their Nuke and Katana product offering. iTrade grew double-digits in the quarter based on strong renewal activity and new customer adds. MHA’s performance in the quarter was highlighted by several strong trends. To remind everyone, MHA is the largest group purchasing network for the non-hospital market with leadership positions and long-term care pharmacies, long-term care facilities and home infusion marketplaces. The team continues to win the market share gain relative to on-boarding new and startup pharmacies. Importantly, in the quarter, MHA continued to see the benefits of increased customer purchasing volumes due to several new pharmaceutical products being on contract.  Also, it's worth reminding everyone about the favorable end market conditions, essentially the aging of America and the increasing demands this aging demographic puts on the healthcare system. This trend benefits MHA.  Finally, the President of MHA, Mike Sicilian announced his intention to retire from the business. Mike has been the MHA President since our acquisition in 2013 and has done a terrific job growing MHA and providing leadership to both SoftWriters and SHP. Congrats to Mike for a wonderful career with MHA and Roper. And Mike, thank you. His successor Diane Koontz has been MHA's COO for the GPO business for several years. As a result, MHA's leadership succession plan has been seamless, which is a testament to Mike and Diane working together in pursuit of this transition for several quarters. Turning to RF IDeas, we continue to see strength in this business. In fact, another record quarter for RF IDeas. The strength was based on continued adoption of RF Ideas’ core reader technology in secure print and secure sign on applications. This is another very good example of a leadership niche business and in this case Roper style products business. Great job by the team.  And finally, in the quarter TransCore was down low single-digits based on project timing. Importantly TransCore was recently awarded with the design, implementation and maintenance contract for New York City’s Central Business District Tolling Program. The total contract value was approximately $507 million and we expect to recognize approximately $200 million of revenue associated with this contract next year. The recurring revenue operations and maintenance portion of the contract will commence in early 2021 and run for a minimum of six years. Thank you to the MTA for trusting TransCore to deliver on this very important and highly visible contract. And also congratulations to Tracy and the entire TransCore team for building the products and technologies needed to implement this project as well as the many years of experience integrating similar solutions. As we return to the outlook, we continue to expect mid single-digit organic growth for this segment in the final quarter of the year. Next slide please. iPipeline is a wonderful addition to our growing stable of software businesses. iPipeline is a leader in cloud-based software solutions for the life insurance industry. Specifically, iPipeline provides the necessary workflow automation solutions needed to quote, apply, underwrite and manage life insurance products. The software solutions enable very broad network of carriers, distributors and agents in the sales and delivery of life insurance products. The purchase price was $1.625 billion and is immediately cash accretive. We expect the business to grow in the high single-digit range and this is based on the company's long history of revenue, EBITDA and cash flow growth.  For 2020, we expect iPipeline to deliver approximately $200 million in revenue at roughly 40% EBITDA margins and generate approximately $70 million of after-tax unlevered free cash flow. Importantly, iPipeline is a Roper style software business. They have very strong cash flow characteristics and is very asset light, in fact negative net working capital. The management teams led by Larry Berran exemplify what we look for in our leaders. Long-term commitment to solving customer problems with solutions that have recurring revenue streams, teams that love to build great businesses. They are the clear leader in this niche vertical and as a result have very deep domain knowledge. And given this, they have very high levels of recurring revenue and their customer intimacy provides clear opportunities to continually enhance the products and solutions to continue to grow over the long-term. We've been tracking this business for several years and are excited to welcome the team to Roper.  Next slide please. Revenue in the quarter in our Measurement & Analytic Solutions segment were $389 million, a decrease of 2% on an organic basis. EBITDA was $137 million, a decrease of 6% versus the prior year and EBITDA margins were 34.4%. Verathon had a strong quarter whose growth was led by increases in their GlideScope consumables recurring revenue. In addition, the Verathon team has done a nice job launching their new single use bronchoscope product line, well on path to becoming a meaningful product for Verathon within the first year of launch.  NDI had another great quarter. This quarter’s strength was rooted in NDI’s electromagnetic and optical measurement systems used by several OEMs in surgical applications. Great job again by the NDI team. Our CIVCO MMI business in Iowa City had a very nice quarter that was highlighted by strong execution in their ultrasound guidance market. Neptune did well in the quarter especially coming off a strong double-digit comp from a year ago, but the quarter's growth was hampered by supply chain constraints specific to their newer ultrasonic residential meter offering. Of note, over the past couple of years Neptune has invested to develop a static meter based on ultrasound technology for both the residential and larger commercial and industrial meter markets.  In the quarter Neptune saw bookings for ultrasonic meters outstripped their current production capacity, which we view as generally a good thing as this newer product appears to be striking a positive chord with several new customers. The Neptune operating and supply chain teams are working aggressively to boost production, which we expect to see the benefit of as we head into 2020. All-in-all, a good quarter for Neptune.  As we expected our short cycle industrial businesses declined high single-digits. This performance was consistent with the last part of last quarter and consistent with our expectations heading into Q3. The business has started taking cost actions in Q3 and will continue into Q4 to best position these businesses for 2020. Importantly, this group did a tremendous job managing margins in the quarter. As we have discussed, we reached an agreement to sell Gatan to AMETEK for $925 million. We expect the sale to close at the end of this month.  Given the backdrop of a two-year sales process and a very intensive divestiture workload over the last three to four months, the Gatan business had a challenging third quarter down high single-digits as volume shifted out of Q3 and into Q4. We expect most of these delayed shipments to occur after the closing of the divestiture.  As we turn to our guidance, we see organic revenues flat for the fourth quarter. We see our medical product business is growing mid single-digit plus for the final quarter of the year. We expect Neptune to grow low single-digits as they are working to expand their static meter supply chain capacity and we expect our short cycle industrial businesses to be down high single-digits. Finally, as we mentioned before, we expect the divestiture of Gatan to close later in this month. Of note, Gatan's annual EBITDA has historically been extremely back-end weighted through the last two months of the year, a period we do not expect to own in 2019.  Next slide please.  And finally revenue for our Process Technologies segment for the quarter were $160 million, a decrease of 5% on an organic basis. EBITDA was $58 million, a decrease of 3% versus prior year and EBITDA margins were 36.6%, an increase of 100 basis points. We saw very strong actually outstanding margin performance for this group of businesses in the quarter. This was driven by our business unit leadership teams executing to remove cost from the businesses on a rapid basis. To this end and it's always worth reminding everyone the vast majority of our businesses’ cost structure are variable. For this reason when times are good we tend to only have modest incrementally positive leverage, but this meaningfully benefits us when times get more challenging. We are able to quickly take cost out of the system and position the businesses in the most optimal manner. The teams did a great job of this in the quarter.  Relative to CCC we continue to see strength in their LNG project pipeline and we are the contracted vendor in essentially all new projects coming online over the next several years.  Finally and prior to turning to our guidance, we are excited to announce new presidents at both our PAC and CCC businesses. Both businesses have and continue to perform well, but the addition of Ed and Pete to our team should greatly enhance these two businesses’ ability to develop and deploy strategy, drive targeted operational improvements, and simplify the operational complexity of each of these businesses. Welcome to both Ed and Pete to the Roper family.  Turning to our outlook, we do see and expect a weakened outlook for upstream oil and gas businesses as we head into Q4. Given this we are guiding to mid single-digit organic revenue declines in this segment for Q4.  Next slide please. Core guidance, we are tightening our DEPS guidance to a range of $12.98 to $13.02 compared to our prior guidance of $12.94 to $13.06. Also for establishing Q4 adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.32 to $3.36. Please note that Q4 and the full year guidance includes an $0.08 headwind based on the net impact of our Q3 acquisitions and the Q4 divestiture of Gatan. Finally we expect our tax rate to be approximately 22% in the quarter.  Next slide please. As we turn to our final slide before Q&A. We continue to see strength in our niche market strategy and governance model that promotes nimble local execution. This led to strong performance in the quarter across the enterprise. EBITDA margins were up 90 basis points to 36.7%. DEPS grew 6% to $3.29 and TTM free cash flow increased by 12%. Also and importantly, we successfully deployed $1.8 billion for two terrific Roper like software businesses in the quarter, ComputerEase and iPipeline.  Finally in the quarter we were able to reach an agreement with AMETEK to divest Gatan for $925 million and complete a $1.2 billion bond offering is a very attractive long-term rate. Great execution across the entire enterprise in the quarter.  As we look towards 2020, we see several encouraging trends. First, our enterprise continues to be less and less exposed to macro cyclical impacts as our expanding software portfolio increases our recurring revenue mix. This is a longer-term trend that we feel great about.  Next, our balance sheet remains very strong and will only be strengthened by the Gatan divestiture proceeds. Further, our acquisition pipeline remains very strong with several high quality opportunities across various stages of deal maturity. We continue to see a very large number of very high quality assets.  And finally, TransCore's New York City congestion pricing infrastructure project will drive meaningful revenue, approximately $200 million for the enterprise, beginning in 2020.  Now as we turn to questions we want to remind everyone that what we do is very simple. We compound cash flow by running a portfolio of operating businesses that have market-leading positions and niche industry. We provide the business leaders with Socratic coaching about what great looks like relative strategy, operations, innovation and talent development. We incent our management teams based on growth. We have a culture of mutual trust and transparency. And finally, we take our excess free cash flow and deploy it to buy businesses that have better cash returns than our existing company. These simple ideas deliver powerful results.  Now, let's turn the call over to your questions. 
Operator: Thank you. We will now go to the question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]. We will begin with Deane Dray, RBC Capital Markets. 
Deane Dray : Hey maybe you can just start with some clarification on the perpetual license revenues that came in for Deltek and Aderant. Just give us some context here. Is this the customer deciding when these will be executed and are they one-time? And I think Rob said that it pulled maybe $0.02 out of what would have been in the fourth quarter and the third quarter, is that right? 
Rob Crisci : Yes, it was probably closer to $0.03, maybe $0.04. It's just timing those things come in at really 100% margin. And so what, go ahead, you can talk about the customers. 
Neil Hunn : Yes, I mean, the situation for both Aderant and Deltek, these were larger -- on the larger side of transactions. They were pretty late stage in the pipeline as we're preparing our guidance for this coming quarter, but you never know on the timing of these larger deals. And so we'll tend to take a more conservative posture on the timing and they just came in a little bit earlier than we thought. 
Deane Dray : Got it. And then on the congestion tolling win. So, congratulations on that, everyone has been watching this as the contract and where the first major city in the U.S. will take on this technology. So you already have Stockholm, you already have London. Are there other U.S. cities that you are in negotiations with and do you have the capacity to roll out more of these systems? 
Neil Hunn : I think there is -- if you Google congestion pricing you see almost every large U.S. city sort of thinking about it or talking about it or in some stage or in the legislation to begin. But that said, all eyes are watching this implementation, not just how TransCore does, but how the initiative works for the city. How the funding works? How it goes? So I think the funding here is going to underlie our support of $15 billion bond offerings which is part of a $50 billion capital plan for MTA. And so the whole picture is being watched, but we're certainly encouraged this could be a very long-term opportunity to do other cities for us. 
Deane Dray : Got it. And then just last one from me. Just can you clarify on Neptune and this high quality problem of demand on your ultrasonic smart meters? Are you losing any business or any customers getting turned away because you can't supply them over the near-term or is this going into backlog? 
Neil Hunn : It's 100% going into backlog. In fact the majority of these wins came from competitive displacements of ultrasonic technology that was not working as well as our product does. And so it's in backlog, it was -- this is not a sort of a customer surprise per se. It was just a little bit of push out in terms of capacity on our side. But it's not -- it's all positive from our point of view. 
Operator: And Robert McCarthy with Stephens has the next question. 
Robert McCarthy: Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on a great quarter. A lot of really good things to talk about. But I think rather than talk about the good things I'll be more of the fox and hedgehog. The Gatan divestiture, I think you guys were in print about a year ago when you announced the sale to Thermo about $150 million in sales. And then I think the most recent press release suggested $180 million, but now I think you cited for the full year expectation of some disappointment there. So, what is the updated expectation for 2019 revenues for Gatan in the context of what you've already disclosed? 
Rob Crisci : Right. So, yes, the full year numbers are the numbers that were disclosed I think when the announcement was made. So, I mean, there is no update at all to that. 
Robert McCarthy : Okay, alright. Fair enough. I guess I'll take care of that offline. In a more positive light, obviously longer tune on Neptune, I would say the following. In attending some industry conferences recently around the smart grid in general and grid automation in general across a variety, whether it would be electricity, water et cetera, with the utilities. There seems to be kind of a rising wave that the canopy of the Internet of things and data is really going to be a nice secular growth story here. And it could be the bleeding edge of IoT over the near term. Are you seeing from what you're seeing in Neptune's markets and the software opportunities there even from a capital deployment perspective? Are you seeing a sea change in that market? Is that becoming more attractive to you than perhaps history would suggest? Any color there in terms of what the secular organic dynamics are with respect to that general vertical? 
Neil Hunn : Yes. So, our experience with in this water industry, I don't think -- there's no sea change. It's sort of tectonically changing. It's slow and paced and conservative. That said, for many years. At least three or four that I can think going through the Neptune strategic plans. They have focused a number of resources on what they call network-as-a-service and then also the data that comes out of the water meter to be able to do more leak detection and more reporting to the customers on sort of their utilization patterns et cetera. So, it is certainly attractive. Neptune opened an R&D center and a software development center in the Atlanta market, the sort of how some of these resources. That said, it is a small part of Neptune today. I mean Neptune is the leader and will continue to be the leader both on the mechanical meters and emerging on the sort of static ultrasonic meters. And as you know, the technology that we place on top of the meter has been a long-term differentiated advantage for us as you don't have to touch the meter as the reading technology changes from sort of mobile to fixed. So, that's our views on there and happy to spend more time on that, if you like. 
Operator: Now we'll take a question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. 
Christopher Glynn : Curious with the -- on the heels of the efficient reprocessing of the Gatan transaction, just wondering how you're viewing the market overall for strategic buyers of manufacturing assets and your kind of view of that whole dynamic around your portfolio mix? 
Neil Hunn : I don't know if that's a trick question, but we -- the businesses that we have that are on the product side are great businesses. They've been in the portfolio for a long-time. They're amazing cast producers that enable sort of our -- meaningfully enable our capital deployment strategy. We talked in this quarter how the cost structures are positioned to be on a variable basis to best sort of let us sort of right up and down as the macro market rides them. And so they are in the portfolio. We like them in the portfolio and expect them to stay in the portfolio. 
Christopher Glynn : And I don't know if this is a hedgehog question or not, but I didn't hear anything on PowerPlan, just wondering how that's tracking financially and culturally. I think you've had it for about a year now? 
Neil Hunn : Yes culturally it's great. Joe, who is the leader of that business has done a great job with the culture and sort of getting on the right growth sort of drivers and footing. We talked about a couple of times in the past. Well around the time we acquired the business, we were just on the back end of a sort of an industry-wide adoption of lease accounting software to which PowerPlan was one of many benefactors of. On the back side of that we had to -- had in our currently finishing retooling the go-to-market capability to go back to the old school way of identifying leads or working leads and closing leads. So, we saw a great momentum in that last quarter in terms of adds to the pipeline. We saw that continue this quarter, but more importantly the pipeline adds or added last quarter matured and got closer in the later stages of the sales funnel. So, they've done a really nice job retooling the go-to market. We feel good about the business as we head into next year. 
Operator: Next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. 
Unidentified Analyst : This is [Joe] on for Julian. Just starting with kind of a broader question on your SaaS businesses. As they become a larger part of the portfolio, how are you guys thinking about the longer -- medium term trends of your kind of average revenue per user. You mentioned that Aderant was benefiting this quarter from cross-selling and then things like that. Do you think that's something that's going to be able to have in other SaaS businesses? And then I guess just as a part two there. Are you offering any incentives to your customers to switch over into the SaaS products, I guess at Deltek in particular? And then does that kind of imply a tailwind can come in when those incentives go away a little further down the line? 
Neil Hunn : Alright. Hey, there's a lot in there. So, I'll try to sort of take it one by one. So, it's hard for us to make out a comprehensive or broad-based sort of statement across the many SaaS businesses that we have or businesses that are selling their products on a subscription basis around the cross-selling up-selling, but it is -- that said for each one, it is a very meaningful part of their strategy, right, where just take the most recent one iPipeline. They've got gross retention in the high 90s and net retention like 110. So, a big part of their strategy is cross-selling and up-selling additional products to the existing customer base. As I'm sure you're aware, I mean the heaviest cost in a SaaS business is the cost to acquire a customer. And so then we want to see the solution sort of stack on top of that over a long period of time. So, we're certainly -- that is certainly the strategy of each one of our businesses. But if that's a generalized statement, it’s hard to give you a specific one because each business -- its deployment against that is unique to that business. Relative to your question on incentives, certainly not from a financial point of view, I mean there is a very compelling value proposition for a customer to migrate their implementation from on-premise to the cloud, not the least of which is the headaches of managing the technology, infrastructure moves to us, to the users of the software. Perhaps the largest benefit of the value proposition is, they get the benefit of all the new releases when the new releases are released, which oftentimes and almost most cases is not the case when it's hosted by the customer and the list goes on, but they are not financial incentives to sort of migrate to the cloud. And again maybe the final thing I would say is, this is -- there is no push from us to mandate X percent of revenue gets into the cloud by Y date. This is very much company by company and that company is being pulled by their customers to go into the cloud. And as a result, the businesses are at various stages of maturity. 
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you. And then just a follow-up. How are you guys seeing kind of the commercial construction market right now and how that will impact Deltek and other offerings? 
Neil Hunn : Yes. So, it’s -- the company we have most index -- commercial construction in the U.S. is our construct connect business. The principal business they are in is, is they have virtually every commercial development project in the U.S. They have visibility to that project in the planning phase from many years out when they were just doing the permittings to right before shovel goes in the ground. And so that set of leads if you will or projects becomes more and more valuable to the contractors as the economy gets weaker and weaker. And so it somewhat has a sort of a counter-cyclical sort of demand associated with that.  So, feel pretty good on the Deltek side with our recent acquisition, ComputerEase on the small end of the contractor side and sort of automating their businesses. Same thing when times get a little bit more tough than the customers look for more efficiencies in the software that we just bought sort of enables that. 
Operator: Moving to a question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. 
Steve Tusa : So, you guys didn't give a total company organic revenue update for the year, for guidance. I think it was 4% the last quarter. What's that going to be now? 
Neil Hunn : Yes. So, we gave each of the segments. I think if you add up all the segments for the fourth quarter, it's going to be pretty close to the Q3 organic, so in the 2% range. So, I think if you add that up for the full year, we're somewhere just north of 3%. 
Steve Tusa : And then with regards to Gatan, I think they said something like $70 million in EBITDA, I'm not sure how much D&A goes with that. But what is the kind of dilution for next year from that deal? 
Rob Crisci : Yes. So, our best estimate would be $45 million to $50 million of EBITDA would go away. That was in '19 obviously, wouldn't have in 2020. As Neil mentioned, it really is very consistent that their last quarter is their biggest quarter as I'm sure you know from covering us for a long period of time and actually November, December is 35% to 40% of our annual EBITDA typically. So, that's our best guess is sort of what numbers we'll get that we won't get next year. 
Steve Tusa : Do you know what the difference is between the $70 million and the $50 million that they're talking about $70 million? What's the difference between that and your $50 million? 
Rob Crisci : November and December. 
Q - Steve Tusa : Okay, got it. So, it's the calendar issue. Got it. 
Rob Crisci : Right. We are assuming it gets sold this month. 
Steve Tusa : Okay. And then one last one, I mean, acknowledging the pipeline looks good at PowerPlan. What is actually -- what was actually the growth of that business in the quarter? 
Rob Crisci : PowerPlan, the quarter was down a little bit over past -- over last year. 
Neil Hunn : Steve which is we expected given we are rebuilding the pipeline there. 
Steve Tusa : Yes. And what is it year-to-date? 
Rob Crisci : Year-to-date, it's down slightly year-to-date. 
Operator: We'll now move to a question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. And Joe you may be muted please unmute. There's no response from that line. We'll move to the next question. And that will come from Joe Giordano with Cowen. 
Robert Jamieson : Hey, good morning. This is Robert in for Joe this morning. I just have a follow-up to Deane's question on the New York City order in TransCore. Can you give us a little bit of color on what the margin profile is there and how that changes throughout the contract? 
Neil Hunn : Yes, it's just pretty simple, right. So, it's a little north of $500 million contract. About half of that is the design and implementation. The remaining half is six years worth of maintenance operations. It's consistent with TransCore's margin structure, which is a little bit below that of Roper on a consolidated basis. 
Robert Jamieson : Okay, thank you. 
Neil Hunn : And project profile -- sorry the margin profile is pretty consistent across the totality of the period. 
Robert Jamieson : Okay, perfect. That helps. And then just another one without giving any names, are there any businesses within your portfolio that you're looking at or that makes sense to divest in the next year or so? 
Neil Hunn : Certainly, if there were, we couldn't talk about it. So, we can't talk about it. 
Operator: Now we'll take a question from Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management. 
Alex Blanton : Just wanted to clarify what you said about the margins in the New York City business, you say was slightly below the average for the company? 
Neil Hunn : Yes. 
Alex Blanton : I wanted to go to, what you said about CCC and the bridge there, project opportunities going forward. Could you repeat that? 
Neil Hunn : Sure. There are -- the exact number I don't have on my fingertip. A dozen or so larger LNG projects that are in the feed sort of in the planning phase, late stage of planning phase across the globe and were specified and I think 11 of the 12 and still have an opportunity in the 12th. And so we're -- the long-term sort of projects positioning you see what you've commented on that for several quarters is quite good. 
Alex Blanton : But what kind of revenue growth that we're talking about there, these compared with let's say the recent past? 
Neil Hunn : As you know these projects take many years to unfold. And so we're talking about just the very long-term, the next several years of CCC based on these projects, very long lead time projects appears to be quite robust, don't want to get into the comments of specific growth rates of specific companies many years down the road. 
Alex Blanton : When CCC was first acquired in 1992 they were doing almost entirely retrofits of existing projects because the compressor companies that were selling compressors to these projects were not using CCC software in the compressors that they were delivering initially to those projects. So, CCC would come along and just retrofit because the operators of those projects found that their search control and all of the rest were superior to what was being provided by the OEMs. It sounds as if that has completely changed. Is that correct? Now it's been adopted? 
Neil Hunn : I wouldn't say it's been completely changed. I mean the balance -- the business is balanced between new projects and retrofits. One of the strategies of the business -- in fact it probably tilted more towards new and a little bit lesser towards the retrofits in the past several years and the leadership team there has worked really hard to position CCC with the various customer opportunities across the globe to do more of getting larger percentage of market share of the retrofit opportunities to get more back in balance. And so we can fully endorse the strategy and look forward to execution against it. 
Alex Blanton: And finally is your principal competition in that business still the OEMs as it was? 
Neil Hunn : Sure. Yes. 
Operator: And that will end our question-and-answer session for the call. We will now go back to your host for closing remarks. 
Zack Moxcey: Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next call. 
Operator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-25 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to Roper Technologies Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. I'll remind you that today's call is being recorded. And now I'd like to turn the conference over to Zack Moxcey.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the second quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you'll please turn to slide two. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to slide three. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments to acquire deferred revenue, transaction related expenses for the foundry acquisition and lastly and adjustment to the income tax expense related to the gain on sale of our Scientific Imaging businesses. And now if you will please turn to Slide 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. As usual, we'll start with our second quarter highlights. I'll then turn our call over to Rob to discuss our financial results. I'll then walk us through the segment details and outlook, followed by our Q3 in 2019 guidance, then we'll open it up for Q&A. Next slide. We had another very strong quarter here at Roper. Revenue grew as expected, margin execution was strong and operating cash flow increased 13%. It was nice to see gross margins expand 90 basis points in the quarter increasing in both of our product segments. And we always like to see leverage down the P&L with EBITDA growing faster than revenue and cash flow outpacing that of EBITDA. Our software segments continued their strong momentum led by 6% organic growth and our network systems and software segment which saw broad based growth highlighted by DAT, iTrade, MHA and SoftWriters. Application software grew 2% despite a difficult comp against Deltek significant perpetual wins a year ago. Deltek continues to win in the marketplace with bookings up double-digits and SaaS adoption accelerating in the quarter. Growth in our Measurement & Analytical Solutions segment was led by high-single-digit growth in our medical product businesses as new products gain traction following recent investments. And Neptune strategic concepts continued with another solid quarter of growth. However, this was partially offset by expected decline to contain and a short cycle pause late in the quarter for industrial businesses, which represents approximately 8% of our annual revenues. We will discuss this later in the call, but we're maintaining a cautious stand and not assuming investment improvement in the second half of the year. Process technologies continues to do an impressive job executing through expected declines in oil and gas market. As many of you know, we closed the Foundry transaction in the quarter and onboarded the company into operating and governance model or very early things are off to a good start. And finally, our acquisition pipeline is quite active, and our balance sheet positions are exceptionally well to deploy capital in the second half. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO to walk you through our consolidated quarter results, Rob.
Rob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everybody. Turning to page six, I would like to recap some of the numbers behind our strong second quarter financial performance, starting with revenue, revenue was 1.332 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3% and organic increase of 2%. This was right online as Neil mentioned with our internal guidance model coming into the quarter. We had organic growth in three of the four segments, the one thing that was down was our process technology segment as expected against the very difficult plus 20% comp last year. Margin expansion was very strong, so gross margins increased 90 basis points to 64%, EBITDA increased 5%, EBITDA margin up 70 basis point. So, really good margin expansion for the quarter, probably a little bit better than we had anticipated coming in. So that all adds up to DEPS for the quarter of $3.07, which was a 6% increase over last year and a little bit better than our guidance coming in as $3 to $3.04. Next slide. Turning to asset-light business model slide. We will look here the net working capital as a percent of the Q2 annualized revenue, so slightly different view this quarter. Looking back over the past six years of the trend to give a little bit of a perspective and what's been going on with working capital here for Roper over a long period of time. So, if you look back and compare June 2013 quarter to the June 2019 quarter, you will see our inventory is down 200 basis points to 4.3% of revenue. Receivables are down 240 basis points to 17.3% of revenue, payables down a little bit to 10.5%, but deferred revenue up 680 basis points to 13.5% and if you add all that together you see this consistent negative working capital we talked about at Roper at minus 2.4% for the quarter and that over a thousand basis point improvement versus the same period in 2013. So, we really believe the negative net working capital accelerates our cash flow compounding. Next slide. Speaking of cash flow compounding, excellent cash results in the quarter on page eight, Q2 operating cash flow of 301 million now is at 30% increase versus prior year, the free cash flow was 286 million which represented a 14% increase versus prior year. So, if we look now at the trailing 12 month 1.51 billion, certainly a record plus 23% over prior year 12-month period and representing importantly 28% of revenue. If you look at the first half of the year, we are up 15% on cash flow that were certainly on pace for continued double-digit compounding at Roper. Next slide. So importantly, due to the strong cash flow performance, we really see exceptional deleveraging over the past year, so in between acquisitions, we generate a lot of cash, we paid our debt very, very quickly that we're always well-positioned to make the next acquisition and deploy capital. So, if you look at the past year, gross debt down $900 million from 5.6 billion down to 4.7 billion, Net debt is down 800 million from 5.2 billion to 4.4 billion. The TTM EBITDA is up $191 million and you can see year gross debt to EBITDA is now down to 2.5 times, net debt to EBITDA is was down 2.3 times. We recently were upgraded at Moody's which we're very happy to see, we also have a BBB plus rating at S&P. So, we really are exceptionally well-positioned as we sit here today to continue our disciplined capital deployment and really take advantage of the of the very high-quality pipeline and acquisition opportunities that we have in front of us. So, with that, I will turn it back over to Neil.
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Rob. Let's go and turn to our application software segment. In the quarter, the segment represented 29% of our revenue and revenues came in at 391 million, which was plus to organic and EBITDA was 155 million, which represented 39.7% margin. Starting with Deltek, we saw a continuation of a few trends that we've discussed over the past several quarters. First, we saw an acceleration in bookings and recurring revenues as a result of an increased mix of business towards Deltek SaaS offerings. In fact, in the quarter, Deltek signed their largest Vantagepoint's SaaS contract. As a reminder, Vantagepoint is Deltek's new enterprise software offering targeting professionals service firms. Also, the business continues to see a nice balance of activity across their two macro end markets, professional services and government contract. To remind you, Deltek had a very difficult comp given a very large volume of perpetual deal signed a year ago. Adjusting for this, Deltek grew their bookings double digits in the quarter. Deltek team continues to execute exceptionally well. Aderant experienced double-digit growth, as a result of continued share gains in the adoption of their newer staff solutions targeting law firm. As you may note, we've highlighted Aderant’s competitive strength over the last several quarters. Over that period of time and since 2015, Aderant has added approximately 40,000 timekeepers to their core platform, roughly 30,000 of which have been competitively won from their largest competitor, Deane and her team at Aderant have done and continue to do a great job. At PowerPlan, we saw nice increases in recurring revenues based on continued strong retention rates and an expanding customer base. Importantly, the PowerPlan team is working aggressively and systematically to increase the volume of new pipeline ads and their sales funnel. This is particularly important following the regulatory driven increase and license implementation revenues following the new lease accounting standards. Also, we saw nice increases again at CBORD with excellent cash performance. As a reminder, CBORD is our software business that delivers integrated security and payment solutions to higher education and health care campuses. Finally, Strata log another great quarter based on very strong renewal activity, the adoption of their new products and continued market share gains for their cost accounting and Decision Support SaaS products for hospital market. As we turn to the outlook for the second half, we continue to expect 4% to 6% organic increases for the segment. The comps for Deltek will normalize in the second half and we expect the segment's organic growth to be slightly better in Q4 versus that of Q3. Next slide. And turning to our Network System, Software & Systems segment. This segment in the quarter revenue represented 28% of Roper’s revenue and revenue was $368 million which was plus 6% on an organic basis. EBITDA was $159 million, which represented a margin of 43.2%. The quarter was highlighted by continued growth at both of our freight match businesses, the U.S. and Canadian markets. In particular, we saw strength and demand for our rates data offering. MHA’s performance in the quarter was highlighted by several strong trends. To remind everyone, MHA is the largest group purchasing network for the non-hospital market, with leadership position and long-term care of pharmacy, long-term care of facilities and home infusion marketplaces. The team continues to win the market share gain relative to on-boarding new and started pharmacies. So, nothing new here, and a good job by the go-to market team. Importantly in the quarter, MHA started to see the benefits of increased customer purchasing volumes due to several new pharmaceutical products being on contract. Also, pricing appears just stabilize and the businesses food and nutrition portfolio grew nicely into quarter in the mid-single-digit range. Additionally, our Pharmacy Automation and Workflow Software business, SoftWriters had a very nice quarter continuing a trend. This is an example of a wonderful software business with network effects and network financial benefits. This is a business that develops and deploys the core pharmacy automation workflow software that closed door or non-retail pharmacies use in their day-to-day operations. The economics of this business and for our customers are unlocked as they cross-sell the recurring revenue transactional products, specifically electronic claims submission and e-prescription. So, as this business adds more and more pharmacies to the customer accounts, their economic model expands at a more rapid pace as the recurring revenues accelerate. Nice job by the team in Pittsburgh. iTrade grew high single digits in the quarter based on strong renewal activity and an increase in trading partner growth. Over the last couple of years, the team at iTrade has worked to structure their business model and customer contracts or iTrade benefits from volume increases from their trading partners and we saw the benefits of this in the most recent quarter. Again, we saw strength at RF Ideas, in fact a record quarter for the business. The strength is based on continued adoption of RF Ideas core reader technology in the secure print and secure sign-on marketplaces. At TransCore, the quarter is marked by an exciting new product release. TransCore’s proprietary integrated toll technology and partnership with Gentex was released in rearview mirrors and Audi's new electric SUV. Currently other OEMs are evaluating the technology and considering timetable for a potential adoption, or very early this is another example of great innovation by Roper business. And before we return to the outlook for the segment, we wanted to briefly discuss our most recent acquisition, Foundry. We closed the transaction during the second quarter. Soon after, we had the opportunity to onboard the team and do our normal introduction to our governance model and CRI framework. Also, we're excited to announce that Jody Madden, previously Foundry’s Head of Product was named as our CEO. Jody is perfectly suited for this role, given her long history in the visual effects industry, as well as her specific history with Foundry. So far, it has been a very easy transition. Importantly, Jody was able to successfully close a couple of very large planned transactions with customer prospects in early days of our new leadership role. Congrats to Jody and welcome to the entire Foundry team. Now turning to our outlook. For the second half, we continue to see 4% to 6% organic growth for this segment. Role of TransCore, the new project pipeline remains robust, although it's difficult as usual to forecast the timing of new project wins and implementation timetable. Next slide. Our Measurement and Analytical Systems segment in the quarter represented 31% of Roper’s revenue. Revenue for the segment was $408 million which is plus 2% on an organic basis, and EBITDA came in at $140 million, which represented a 34.3% margin. Neptune had another record quarter. Neptune strategy is rooted in customer intimacy and product innovation continues to help Neptune systematically gain market share in the North American market. NDI had another great quarter. This quarter strength is rooted in NDI's electromagnetic and optical measurement systems used by several OEMs in surgical applications. Dave and his team in Waterloo continue to do a terrific job. Verathon Growth was led by increases in our glide scope consumables recurring revenue and demand for the next generation bladder scan systems. The Roper Board of Directors is looking forward to a site visit at Verathon during the upcoming September board meeting and seeing all the progress the company has made for the past couple years. Our CIVCO MMI our Multi-Modality Imaging business located in Iowa City had a very nice quarter that was highlighted by strong execution in their ultrasound guidance and infection control markets. CIVCO's ultrasound guidance products have extremely high levels of intellectual property and meaningfully aid doctors and ultrasound assisted procedures. Our particular interest is CIVCO's most recent innovation regarding infection control. For many years, CIVCO has been a market leader in providing covers for ultrasound assisted surgical procedures, namely image guided biopsies. One of the risk factors of these procedures is the risk of cross contamination of the gel that is used for ultrasound conductivity. Well, the smart team at CIVCO appears to have solved this problem. They created the first ever an IP protected solution that does not require gel in ultrasound guided procedures. The team is just launching the product in North American and Europe, and congrats to the team on its innovation. And we look forward to working with the team to make this become the standard of care. Our industrial businesses, which are about 25% of this segment’s revenues are impacted by a short cycle pause late in the quarter and down mid-single digits. Strewers [ph] really all of over industrial businesses from a slowdown in the second half of the quarter, due to project push outs and consumable destocking. As such, bookings for this group were down high single digits in the quarter. Importantly, this group did a very nice job managing margins and cash flow in the quarter. Gatan declined in the quarter as we expected. And as we have announced, the agreement to sell the Thermo has been terminated over regulatory concerns. As we turn to the guidance for the second half, we see organic revenues increasing 1% to 3% for the segment. Our medical products and Neptune businesses which are roughly 70% of the segments revenues are expected to increase mid-single digit plus for the balance of the year. For a shorter cycle industrial business again 25% of the segments revenues. We expect these businesses to be down high single digits for the second half of the year. This assumes the late second quarter industrial slowdown continues for the balance of the year. And for Gatan and given the Gatan sale of Thermo was terminated in the quarter. We have now included Gatan in our full year and second half guidance. Specifically, we’ve added approximately $0.20 of DEPS to the second half. Also, we expect to be modest organic decline for Gatan given the record 2018 comps. Finally, we have reengaged a sale process for Gatan. While early in the relaunch process we received strong interest from many parties. Gatan is a very good business with an exceptional management team. We’re committed to completing the sale process with Gatan but if we do not receive compelling economic and contractual offers, we look forward to owning Gatan over the long-term, engaging with Saunders [ph] and his team and investing for its long-term success. Next page. As we turn to our process technology segments in the quarter, the segment represented 12% of Roper's revenue, revenue was a $164 million which was down 5% on organic basis. EBITDA was $60 million, which represented an amazing 36.6% margin. Our upstream oil and gas businesses declined as expected against a very challenging comp which was plus 20% from a year ago. That said, the business has executed very nimbly in the quarter and drove outstanding margins across the segment. EBITDA margins were up 200 basis points in the quarter. Role of CCC, we continue to see strength into our LNG product pipeline. Finally, Metrix delivered a record quarter based on strong demand for their vibration monitoring systems and controls across multiple end markets. Turning to the outlook. We see minus 1% to 3% organic growth for the segment for the balance of the year and do see easing comps in Q4 versus Q3. As we have discussed, the potential for upside may exist based on expanded takeaway capacity and or higher oil prices, but we have not assumed this is going to happen in our outlook for the second half. Now let’s turn to our guidance update. We’re updating our DEPS guidance to a range of $12.94 to $13.06 compared to our prior guidance of $12.70 to $13. This increase to our guidance range primarily relate to the inclusion of Gatan, which we expect to add approximately $0.207 to second half DEPS. Given the dynamics around the divestiture process, we do expect there to be greater than a normal variability in Gatan’s second half results. Our DEPS and organic growth guidance assume that the short cycle industrial pause that we saw late in the second half continues for the remainder of the year. while recent trends may just be a soft patch, we do not have visibility into the second half recovery for our industrial businesses. And more importantly, we do not want our business leaders to assume a bounce back occurs. Accordingly, we are lowering our revenue assumptions for those businesses and expect our industrial business leaders to focus on continuing to deliver high margin and strong cash flow. Should industrial trends improve, our guidance for those businesses could prove conservative. As it should be clear from the content of our remarks on this call, the vast majority approximately 80% of our enterprise continues to have strong momentum, growing roughly 5% on an organic basis. Rolled up to our tax rate, we assume the rates for the second half to be approximately 21%. And finally, we’re establishing our Q3 adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of 3.16 to 3.20. Now let’s turn to the Q2 summary. We saw great execution and cash performance across the enterprise. EBITDA increased 5%, margins expanded, and free cash flow grew 14% in the quarter. Importantly, our CRI discipline improvement business models continue to provide a scale platform for long term to systematic growth. Now turning to capital deployment. First and as the primary source for our capital deployment funding, our excellent cash performance will continue. With leverage approaching two times trailing EBITDA, our balance sheet is very well-positioned to be offensive. Through the extent we’re able to successfully complete the sale of Gatan, we will be even better position to accelerate our cash flow compound, also it is nice to see the Moody’s upgrade, the BAA2 and a sustained S&P BBB plus ratings for a bond. Rolled to the outlook for acquisitions and our pipeline commentary, we continue to see a very large number of very high-quality assets. We’ll always remain patient, but we are very active in maturing a number of opportunities in the pipeline. Importantly, it’s always good to remind everyone that our CRI orientation and M&A processes help us identify and execute on the very best acquisition ideas. Now as we turn to questions, I want to remind everyone that we do is very simple. We compound cash flow. By running a portfolio of operating businesses that have market leading position and niche industry. We provide the business leaders with Socratic coaching about what great looks like relative to strategy, operations, innovation and talent development. We incent our management teams based on growth. We have a culture of mutual trust and transparency and finally, we take our excess free cash flow and deploy it to buy businesses that have better cash returns than our existing company. These simple ideas deliver powerful results. Now let's go and turn it over to the questions.
Operator: Thank you. And now we'll begin the question-and-answer session of the call. [Operator Instructions] And moving first to Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Deane.
Rob Crisci: Good morning.
Deane Dray: I don't normally have the opportunity or the responsibility of asking you about short cycle industrial softness in the quarter is just, it's not typically something that we're talking about, but it's presenting itself here. So, can you provide some more color on the, kind of the cadence in the quarter the push out some of the destocking? And what visibility do you have? And if you can get it by business that might give us some context? And start there, please?
Neil Hunn: I'll appreciate the question. I'll give you some thoughts and ask Rob, if he has any additional. So, its first say, we got to note that we're, it's 8% of our business, it's 6 or 7 businesses over 45 that we're talking about. And we're maybe not the best read across to other things. But I'll tell you what we saw. So, April was just fine. Really no issues there. May saw a little bit of weakness and June saw a lot of weakness. Interestingly, it was across really all of the industrial businesses that we have, it was across geographies Europe might have been a little bit weaker than North America, but nothing discernible. And really, across different various end market it was an isolated to one end market. What we think, what we saw also was projects push, and then a bit of consumable or spare sort of destocking, right. So, it's really across both the capital piece and the recurring piece. Interesting, the first three weeks or so in July, we saw a pretty meaningful recovery. But we don't yet know enough, if that's just a bounce back from June or if it's -- or what the real root cause was, for a while we saw the declination across the quarter. It was window dressing for the quarter or if it was something around trade, tensions or something -- some folks waiting for lower interest rates, we don't yet know the root cause. And so, it's just a little too early for us to call a specific direction. So, we chose to be what we think is relatively concerted here. So, we saw down mid-single to the second quarter, our assumption is down high singles for the balance of the year. And we're managing the businesses assuming that that occurs, right. We don't want our leaders in these businesses to get sort of caught assuming a recovery and then it doesn't happen, then you have a margin problem. So, that's a bit of the color. And if Rob if you want to add any additional.
Rob Crisci: Yes. Sure. So just a clearly sighs that as Neil mentioned that 8% of the company's revenue about 25% of that segment. So, this is not included in Neptune. Neptune continues to grow, it exactly the same sort of mid-single digit plus, it's just the businesses that Neil mentioned. So, the bookings were down sort of high-single-digits. And therefore, we're assuming the second half of the year is high-single-digit declines where we used to have flat, so it's about 25 million of revenue that comes out of the second half. That's really the only sort of change in the entire company and what we're seeing at this point versus three months ago,
Deane Dray: It's helpful. And if I'm looking to calibrate how the slowing on the organic side ripples through into your guidance. Just to make sure, I've got the right pieces here. Gatan adding back $0.20, it looks like the tax rate a bit lower is adding $0.08 versus our estimate. So then when I look at the midpoint raise, it does look like there is a second half lower operating guidance. It's something in the high teens sense if that's right and maybe try some context there.
Rob Crisci: So, the tax rate is slightly lower that’s offset by higher share count, little bit higher interest, we are losing some proceeds from Gatan that impact to interest. So, those other things sort of cancel each other out is really around $0.10 on industrial is the big change.
Deane Dray: That's helpful. Just last one for me on Gatan, was there any loss of momentum in the sales process. You mentioned some slowing, but it sounds like those were tough comps, but is there any momentum loss in the business as it's brought back into Roper?
Neil Hunn: So, the team at Gatan really should be applauded for how well they executed and performed over what has been a really long drawn out 18 months, 12 to 18 months process here, The business performed amazingly well last year with sort of new product cycle and as expect with Gatan, it sort of drive up a new product cycle and you moderate a little bit and you drive up on another product cycle. So, we're just in that moderation phase, but the team is just I mean A plus across the board with the distraction of sales process, which was immense and given sort of the CMA sort of process here in the last six months. So, great, great remarks to the team there and were certainly - add momentum to try to re-market the process, the business now and have a better outcome.
Rob Crisci: And I would just add, they did perform very well in the second quarter. So good performance.
Deane Dray: Thank you.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Moving next to Robert McCarthy at Stephens. Sir?
Robert McCarthy: Hi, guys. Good morning. Sorry, I'm about jumping from call to call, but I guess the first question is building on Deane's excellent questions, in terms of the short cycle, you are not planning for any kind of contemplated balancing guidance here. You're telling your business heads to kind of focus on cash and margin, which is sensible. You said I think six or seven of your segments are really - are your companies within the broader of it, are kind of affected, I mean have you highlighted the past exactly which one of these segments or sub-segments these are and could you just kind of highlight what you're seeing with that kind of level of granularity.
Neil Hunn: So, it's the thing I should have mentioned related to Deane's question is, the Strewers, alpha, it's Danisco, it's Hardy [ph], I mean there is four or five other that are much smaller but the trends and I just talked about are consistent across all of this, they are not isolated to one. It was very consistent read across our seven or eight companies here on the trends that we said, but it’s the industrial complex that 8% of revenue that we have.
Robert McCarthy: And then with respect to Gatan, I was under the impression that there were not that many natural buyers or potentially, I guess private equity. But could you talk about the fact that you think you've got a lot of interest because that doesn’t square with what I have heard maybe I’m just an idiot, but I will leave it there?
Neil Hunn: We know what Gatan is right, it’s a clear market leader, it has great growth prospects of a longer time, it's got a great team and amazing cash flow and so, as a result, there is a lot of people that are interested in a business like that, strategic and sponsors alike.
Robert McCarthy: Okay. And then the final question is you know, I was going to ask about obviously, the Foundry acquisition. It sounds like you answered the question, it sounds this elevation of - is it Jody Madden that you've kind of taken the key man risk or the key creative soul risk out of the equation, because obviously you think about companies with this nexus of technology and entertainment. You think about Steve Jobs or Jim Hansen or whoever the case may be, you don't want that person walking out the door, I mean would you say she rises to that level when there are other people within the company or the organization that you've made a real strong push to just retain because obviously at the end of the day. This is probably much more of a human capital business than some of the others?
Neil Hunn: Well, first I would say Foundry really like all of our software businesses is just a really boring software business, right. The great software that enables creators then do amazing work. Right. We're not the creative part of the ecosystem or supply chain and visual effects, we're the enabling toolkit that allows that to happen. Sort of maybe the first statement that’s highly consistent characteristics with really every Roper business, not just the product software businesses, but the product businesses. The team, I think we mentioned last quarter that the totality of the Foundry team that we met in the diligence process and confirmed here in the first little bit of ownership, the breadth of that team, that depth of that team is quite strong. And when we sat down and did the onboarding and started to engage with the team about our long-term orientation, multiyear product strategy, multiyear go to market strategies. It just became very clear to the incumbent CEO, Jody, ourselves that the most natural fit for the long-term success inside of our framework was Jody. And she's, she's fantastic. She's for the last four or five years has been the face of the company relative to the product. And we're expecting her to do great things with the business.
Robert McCarthy: Thanks for entertaining my questions. Congratulations for a great quarter.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Christopher Glynn at Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning. I had a question about some of the pipeline dynamics that seem to come up a lot where, you have kind of a surfeit of actionable deals, but opportunity cost dynamics are always at play. I'm wondering how that works as a partial gate to timing of deal flow. And as a curiosity, when was the last time you had kind of an air pocket and actionable pipeline dynamics?
Neil Hunn: I've been at Roper for eight years, and I cannot recall a real air pocket in terms of the pipeline. I mean, it's always a steady drumbeat, multiple deals, presented at near final stages to our board, five times a year. I mean, so air pockets or? I can't recall, I'm looking at Rob he, he's agreeing with me. Relative to we're always to your first question about opportunity cost. I mean, this is a very, it's a debate we have on every transaction, right? You're coming across one that it looks really good, right? It has all the characteristics, we look for niche, leadership, great team, accretive CRI, accretive organic growth rate you know the list. And or like and the price might be X and are like, that really looks good. But is there something better that's just right around the corner. So, we're always having the opportunity costs discussion. And it's one of those things that that we've sort of honed over the years, and we do the best we can relative to that decision. It's obviously an opportunity cost decision. One, where we don't have perfect information about what's around the corner. And then we're always steeped in what gives us real confidence. And ultimately, everything we do is we're just steeped in the cash return methodology. There's always that buffer built in day one when we buy a company relative to the values created for shareholders. And so that's at least how we think about it. Rob, you want to add any color to that.
Rob Crisci: No, there is always an opportunity. And it's just a matter of finding the best deals at the right price and getting them done.
Christopher Glynn: Okay, thanks. And then follow up is on TransCore, the product implementing without you. That seems pretty groundbreaking for TransCore, maybe I'm wrong. But could you elaborate on that thought?
Neil Hunn: Well, hey, it's very early. We got a great partner in Gentex, right. They are the clear market leader in the smart mirror technology. And so, it's been a nice collaboration with them. But yes, I do believe it has the potential to be groundbreaking. You know think about cars 10 years ago, or five years ago, you didn't have auto sensing, lane departure systems and whatnot. Now, they're almost standard. So, I don't know if this technology becomes standard like that, but it's certainly our hope that it would. And it's great to have Audi as the first partner. There is a lot of work that had to be done not just in the technology that goes in the car, but also how you deal with intra-tolling agency and customer relationships and how you deal with the billing and, and that's all been figured out by the partnership between TransCore and Gentex. It’s super early, but we certainly thought it was exciting one of the highlights for everybody today.
Christopher Glynn: Sounds good. Thanks.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Barclays and Julian Mitchell.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Jason [ph] on for Julian's. Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Hey, Jason.
Unidentified Analyst: Maybe just a question on the Gatan add back guidance. It was sort of our impression that the annualized Gatan divestment impact would be closer to $0.60 of EPS adding back 20 just kind of wanting to reconcile the difference there just sort of the half year basis seems like it would be closer to 30. Is this sort of seasonality of earnings or are there other dynamics that plays of just lowered organic sales growth outlook? Even just as we're modeling for 2020, et cetera?
Rob Crisci: I think you have too high of a number for Gatan, full year of Gatan would be. So, this is consistent with sort of what we saw for the year all along. There's certainly a lot of variability in the potential for their performance in the second half as Neil mentioned. Now, I think that their fourth quarters are generally their highest quarter of the year. There's some seasonality there. So, there should have a better fourth quarter than the third quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: Understood. And then maybe moving a little bit away from the short cycle businesses to Deltek, I know it's been mentioned for a couple of quarters that there's bolt-on M&A sort of going on there. Is that still the plan for Deltek moving forward? It seems like the booking’s growth is doing quite well. I just wondering if that was still a strategic focus with the business?
Neil Hunn: Sure, I mean, it has been and for a long time, it even predates our ownership Deltek sort of did one-ish bolt-on a year before we owned it for several years, we're probably at that pace or maybe just a touch higher in our ownership. And we would expect that to be the case going forward.
Unidentified Analyst: Understood. And it seems like the in moving on to CCC, just in the new construction business seems like it had the expected strength that you sort of called out in previous calls. Just kind of wondering where that you view that strength of the LNG pipeline in terms of its still extremely early innings or four to six quarters, seems like a reasonable baseline timeline for that?
Neil Hunn: Yeah. So, what's characterized is some of these projects that are in development are actually smaller and quicker to come online than what we may have might have seen five, seven, eight years ago. So, in the past, it would have been multiple years, so I think your four to six quarters is probably more in-line with the expectations. You might drag out a little bit longer as you know these projects do, but these are not five to 10-year projects or three to seven-year projects, they tend to be smaller record to turn on.
Unidentified Analyst: Understood. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we'll go next to Steve Tusa at JPMorgan.
Stephen Tusa: Hey, guys, good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Steve.
Rob Crisci: Good morning.
Stephen Tusa: Appreciate the use of the term of Socratic [ph] coaching. That was a political science major. I'm not I'm not quite sure what that means, but I kind of get it. On the software businesses, I guess, the application software business. I mean, I read all these other companies, transcripts, and I don't quite know what I'm reading but they use the term bookings a lot. How is the booking like the organic bookings growth as you guys define it for, I guess that segment?
Neil Hunn: Steve, so let me Socraticly walk you through this.
Stephen Tusa: I need some -- I clearly need some coaching as well. So, I just appreciate a little color.
Neil Hunn: Yeah, but for the segment now, we've got to go company-by-company around bookings, right. So, I mean, that's a harder question to answer because it's -- we don't know anything up at the segment level.
Rob Crisci: Maybe bookings and gap sort of bookings.
Neil Hunn: Sure. So, bookings in this case is or another term, you might hear uses order intake. So, it's what is -- what businesses actually contracted in a period of time and you have to do a fair amount of, sort of equivalency between a perpetual deal and a SaaS deal. And so -- and then, and obviously, when you booked something, you could have double-digit bookings. And then if it's all SaaS, then it's going to take four quarters right to get into the run rate. So, your gap revenue will lag, could lag that a little bit. And then on perpetual, you might book something in the second quarter, and you might not be able to recognize the revenue because of some delivery in the software and it might be pushed out a quarter or two as things are being implemented. So, bookings are just a little bit more -- order intakes a little bit more of an early read of business activity that's ongoing in the company. So, in Deltek's case, which we highlighted, we had the hard comp against the wonderful second quarter of last year, which by the way is a great problem to have because we want so much business on a perpetual basis a year ago. And when we sort of normalize for the outsized perpetual growth a year ago at Deltek, bookings are up double-digits this quarter. So, the activity inside that business review is healthy.
Stephen Tusa: Got it. Okay. And so that's up inside that business that was up like, I don't know, those bookings are like double-digit or like high singles, that's kind of what gives you confidence for the second half in the next year, if you will?
Neil Hunn: That's right. It's a combination of the bookings. And then you're also looking out several quarters at pipeline coverage and pipeline sort of conversion rates and things but the combination between that and the near-term bookings is what give us the confidence.
Stephen Tusa: Okay. Were there any businesses in that application software side that were down on revenue?
Neil Hunn: Well, in that we know, your favorite topic of Sundquest is in this segment and it was down mid-singles, as we expect - it actually did modestly better here in the quarter in the first half, we thought, but other than that everything was up pretty much.
Stephen Tusa: Okay, that's great. And then one last one, acquisition pipeline, standard question. Are you bullish about -- any more bullish about the second half relative to couple months ago, anything loosening up or does the kind of macro environment delayed some of the activity you may have thought you would have seen?
Neil Hunn: I would say we feel the same today as we felt last quarter-to-quarter before. I mean, the market and the activity are there, its robust, there is lots of work. We're looking at lots of things as we always do, and you just never know until the very last minute in a deal if it's going to sort of one that we actually want execute, and one that we can actually lend from a value in contractual terms perspective, but it's steady as she goes on the M&A front.
Rob Crisci: Yeah, there is nothing in the macro environment that -- there is nothing in the macro environment that impact these deal processes at all. They're hopping [ph] and, you know?
Stephen Tusa: Okay. Super. All right, guys. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the detail.
Neil Hunn: Our pleasure.
Operator: And we'll go next to Joe Giordano at Cowen and Company.
Joe Giordano: Hey guys, good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Joe Giordano: So now that we're getting into a little bit of an industrial cycle, I guess the question that you guys typically get asked, will get asked a lot more, like, how does this make you think about some of your industrial businesses from a long-term basis. Does it become somewhat of a nuisance when 8% of your company becomes something that gets talked about more than 8% of the time as we enter these types of things, and how do you think about the positions of those businesses within the context of Roper long-term?
Neil Hunn: Yeah, so its first, these businesses are amazing. I would just draw you to the profitability of both, the industrial businesses and the process segments. They're amazing businesses, they're clear leaders in their niche, they're just they're fantastic. Yeah, they have a little bit of cyclicality associated with them. But we've worked over the last decade, to meaningfully reduce the cyclicality. And it was roughly a 50% tie that these businesses these more cyclical businesses a decade ago, and now we're about 20%. And so that trend will continue as we deploy the capital going forward. We're generally deploying a thing that don't have a large cyclical component. So, continue to de-emphasize sort of the cyclical aspects, but they're great businesses and it's and we like them in the portfolio.
Rob Crisci: And they're designed to be incredibly profitable at all points of the cycle right there. As you know, we're always looking at the breakeven analysis, what’s the fix cost, what’s the variable cost. Our business leaders are very, very proactive. So, they're always going to generate a lot of cash in all environments, and their position to succeed over the long-term. So, we believe we're a great owner for those businesses.
Joe Giordano: Okay. Yeah, you guys have been very consistent with that answer over time. So, appreciate that. Are there any specific cost actions that you're looking at, as we enter this period, though, for them, like is there any unique cost out opportunities that you're that you now you can execute as things kind of slow for them?
Neil Hunn: I wouldn't say unique, but what maybe is unique about the Roper model, and this is just building on Rob said, these businesses structurally are highly variable in their nature, they buy structural, right. So, any sort of cost actions can happen pretty quickly and without lots of sort of riff or cost to get the cost out, if you will. And so, the companies also naturally start feeling and pulsing their way when they feel softness and take the actions out, any sort of direction from us, right. And so, we're certainly talking with them and understanding what they're doing. And making sure their assumptions are aligned with our assumptions about what the future looks like. And then they go about doing what they do in managing their businesses.
Joe Giordano: Okay. And maybe last for me. Just curious about your -- the outlook, maybe from your customers standpoint about some of the commercial building sectors that you're exposed to. And I know there is some nuance with some of your businesses, whereas if some construction volumes go down a little bit, it's actually good for like a business like in ConstructConnect thing that used to help and funding the work, but just generally like what are your -- are your customers, kind of getting raised antennas about the health of the or directionality of their businesses over the near-term of very robust levels?
Neil Hunn: Yeah, hard to get a read across that, like you said at our ConstructConnect business, which is in the pre-construction part of commercial real estate development. We actually root for a a neutral to slightly positive, slightly bearish market, because that increases the value of what we deliver to our customers. But it's -- I don't have as we sit here today great read across or read through from ConstructConnect on broader construction themes. So far and it will help you there.
Joe Giordano: Fair enough. Thanks guys.
Neil Hunn: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's call. And at this time, it's my pleasure to turn the conference back over to Zack Moxcey. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: And once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. And again, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-25 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Roper Technologies First Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Zack Moxcey.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the first quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you'll please turn to slide 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments to acquire deferred revenue and lastly, we have adjusted our income statement to exclude the gain on sale from the divestiture of our Scientific Imaging businesses.  We have also adjusted our cash flow statement to exclude the cash taxes paid as a result of the sale. GAAP requires this payment to be classified as an operating cash flow item even though it is related to the divestiture.  And now if you will please turn to Slide 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. We'll start our call today with the enterprise highlights and financial results for the quarter. We'll then turn to our segment detail and outlook followed by an update to our 2019 guidance and the establishment of our second quarter guidance. And then turn it over to questions. Next page. We characterize the first quarter here as a strong start to the year with strong organic growth, operating leverage and cash flow as well as capital deployment. Revenue grew 7% to $1.29 billion with organic growth coming in at 6%. EBITDA improved 13% to $438 million, and margins expanded 170 basis points to 34%. Importantly, we saw margin expansion across all 4 segments, which indicates the breadth of the strength of the quarter. Free cash flow improved 15% to $312 million or 24% of revenue. It's always great to see the expansion down the P&L. Revenue grew 7%; EBITDA, 13%; free cash flow grew 15%. So the leverage expansion down the P&L is always something we'd like to see. Also in the quarter, we announced our new segmentation, and we'll talk about that in a few slides. Importantly, we completed the sale of our Scientific Imaging businesses on February 5th. And we also completed the acquisition of Foundry earlier this month. Certainly a good quarter. And now I'll turn it over to Rob to walk us through the P&L.
Rob Crisci: Thanks, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the income statement metric page. Revenue grew 7%, 6% organically, as Neil mentioned, to $1.288 billion. We had our 3 largest segments, each grew organically between 6% and 9%. Our smallest segment, Process Technologies, grew 1%, which did exceed our expectations for the quarter. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 63% as we continue to benefit from our increased mix of high-margin software businesses. So we are very well positioned should any macro headwinds build around tariffs and material cost inflation or anything that's like that, really would have minimal impact for Roper as they have historically had very minimal impact. EBITDA grew 13% with EBITDA margin expanding to 34%. We really had very high leverage in the quarter aided by a couple of items: the timing of some perpetual software license wins where revenue is recognized at the time of delivery and also some compliance payments in our GPO network business that really come in at close to 100% margins. So that impacted the leverage in the quarter, which was very strong. Earnings before taxes grew 15%. As you can see, our tax rate was lower than expected at 9.7%. This includes a $43 million or $0.41 discrete benefit due to foreign restructuring. We've been simplifying our legal entity structure to make it easier to access and repatriate our foreign cash and as a result, we will be able to realize some net operating losses in the future. So overall, our DEPS of $3.30 was an increase of 26%. If we adjust out for the tax item, we were still at $2.89, which was a very strong quarter for Roper overall. Moving on to the next slide. Always one of our favorites, the asset-light business model. So the networking capital position at the end of the first quarter: inventory 4.5% of revenue; receivables, 16.6%; payables, 10.8%; deferred revenue grew to 13.5%. The deferred revenue grew 19% on a year-over-year basis, ending the quarter at $694 million. So if you add that altogether, we had negative 3% of working capital really for the first quarter 3 years in a row down to 3.3%. Foundry, our recent acquisition, which we'll talk more about shortly, has a significant negative net working capital balance that will further enhance our position and continue to expand our ability to compound cash flow moving forward. The net working capital for Roper remains a source of cash. Next slide. On compounding cash flow, so aided by our negative networking capital, organic growth, disciplined capital employment, we continue to produce excellent cash flow results and excellent cash flow compounding. The Q1 operating cash flow was $330 million, an increase of 17% versus prior year. As Zack mentioned at the beginning of the call, this excludes the $39 million cash payment related to the Scientific Imaging divestiture completed during the quarter. Free cash flow, as Neil mentioned, grew 15%, represented 24% of revenue. So if you look at it on a TTM basis, we are nearly $1.5 billion of operating cash flow, up 30% versus prior year, really fantastic result. And that represented 28% of revenue over the previous 12 months. So certainly, we believe that cash remains the best measure of performance. Next slide. So moving to the strong financial position in the balance sheet slide. We ended the first quarter with our gross debt of $4.5 billion, net debt of $4.1 billion against TTM EBITDA now approaching $1.9 billion. So our gross debt-to-EBITDA of 2.4x and our net debt-to-EBITDA down all the way to 2.2 times at the end of the quarter. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we did close and fund the Foundry acquisition where we really used a combination of cash and debt. So if we adjust for the Foundry acquisition, we are still down to 2.4 times net debt. Furthermore, the Gatan divestiture would bring an additional $700 million of cash. When that is closed, we're assuming the end of the second quarter in the guidance. And so that would further decrease our leverage position. So in summary, we remain very well positioned to continue to deploy capital moving forward towards our pipeline of high-quality acquisition target. So with that, I'll turn it back to Neil to review the segments.
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Rob. If we can turn now to Page 11 where we're summarizing our new segments. Earlier in the quarter, we did announce the new segments. To remind everyone, our resegmentation process was not a portfolio or a business review. Also, the resegmentation does not have anything to do with how we run or operate our governance model but rather how we summarize the activities of our 45 businesses in a manner that is more easily understood by investors and is more consistent with our strategy. So to this end, we chose to resegment based on a business model construct versus end market.  As you know, as we deploy capital, we are not constrained by end markets as we are in pursuit of acquiring the best business models available, the essence of our cash return on investment-led strategy. Hence, it makes the most sense to organize in this manner. Starting with Application Software. This is the first of our 2 software segments. This segment has businesses that are delivering software applications to customers. You can see the businesses included in the segment, Aderant, Deltek, PowerPlan, Strata, to name a few. Perhaps the easiest to understand is Aderant. Aderant delivers enterprise Application Software to law firms. These customers will run their business on Aderant software. This segment represented 28% of our 2018 revenues, has gross margins of 67% and EBITDA margins of 40%. Now turning to our Network, Software & Systems segment. This is our second software segment. These businesses are ones that have a network component to their business model. Think of situations where the customers derive benefit not only from our software but also being part of a broader network. An example of a network business is DAT. DAT is our two-sided network that matches thousands of brokers and tens of thousands of carriers into full truckload spot freight market.  This segment represented 26% of our 2018 revenues, has gross margins of 68% and EBITDA margins of 43%. On the bottom left is our Measurement & Analytical Solutions segment. Think of this segment as one of our 2-product segments that is diversified in terms of end markets and has quite stable long-term growth. This segment has our medical product portfolio as well as our industrial test and measurement type businesses. The segment represented 33% of our 2018 revenues, had gross margins of 59% and EBITDA margins of 33%. And finally, on the bottom right is our Process Technologies segment, by far, our smallest segment and our second product segment. This segment has 10 businesses that are largely indexed to the oil and gas end market. While this segment represents only 13% of our revenues last year, they have incredible business model: 56% gross margins and 36% EBITDA margins. Clearly, they are still a collection of assets in the space. Turning to the next page, Application Software. Revenue in the quarter, which represented 30% of our first quarter results was $382 million, an increase of 7% organically. EBITDA was $149 million, which grew 23% versus the prior year and represented a 39% margin. We saw a continued strong performance at Deltek. They turned in high single-digit revenue growth with great operating leverage and multiple enterprise or large customer wins in the quarter. Importantly, we saw continued double-digit growth in their SaaS and subscription revenue stream based on acquiring net new customers and having successful conversions from on-premise to SaaS. One thing we may not talk enough about with Deltek is really the balance and durability of their growth drivers. There are many growth drivers for this business. They attack the small and medium-size businesses as well as large enterprise businesses. They have the government contracting business, there are product lines as well as they serve the professional services market. They have North American focus and a European and rest of the world focus. They certainly have an on-premise capability and a SaaS capability. So the businesses has had a great run of growth and it's not leveraged to one or a small number of growth vectors. It's really tied to a large breadth of opportunity. So a great job by the team at Deltek. We also saw in the quarter outstanding growth at Strata, which was led by strength in its Hospital Decision Support SaaS bookings. We don't talk a lot about Strata. Just to remind you what they do is this is a core solution used by hospitals and health systems, in particular, the CFO's office, to model the changing nature of hospitals' economics. Over the last several years, hospitals have had to be more risk bearing in terms of the care they deliver and as a result, they need to more intimately understand the connections between their cost structure, their risk-based revenue contracts and Strata sells software that provides visibility to that for hospital CFO's and their financial staffs. So great job by Dan and John and the entire team at Strata for the growth they turned in. We also continue to see share gains in large law coupled with a very successful attach rate of the new SaaS billing product at Aderant. Great job with the continuation of the execution there. PowerPlan is focused on building pipeline in their core product offerings following a very strong lease accounting software demand over the past several quarters. And finally, we'll highlight CBORD's growth in their food and nutrition software sales to their health care end market. As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we see 4% to 6% organic growth in this segment. The second quarter EBITDA margins we see coming in similar to that of the first quarter as we expect a greater mix of SaaS versus perpetual in the second quarter as compared to last year. This is particularly driven by our strategy of pacing our SaaS conversions at the pace that our customers desire. So the results in some will vary quarter-to-quarter or have some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter based on the mix between SaaS and on-premise. For instance, Deltek had very strong perpetual in the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. So before we turn to the next slide, last quarter, we talked generically about our SaaS -- or cloud migration strategy, the long-term benefits that will be enjoyed by our customers and the positive implications for our business model. To briefly summarize, first and importantly, we asked our businesses to move at the pace of our customers versus forcing the conversion on our timetable. Time and time again, this has proven to be the winning strategy. In several cases, we've been the benefactor of competitors' decisions to force the timetable as their customers have migrated to our solution. Next, we believe the SaaS deployment model has many inherent benefits for the customer: easier enablement of upgrades and new features, lower cost of total ownership, elimination of technical operations and a single throat to choke, to name a few. Relative to our business model, the cloud transition greatly enhances the ability to sell and deploy add-on products, deploy new features more broadly and at a faster pace, drive increased back office and tech stack efficiency, improve cash return investment, all while being a net growth driver. Also, let's not forget that all our software solutions are very specific built-for-purpose solutions targeted at solving very specific customer pain points, the essence of our niche strategy. All of our software businesses are in some phase of their cloud migration, again, paced by our customers interest in moving to the cloud. One example, a good example of our cloud migration experience to be highlighted with Deltek. Deltek launched its cloud offering in 2011 over 8 years ago.  Over this period, they deployed over 10,000 customers to their cloud offering. Importantly, during Roper's ownership, we've invested significantly north of 15% of revenue in R&D, much of which has been centered on user experience, building and launching new products such as VantagePoint and the continual migration of our tech stack to the cloud. By pacing at their clients desire to move to the cloud, Deltek has been quite successful at keeping a very modern code base and tech stack while building new products and delivering new product features. All of this has resulted in consistent high single-digit organic growth, an increase in recurring revenue to be approximately 70% and the continuation of very high customer retention rate. Next slide, please. Network Software & Systems revenue in the quarter represented 27% of Roper's revenue and was $346 million, which indicated a 9% increase organically. EBITDA was $150 million and represented a 43.3% margin. In the quarter, we saw just excellent growth at DAT from continued net subscriber adds and increased revenue per customer. It's important to note that this network has value to its constituents in different macroeconomic environments. Regardless, the value is very strong whether the trucking and shipping market is running hot, there's value to the participants or if it cooled off a little bit as we saw in the second quarter, it still has tremendous value as shippers and carriers are trying to match networks for the loads. So we saw a very nice growth in the quarter at the DAT business. We also saw strong performance at MHA for market share gains and vendor contract compliance. To remind you, MHA is our network that connects thousands of health care providers to hundreds of vendors in the marketplace in a procurement network. And so it's great to see the strong performance in MHA. iTrade grew based on strong renewal activity and net subscriber additions. And late in the first quarter, iTrade announced a block chain initiative with the goal to increase safety, sustainability and visibility of the food supply chain. Using block chain or a decentralized ledger, iTrade will more easily enable interested parties to gain access to the relevant data.  iTrade will leverage its network of over 5,000 growers, retailers, distributors, restaurant operators and logistics providers in building the network. Importantly, most of the data needed for this farm to fork traceability block chain already exists natively within the iTrade application. The iTrade block chain is designed for interoperability, using the same industry standards utilized by IBM Food Trust and others. This is a great example of the leadership position that many of our businesses take within their industry niche. We saw double-digit growth from RF IDeas in a secure print and identity management solution. This is business we acquired a number of years ago. It's really a fantastic business.  What they do is think of the security badge you have to get into your building from a physical perspective. RF IDeas makes an integrated reader that reads the hundreds of protocols for those security badges, and the readers use a nonsecurity situation. So imagine secure print. The printer companies and OEMs embed a reader in the printers, and then you can go use any of these security protocols to then credential you to have a secure print. Or in the health care setting, think about secure sign-on for doctors and nurses relative to the electronic medical records. Instead of having to type their name and password in, they can use their credential. It allows them to see more patients. So the company has done a great job at working with, scores of OEMs embed their technology into their end application. And we've seen great growth over several quarters at RF IDeas.  We'll return to TransCore. They had, again, excellent execution in the back office software and services, and they always do a great job with the tolling project execution. And we saw low single-digit growth in that business. And as we mentioned earlier, we completed the acquisition of Foundry last week. That business is a network. We'll describe that here shortly. It will be housed in our network Software & Systems segment. So as we turn to the outlook for the 2Q to 4Q, we see 4% to 6% organic growth for the segment for the balance of the year. We also see Q2 '19 EBITDA margins to be similar to that of Q1. And before we turn to the next slide, and it's specific to a targeted TransCore pursuit, we'll be honored if we were to be selected to be the technology and implementation partner for the Manhattan congestion pricing initiative. While still in procurement, TransCore has deployed its very best team and look forward to working with the authority if given the opportunity. Next slide. The Foundry acquisition. Boy, this is just a great acquisition for us, and it meets all of our criteria. Starting, it has tremendous cash flow characteristics and negative net working capital, so it checks the box clearly and unambiguously from a cash return point of view. The management team that we met is really stellar. Oftentimes when you're meeting a management team, they have a -- they have 6 people or so you're meeting during the process, and you like the majority of them but there's always 1 or 2 that you're not so sure about. In this case, the entire team was just fantastic from top to bottom. We're excited to work with them. In a minute, we'll talk about, in detail, the niche orientation they have and the clear leadership position they have in that niche, but they are clearly the standard in what they do. And as a result, they have super deep domain experience, high recurring revenues given their long tenure in what they do, and then multiple opportunities to grow. The purchase price is $410 million, and we view it to be immediately cash accretive. For the first 12 months of ownership, we expect there to be about $75 million of revenue come in roughly at 40% EBITDA margins, so it would be about $25 million of unleveraged free cash flow. And we view this as a high single-digit organic grower. Foundry is a great niche software business that enjoys several network benefits, and we're excited to have them join the Roper family. But first, what do they do? Foundry software is used to composite or combine visual effects, animation and 3D content in the media entertainment and digital design industry. So what does this mean? My way of example, and if you're a Game of Thrones fan and no spoilers here, the compositing or combining of all the period scenes with computer-generated dragons with live-action fire with a computer-generated legions of soldiers is enabled and completed by Foundry Software Solutions. With its 20 years of history, Foundry has become the standard for compositing in the media entertainment industry. In digital design, Foundry addresses the gap in the market for artist-friendly 3D software use and design. With Foundry software, their clients are able to create photo-ready designs of new product concepts that massively reduce new product development time tables with significantly lower supply chain risk. Foundry's customers range from Pixar to Mercedes to New Balance. Importantly, the business has over 30,000 customers and has deeply embedded global ecosystem or network of evangelists. The vast majority of computer graphic arts students are trained in college on Foundry's applications. They learn to composite using Foundry. Given the increase in computer-generated visual effects in virtually all media productions, the supply chain has developed in such a manner that Foundry is the communication standard for the outsourcing of visual effects. Foundry, again, is the standard tool used across the media entertainment industry use for compositing. In fact, Foundry has been used on every VFX Oscar award-winning film for the past decade. We believe Roper's long-term ownership and investment model will help extend Foundry's network effects and industry-leading position. Foundry is another great net software business for Roper. Next slide, and turning to our Measurement & Analytical solution segment. The revenue is represented 31% of our aggregate revenue across the enterprise in the quarter and were $402 million, an increase of 6% organically. EBITDA came in at $128 million and represented a 31.9% margin. We'll start, as we always do, with highlighting Neptune's continued high single-digit growth from their continued share gains driven by their customer-focused innovation. No weather impact there. Verathon had very solid execution of its new product launch for its next-generation GlideScope systems. It's off to a good start from the launch perspective, but it's still early. And we'll watch closely as how it unfolds for the balance of the year. We had a record quarter in Northern Digital, driven by optical measurement systems and consumables growth. From time to time, we talk about Northern Digital, but just to remind you, this is our measurement science business that has 2 core technologies, electromagnetics and optical, that's used principally in health care applications and embedded in OEM solutions.  And they measure with great precision where the tip of a surgeon instrument might be in brain surgery or where the tip of a catheter might be in the cardiac procedure and many others, so it's just a fantastic business. They are clearly the world's best at what they do and as we see it in the financial results and consistent. So really a great job by Dave and team up in Canada for doing a great job not just this quarter but over a long period of time.  CIVCO Medical Solutions had very broad-based growth driven by channel investments that we made over the course of last year, so it's great to see that business get even more intimate with the customers and see the results financially. Struers growth came from sales of equipment and consumables to multiple industrial end markets. And to remind you, Struers is our industrial materials prep and analysis business. Gatan saw double-digit growth from delivery of its next-generation cryo-EM backlog.  And as I mentioned at the onset of the call, we completed the divestiture of our Scientific Imaging businesses, but we did so a bit earlier than expected. It actually provided between $0.02 and a $0.03 headwind or impact versus what we thought would happen simply based on closing that transaction a bit earlier than we thought. As we turn to the outlook, we see segment revenues plus 4% to 6% organically for the balance of the year. However, for the second quarter, we expect low single-digit growth due to the timing of Gatan shipments pushing out of the second quarter. This is a $0.05 DEPS negative impact as compared to our expectation from a quarter ago. Finally, we continue to assume Gatan sale to Thermo will close at the end of the second quarter. Next slide. Process Technologies, which represented 12% of our revenue in the quarter. Revenue was a $158 million or an increase of 1% organic, and EBITDA was $53 million or a margin of 33.5%, just spectacular business this year. Cornell grew double digits from great performance in its industrial end markets, and we saw particular strength in its aftermarket activity. As we have highlighted in the past quarters, CCC grew, in this quarter, high single digits from execution against new LNG construction projects. Currently, there's 11 projects slated for construction around the globe. We're spec'd for 10 of them and have a chance to be spec'd in the final one. So we believe they'll be a series of quarters here of strong performance at CCC. We saw declines, as expected, from our upstream oil and gas businesses due principally to prior comps in the prior period. So upstream oil and gas in this segment is about 25% of the segment. Based on this quarter's slightly better performance versus our expectations and our quarterly views with our businesses, we are modestly increasing our outlook to be down 1% to 3% organically for the balance of the year versus down 1% to 5% for the whole year. We expect the second quarter to be roughly sequentially flattish to that of the first quarter. This equates to the second quarter being down high single digits, which is consistent with our initial outlook and due principally to a plus-20% comp from a year ago. Again, we see flattish revenue sequentially. For the second half, we see the business roughly flat on a year-over-year basis based on easing comps. So we remain cautious in our outlook here. If planned take away capacity comes online as expected and/or energy prices remain higher, then there may be some second half upside. We'll have to wait and see. Now let's turn to our guidance. We continue to be positioned for a strong 2019. And as such, we're raising our full year 2019 guidance. Adjusted DEPS is now $12.70 to $13 where previously it was $12 to $12.40. This includes the Foundry acquisition which closed on April 18. The guidance continues to assume the June 30th Gatan close. We're also improving our organic growth outlook to be 4% to 5% where previously it was 3% to 5%. Our tax rate, we assume, is approximately 22% for the balance of the year. Also, we're establishing our second quarter 2019 guidance with adjusted DEPS in the range of $3 to $3.04. Turn to the Q1 summary. Again, a great start. Our diversified portfolio of business delivered another excellent quarter, record first quarter results. We saw organic revenue grow 6%, EBITDA grew 13% and importantly, margins expanded in all 4 of our segments, so very broad execution. Free cash flow grew 15% to $312 million, which represented 24% of revenue. So great to see the leverage down the P&L. Again, organic revenue plus 6%, EBITDA plus 13% and free cash flow of plus 15%. It always starts with our CRI discipline, and we believe our proven business model provides a very scalable platform for continued growth. To this end, following our announcement of Satish Maripuri last quarter, we are delighted to share that Harold Flynn recently joined the Roper leadership team. Harold will focus his efforts on providing group leadership to a number of our product businesses. Harold is a very seasoned executive with experience at IDEXX Laboratories, Abbot and Zimmer. The combination of Jeff Paulson, Chris Krieps and Harold will provide leadership to our portfolio of product companies. Like Satish, Harold deeply understands Roper, our model, our approach. We're very excited to welcome Harold to our leadership team. Now turning to capital deployment. We are excited to have closed the Foundry transaction earlier this month. As we described earlier, we view this to be a near-perfect fit against our niche strategy and our network strategy and are excited to welcome Craig, Martin, Jody and the entire Foundry team to the Roper family. Setting Foundry aside, we continue to be excited about our capital deployment prospects in 2019. As Rob mentioned, our balance sheet remains super well positioned for a strong capital deployment for the balance of the year. The number of very high quality assets we've seen in the last several months continues to be encouraging, and our pipeline is quite full. Importantly, our CRI orientation and M&A process help us identify the very best businesses to acquire. Now as we turn to questions, we want to remind everyone that what we do is very simple. We compound cash flow by running a portfolio of operating businesses that have market-leading positions in niche industries. We provide the business leaders with Socratic coaching about what great looks like relative to strategy, operations, innovation and talent development. We incent our management teams based on growth. We have a culture of mutual trust and transparency and finally, we take our excess free cash flow and deploy it to buy businesses that have better cash returns than our existing company. These simple ideas deliver powerful results. We'll now turn it over to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: I wanted, just to start off with a comment that we appreciate all the hard work that went into that the resegmentation. And as promised, this recasting just makes a lot of sense since it's easier to see and explain the portfolio, so thank you for all, getting that to the finish line. And on Foundry, just your comments this morning. Just to let you know, you had me at Game of Thrones, so that actually worked for us. So first question is on Deltek. And it was interesting that you recently had a big database software cloud provider actually call out Deltek as an opportunity for them. Our experience is has been with good businesses with attractive margins. It can attract new competitors, but what do you make of this? And maybe some comments about the moat that Deltek has? And how you expect this to play out?
Neil Hunn: Yes. I appreciate the question. We read the same comments. There's a series of companies that were listed, so we'll talk specifically about Deltek. I can't comment at all about the other companies that were listed. And we certainly highlighted a number of those when we went through the, our SaaS strategy with Deltek. But I think, perhaps the most important thing to start with is that not just Deltek but all of our businesses are in niches and have very specific built-for-purpose software aimed at a specific user. And so if you think about Deltek, government contracting, right? it is a, we are the ax in that space from a software perspective. Virtually every large enterprise uses our software because of, it does what it does so well, you don't have to customize it or tweak it or tune it. It's both on-premise and in the cloud. And then you have a considerable amount of R&D resources that are just 100% focused on making that product better. Same thing can be said for the professional services end market. Deltek does not attack professional services broadly. They attack architects, they attack engineering firms, they attack marketing services firms, accounting firms, so very targeted. And the way those businesses run their business are not just generic to professional services. And so you buy our software out of the box, and a normal marketing services firm can actually deploy without any customizations at all in any way, shape or form where the larger places, you have to go through a SI layer and do sort of customizations, then you have to worry about upgradability of those and whatnot. So the core of what we do is preferred by our customers and that seen time and time again with win the rates is an excess of 50% when you go head to head for net new opportunities against the larger players. And then from a code-based, tech stack cloud strategy, I think we're as current as anybody can be in that business.
Deane Dray: That's all really helpful. Appreciate it. And then just as a follow-up, can you clarify what the drivers are on the boost to the low end of organic revenue growth for the year.
Rob Crisci: Yes. Sure. Good morning. This is Rob. I think overall, we certainly had some outperformance in the first quarter. And I think if we look at all of our segments, we see, sort of, at least as good as originally planned or a little bit better. I think specifically in the Process Technologies segment, which is the smallest segment, we upped our outlook there where we're not seeing sort of a downside as bad as we thought coming in. And so we're just up the bottom of the range a little bit. I'd say, overall, a little bit of outperformance everywhere and a little bit of a better outlook everywhere.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: So some of the businesses you acquire are -- lots of them always interesting to think about the network effect. Clearly, Foundry seems prohibitive of competitive risk. I'm wondering particularly with the network segment if any of these stronger results are kind of kicking into a higher gear, potentially you're accelerating a network effect breakout. And I'll anchor the question around MHA, and iTrade maybe suggest that dynamic.
Laurence Hunn: So I'll start broadly, and then try to get specific to iTrade and MHA. So I would not characterize that -- It's like this breakout of networks, right? I -- Yes, we've seen that consistently at DAT. It's truly a two-sided network where both sides incrementally gain more value as the size of network improves. ConstructConnect, iTrade, for example, is what we'll call one-sided networks where we need sort of the anchor tenants. In ConstructConnect, which is the general contractors, and then -- In iTrade, the retailers to be in the network. And then it drives supply chain efficiency through. So we've seen just good solid execution across those businesses. So it's not -- it has a network effect but it's not one where -- it's driven because of the execution of the software and the sales and the distribution capabilities of the business. On MHA, this is a group purchasing organization. They've continually done a great job of retaining their customers, adding customers, adding new products to the portfolio that our providers -- health care providers can buy. And then there's what we call compliance activities, both Rob and I called it out. This is where you're just constantly monitoring and make sure that both sides of the network pay what they need to pay the network. And there's a large amount of that activity in the quarter, so it's nice to see that.
Operator: And with JPMorgan, we'll hear from Steve Tusa.
Pat Baumann: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is actually Pat Baumann for Steve Tusa. Quick follow up to Deane's question on the bridge on your organic raise. Can you bridge us on the EPS raise for the year as well to $0.65 at the midpoint?
Rob Crisci: Sure. So the $0.41 discrete tax item we mentioned, if you look at M&A, we've got around $0.07 or so net of incremental M&A. While we had the -- call it around $0.14 for Foundry, as Neil mentioned, we lost $0.02 or $0.03 from the Imaging transaction closing sooner than expected. That actually hit in the first quarter, and then there's around $0.05 for the Gatan shipments, so they're slipping to the period where we don't expect to own the business anymore. So if you net all of that together, you get $0.07. And then the remainder, $0.17 or so, that's your, sort of, just better operations, better operations, better margins and better organic growth throughout the portfolio.
Pat Baumann: Got you. That's really helpful. And then maybe circling back to, a lot of, obviously, commentary on Deltek given the comments from that large company. You said it was up high single digit organically in the quarter. Just wanted to kind of step back. And if you could offer some perspective on how is that business grown organically since you bought it back in 2016? I think you were kind of alluding to a high single-digit type growth rate but just wanted to confirm that. And then on...
Neil Hunn: No. That's right.
Rob Crisci: Yes, it's been high single-digit organic since we bought it, which is better than we expected. We expected mid-single.
Neil Hunn: Yes. And I, we highlighted that when we talked about, the Deltek SaaS migration has resulted in that high single digit growth since we've owned it.
Pat Baumann: Yes. Yes. And then also just wondering have you guys done any deals there since acquiring it? Just curious what kind of deals you've done to try to bolster the business if at all.
Neil Hunn: There's been a couple of bolt-ons. Now the high single digit we talked about is organic, right, so the growth there is not...
Rob Crisci: It's quite a bit higher if you include the M&A that we've done.
Neil Hunn: Exactly.
Rob Crisci: We've done several acquisitions also that add to that business.
Neil Hunn: Small tuck-ins generally characterized as products that can be sold to the existing customer base. We've talked about ConceptShare and Workbook in the past to name a couple.
Pat Baumann: So what is the revenue base now if you don't mind sharing some color on that?
Rob Crisci: We don't like to give exact revenue numbers on our businesses, but I think we said it would be $550 million. The first year we owned it, it's way over $100 million on top of that $550 million.
Operator: Next is Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Lee Sandquist: This is Lee Sandquist on for Julian. You highlighted double digit SaaS growth in application software. How big is the SaaS business today? And secondly, could you just provide a little bit of color about the margin differential here versus other software models in your own portfolio?
Neil Hunn: So I'll take the first part of this then let Rob follow-up. So we talked about the double-digit SaaS at Deltek. I just, I want to be clear in our commentary there, that's not a broad Roper statement. And I'll let Rob talk about the percentage of the total revenue of Roper that's software and SaaS.
Rob Crisci: Yes. I mean where we sit today of the software revenue is pretty evenly split from a SaaS subscription model and a license on-prem model, and that's been moving more towards SaaS and we expect that to continue. But as we sit here today, the business models are roughly the same, about even. And then as we've talked about in the past, EBITDA, software EBITDA for Roper is an excess of 50% at this point in time.
Lee Sandquist: Okay. And then compressor controls has put together several nice quarters in a row now. How far below peak are we? And then secondly, how large is the LNG exposure since you called it out in that business?
Rob Crisci: Yes. So compressor controls is historically a late-cycle business, so it just bottomed out later than the rest of the oil and gas businesses, and it has begun growing since sometime late last year. And I think it's an opportunity there with a lot of, Neil mentioned there's a lot of LNG opportunities out there that we expect to get our fair share of. So this business is the size that is roughly 20% of our Process Technologies segment, so I think those upsides, sort of tailwind opportunities that are exciting. But again, it's a recently small part of the overall Roper portfolio and a small part of the segment.
Neil Hunn: Yes. And I would add. It's obviously highly indexed LNG, it's what they do. But it's not just tied to new. I mean there's a lot of retrofit Brownfield activity as well that they consistently add channel capacity to identify and the capability to drive upgrades there.
Operator: And we'll hear from Robert McCarthy with Stephens.
Robert McCarthy: Hi. This is Robert McCarthy on for Robert McCarthy. How are you today?
Rob Crisci: Thank you for joining us.
Robert McCarthy: Well I think a lot of people were tapped in and across a lot of land lines right now, also bunch of different calls. So one thing I wanted to catch up on in all seriousness is -- and I apologize if I missed this in your prepared remarks. What is the update you can provide with respect to Gatan and the potential divestiture there?
Laurence Hunn: So the update is, as we talked about, it's in our guidance through the end of the second quarter. We're in, along with Thermo, we've been working through the regulatory process with the U.K. CMA. And we're hopeful that concludes here at the end of the second quarter.
Robert McCarthy: Okay. So you're still confident that this can be done?
Laurence Hunn: Certainly. There's lots of resources working on clearing the CMA objections.
Robert McCarthy: Okay. Thank you for that color. And then maybe you could talk about -- I think you mentioned -- Is it Harold Flynn?
Laurence Hunn: Yes.
Robert McCarthy: Yes. Maybe you could just amplify kind of what he's going to bring to the table and talk about his background, his experience and what you're really looking for? Two or three key things that you think that's really going to help you kind of use him to enhance the governance and kind of coaching across the platform.
Laurence Hunn: Sure. So first, what is the role of the Group Executive here, right? The role is to help coach both the company's to become great and achieve greatness and help the leaders in the businesses become great leaders, right? And we think about that across many dimensions, but 3 principal ones are how do you develop strategy? We want that to be very much outside in and focus on answering 2 questions: Where to play and how to win. We care a lot about how that strategy is executed. We want it to not be a project of the leadership team's of the companies. We want it to be process enabling and -- so that it can endure a long period of time. Third thing is we care a lot about how our teams develop their talent, engage their talent and run a talent offense. And so the group executive layer is focused on those 3 things: strategy, strategy the deployment and talent, broadly speaking, in addition to the day to day and week to week things that come up. So Harold, and it's not just Harold, but in the product businesses, Chris and Jeff that I mentioned, their job is to do that. And Harold's case, and I would say this is a case for all of our group people, they're very growth and process oriented. They have a strong orientation towards talent, they're super strong cultural fit. They're probably nothing more important in our vetting exercise here. We're only 50 people in this office or 55 people in Sarasota. There's only a handful of these group executives, and we need that cultural fit to be really tight, which it is with Harold. And then the thing about Harold and, again, I wouldn't isolate him, Satish is this way, and the other team as well is -- I would consider them sort of learning executives. So they're constantly learning and adapting their style and understanding what Roper is about, right? We want to Roperise them and have them take the Roper governance system out to the companies.  And then certainly, to be successful here, you have to be financially savvy. That's how I characterize the role and Harold and the team that he works with.
Robert McCarthy: If I can just sneak one more in since I showed up in person. Maybe you could just talk about level setting our expectations for more acquisitions in terms of firepower, opportunity set? And maybe if you could comment on the pricing of assets in the competitive environment.
Laurence Hunn: Okay. So as Rob and I both mentioned, Foundry is just the beginning. We have a very strong balance sheet. We've worked hard to get the balance sheet to be offensively positioned, which it clearly is, and so we're, we feel great about that. The pipeline, we said it now for several quarters, it's very robust. The quality of the assets is quite high. As you know, we're always trying to buy things that are a little bit better than what we are. It's been the hallmark of our strategy for a long period of time.  So relative to the pricing, with the assets we want, the things that have all the defensive characteristics and network characteristics, great management teams, the negative net working cash flow, mid- to high single-digit organic growers, low capital intensity, those assets are not inexpensive. But in our CRI orientation, there's always value to be gained by our shareholders by deploying capital against those type of assets. So we feel very good about it. We feel very confident about our future here for that type of plan.
Rob Crisci: And on the balance sheet, I think we both mentioned in our comments earlier that the balance sheet is very well positioned, so in the low 2s from a net debt-to-EBITDA standpoint, we're obviously deeply committed to investment grade, but we also have TTM EBITDA approaching $2 billion. So we also have $700 million that would come in as the Gatan deal closes. So with or without that $700 million, we could easily deploy $1.5 billion or more on M&A whenever the opportunity arises.
Neil Hunn: Yes. And from a competitive situation, I would say it's largely unchanged. If there is a super strategic that's going to bear a lot of synergies, we are not and have never been a viable competitor for that target. We're almost always the feedstock of candidate targets for us. It principally come out of private equity. And then at the finish line, we're normally competing against private equity. And so in the asset that we described where the management teams are builders and growers and are attracted to our model, we tend to compete and win at a very high clip when all the things line up.
Robert McCarthy: Congrats on the quarter.
Operator: And we'll hear from Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company.
Joe Giordano: So I think when you announced Foundry, when you go through the financials of it, it clearly fits the profile, but I think there was at least some thought of, okay, now we're getting into Pixar and some things that we're not used to. Can you maybe just talk about how you guys conceptualize these things internally? As, there almost seems like there is no bridge that's too far when you're looking at it strictly from a financial standpoint, but how do you get comfortable with key man risk at those individual businesses and your ability to be able to run those businesses in that kind of framework, things like that.
Neil Hunn: Sure. So I might have misunderstood a part of that question, but I'll just, I'll clarify so it's on the record. So it's not a bridge too far financially. So these are always...
Joe Giordano: No. Definitely not. It's definitely not. It's not just financial.
Neil Hunn: Okay. Now I understand. So we'll go through our process, right. So the processes is does it meet our CRI thresholds, yes or no? This one clearly does. Then it's about does the management team, are they going to really thrive in our environment? And an easy simple way to think about that is are they fundamentally about, intrinsically motivated about building their business? So when engaged with this team, which we are able to do a couple of times before the process started, it's very clear that this team is completely passionate about what they do. They've been doing it for a very long period of time. The technology officers in this business actually have personal awards for what they've done in this animation sort of compositing space. And so they are built-for-purpose for this business. Then we get into is it a business we like and that's, is it in a niche? Is it a leader, network effects, all the things we've been through many, many times. And so one of the things we did as a team think through is, hey, it's meeting all these criteria, but is it -- does it do something that's sort of sexy? And do we not like it because of that? And at the end of the day, because it meet -- met all their criteria so perfectly, we're like, "Hey it's a software business at the end of the day." And what they do is they do things that you can see on HBO and other places unlike things, the other things in Roper. But it's really, at the end of the day, a pretty boring software business.
Joe Giordano: Is there maybe -- if I ask that a different way, without naming anything specific obviously, are there examples that you could tell us of companies that have met the financial criteria? But when you guys get in the room, you're like, Do we really even understand what's going on here at this business and maybe we're not the right owners?
Laurence Hunn: All the time, right? And so we see scores of our amazing CRI businesses, and then when we start doing the work, I would say the number 1 reason we walk away if it meets our financial criteria is just the management team. For one reason or another, they're not just about builders, so there's not good chemistry or worry that they're going to leave in a short period of time. And then if you're still comfortable there, if there's a product that we're worried about, could there be -- if there's -- if we view there's any sort of 0 in the Monte Carlo analysis, then we generally are walking away, right? Being long-term owners, we don't want to onboard any of that risk. So we spend a lot of time around that.
Rob Crisci: And if we don't yet know the industry well, we do a ton of work around the industry with outside consultants, and there's a lot, a lot of work that goes on. There's many readouts. And if anything scares us away, we just say no, and we walk away. And that happens all the time.
Operator: And we'll next hear from Joshua Aguilar from Morningstar.
Joshua Aguilar: Hey guys. Can you hear me?
Laurence Hunn: Yes good morning. 
Joshua Aguilar: Hey. How are you doing? Hey. We were -- So I wanted to go back a little bit to the annual contract value because I think you recently said at a conference that you've been reporting 50% higher annual contract values in ConstructConnect in just the first year and 1.5 years of ownership alone. And so some of the internal debate we had was really around was this more to -- maybe perhaps they were underpricing their product at that time? Or were you looking to the cover of the cost of the purchase sooner? Or where would you push back on the -- somebody who would insert something like that?
Laurence Hunn: Yes. So I appreciate the question on ConstructConnect. So I think we talked about a couple of times in the past, ConstructConnect, again to set the context is our network that connects general contractors and subcontractors to building product manufacturers in its large network. And the strategy since we've owned this business since the fourth quarter of '16 has been to basically drive habitualization of the core product to the contractor community. And to do that, we had to actually build, and we've work to do this, a number of software elements that go on top of and interlink with the contents that we have. And so the increase in revenue per user at ConstructConnect are early gains of our new product launches because we just have more value to sell is what it is. So it's not the construct, like you said, that try to cover our purchase price or anything like that. It's just the continuation of the strategy and the commitment we have to the long-term ownership of the assets.
Joshua Aguilar: Great. Thanks for that. And then I guess a little bit on TransCore. You were talking about that being more of a nationally interoperable solution coming online this year. Is -- how's -- what's the progress there? And maybe you can give me a little bit of insight there if that's okay.
Laurence Hunn: I think it's quite good. I think that's a -- that can reflect in the recent wins we've had and the tolling projects that are ongoing. It's been good execution by the team.
Joshua Aguilar: And last one for me, sorry about that. In terms of just the organic growth guidance, is that just a function of the lower end of process solutions, sorry, Yes, process solutions just kind of moving up? Or is there something else there that I should be looking at in terms of the segments?
Rob Crisci: Yes. I think it's a combination of that and the combination of the outperformance in the first quarter, building that into the full year numbers. Maybe a little bit net, more good guys than bad guys if you look everywhere else. But that's the majority of it.
Operator: We'll next hear from Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.
Alex Blanton: What was the dollar amount you paid for Foundry? You could give it in pounds, but I want to know what it was in dollars.
Rob Crisci: Yes. If converted to $530 million or so in dollars. $535 million in dollars.
Alex Blanton: $535 million. Okay. And on compressor controls, you mentioned that it's well below the peak. Is that right?
Rob Crisci: Certainly, if you look at the performance of the business over the past several years, they're just sort of on the way back up given the fact there was no new construction for several quarters, and now the new construction business is starting to come back. As Neil mentioned, they've done well in retrofits and Brownfield activity and doing a great job of covering their install-base and doing a lot of great things for customers. But the new construction projects are just now starting to ramp up with LNG taking the lead.
Alex Blanton: How much is that of the total? When that, When you acquired that business in 1992, most, almost all the business was retrofit because none of the OEMs were using software. People would buy the compressors using the OEM software, and then they would retrofit it with CCC. So, But it sounds to me like that has changed and that you're getting a lot of business now with the OEMs delivering your software with their compressors. Is that the case?
Neil Hunn: Yes. So Alex, I would say that the team over many years has built, it's an incredible capability of getting into this feed and getting this getting prefeed and really speccing projects very, very, very early. It's, as you know, it's a multiple year process to get spec'd in these new projects. It's a true core capability of that business now.
Alex Blanton: And what percentage is pipeline? You used to do a lot of business on gas pipelines. In fact…
Rob Crisci: It's, Yes. It's a pretty small percentage. I don't have the exact number, but it's pretty small.
Alex Blanton: Because when you acquired the business, the first huge contract you got was to equip Gazprom pipeline with your stuff. So that's pretty small now in relation to the total?
Rob Crisci: Yes.
Operator: And we'll end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to Zack Moxcey for closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participation, you may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-01 07:30:00) =====
Operator: The Roper Technologies Fourth Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Zack Moxcey.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the fourth quarter and full year financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are; Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O’Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier, this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today’s call. We have prepared slides to accompany today’s call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now, if you will please turn to slide 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today’s call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release, and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today’s call in the context of that information. And now please turn to slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the fourth quarter and year, primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenue; a deferred tax benefit resulting from the held-for-sale classification of the Scientific Imaging businesses; a measurement period adjustment to 2017 provisional income tax amounts resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and lastly a one-time expense for accelerated vesting related to the passing of Brian Jellison. And now if you'll please turn to slide 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. During today's call we'll go through our Q4 and FY 2018 enterprise financial results. We'll then turn to our 2018 segment detail and our 2019 segment outlook. We'll then turn to our 2019 guidance and then take your questions. Next slide please. This is really a fantastic quarter. Revenue, EBITDA, net earnings, cash flow really any measure you can look at was a record for both the quarter and the full year. Revenue increased 12% to $1.38 billion with organic growth of 9%. Gross profit increased 13% with margin expanding 90 basis points to 63.5%. Of note gross margins were increased in all four of our segments. EBITDA increased 12% to $496 million and EBITDA margins expanded 30 basis points to 36%. Earnings before taxes increased 14% and DEPS increased 19% to $3.22 in the quarter. Operating cash flow increased 26% to $464 million, an astounding 34% of revenue. Free cash flow increased 27% to $447 million, 32% of revenue just eye-popping cash flow. Before we turn to the next slide we want to highlight a few topics. Relative to cost push inflation tariffs, the impact across our businesses in the quarter was modest and manageable, which is clear with our gross margins expanding 90 basis points to 63.5%. Pricing actions already in effect offset most of the supply chain impact but the teams also quickly repositioned certain elements of the supply chains to minimize the tariff impact. Also during the quarter, we had the opportunity as we do every year to spend multiple hours with each of our businesses to discuss and challenge their forward strategy; discuss market trends, customer behaviors and competitive activity; talk through their enablement and execution of strategy; and review the teams' activities regarding talent development. So as we look back on 2018 and Q4, it was a very good quarter, a tremendous year and another proof point that our strategy works. As a reminder, we have a portfolio comprised of modest-sized business that all have a niche orientation and market leadership position. When you combine that with an org structure that promotes close customer agency and nimble execution and have a widespread cultural orientation aligned on cash returns, great things can happen as they have this quarter and this year. And as we turn to the next page, I want to take a moment to thank our teams around the world for a tremendous 2018. Next page. As we look at the Q4 P& L, we would just like to highlight the tremendous leverage from the top of the P&L all the way down to DEPS. Revenue grew organically 9%, EBITDA increased 12%, earnings before taxes increased 40% and DEPS grew 19% just tremendous execution by the teams. Next page. We'll discuss our Q4 segment results starting in the upper left with our RF Technology & Software segment which in the quarter represented 43% of our revenue. Revenue increased 18% to $590 million. Operating profit increased 19%. Operating margins expanded to 29% in the quarter. And EBITDA increased 19% to $229 million, which represented 38.8% of revenue. It's always good, when your largest segment grows the fastest. The strength was across the group. We saw all our software businesses perform very well, Deltek, DAT, Aderant CBORD, iTrade, ConstructConnect. TransCore grew as expected. Late in the quarter, we acquired a small business Avitru for about $90 million. We'll be integrating this business within our Deltek business. Avitru is a clear leader in commercial construction specifications, content and software space. This product enables architects and engineers to select the correct and appropriate building specifications during the design process. Avitru has an exclusive partnership with the American Institute of Architects and has over 48 customers most of which are architects and engineers. As a reminder Deltek has a leading A&E enterprise application software franchise. 95% of Avitru’s revenue is recurring and they're in the midst of a cloud migration. So this is a nice tuck-in for Deltek. It allows for better channel exposure for Avitru and broader A&E customer base for Deltek to sell into. Now turning to our Medical & Scientific Imaging segment. Revenue increased 9% in the quarter to $402 million, operating profit grew 9%, operating margins were flat in the quarter and EBITDA grew 7% to $170 million. Similar to last quarter, it was quite strong across the board. Medical product businesses grew nicely in the quarter. Our medical application software businesses performed well and cameras and Gatan also performed well. Turning to our Industrial Technology segment. Revenue increased 8% to $223 million. Operating profit grew 15%, operating margin expanded 220 basis points and EBITDA increased 14% to $74 million which represented 33.4% of revenue, really capped-off a tremendous year for this segment. Neptune continued to perform extremely with continued market share gains and Cornell and Roper Pump saw their strength continue. And finally, our Energy Systems & Controls segment which represented just 12% of our business in the quarter grew 1% to $162 million, operating margins grew 11%, operating margins grew 320 basis points and EBITDA grew 9% to $61 million, which represented 37.7% of revenue. As we highlighted last quarter, we expected a bit slower seasonal Q4 ramp across these businesses. Given the volatility of oil late in the quarter, the Q4 seasonal ramp was a touch slower than anticipated, but the teams did a fantastic job managing margins in the quarter. So a year ago, when we presented this slide we talked about our need to consider rethinking our segments. Throughout the year, we've done work on this and are close to finalizing our approach, which we expect to do so within the first quarter. As a reminder, this exercise is solely focused on how we re-segment our business, not how we operate our enterprise. Now I'll turn it to Rob to discuss our P&L, our cash flow and our balance sheet. Rob? 
Rob Crisci: Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for waking up an hour earlier than normal to hear our call. So, on page 8, I'll go over the full year income statement. As Neil mentioned, it was an excellent 2018. We grew revenue 11%, which is more than $500 million for the year. The majority of the growth was organic, with full year organic growth of 8% and 9% organic in each of the last three quarters. At Roper, as you know, we pride ourselves in the ability to grow both organically and through our consistent deployment of capital. And in 2018, we really benefited from both, with the robust organic growth and positive contributions from PowerPlan and our other acquisitions. Our margins also expanded for the year. Gross margin, up 60 basis points. EBITDA margin, up 30 basis points for overall EBITDA growth of 13%, exceeding $1.8 billion for the first time, so we had very nice leverage on the growth. Earnings before taxes grew 15% for the year. As you will recall, from a year ago Q4 call, we talked about the many benefits from tax reform for Roper. And that certainly did play out, as you see our full year tax rate declined from 28.9% to 21.5%. So adding up all those numbers, we grew our DEPS for the year 25%. Next slide. At Roper, we always believe that cash is the best measure of performance. And in Q4, we grew our free cash flow, as Neil mentioned, 27% to $447 million. And on a full year basis, we grew our operating cash flow 16% and our free cash flow 17% to a record of $1.37 billion, which represents 26% of revenue. As you can see on the chart on the right, if you look at the last years of free cash flow, we compounded 19% which is very consistent with our long-term track record of double-digit cash flow compounding, and we feel really good about our ability to continue to do that in the future. Next slide. So turning to the first of our two balance sheet slides. Driven by our asset-light business model, we ended the fourth quarter with working capital to revenue of minus 3%, completing our second consecutive year of negative net working capital. As you can see on the chart on the right, our deferred revenue continued to increase, aided by seasonal software billing as we continued to grow our recurring revenue. So I thought I'd take a few short moments and sort of talk about why we think negative working capital is so important. So if you assume a $500 million increase in revenue, which was similar to Roper's 2018 growth, a multi-industry company with a higher working capital level, let's say, 10% of revenue, would actually consume $50 million of cash on their balance sheet in order to grow that $500 million in revenue. To contrast for the same amount of growth, not only does Roper not consume cash on the balance sheet, we actually generate $15 million of incremental cash due to our negative net working capital. So we really view the asset-light model as very, very valuable and it accelerates our ability to compound cash in the future. And we certainly expect to remain negative and become more negative over time. Next slide. So this slide is our balance sheet slide. Looking at our strong financial position and comparing where we were at the year-end 2017 to where we are in the year-end of 2018. And we think it's very notable that we reduced our gross debt during the year by a little over $200 million while at the same time we increased our EBITDA by $200 million. So ending the year, our gross debt-to-EBITDA is down to 2.7 times. Our net debt-to-EBITDA is down to 2.5 times. So it's really a testament to Roper's ability to consistently and quickly generate cash and free cash flow that we can reduce leverage in a year where we deployed $1.3 billion in high-quality exciting software acquisitions. So if you look at our balance sheet ending the year, we are very well-positioned to deploy capital and take advantage of our attractive pipeline of acquisition opportunities moving forward through 2019. So with that, I will turn it back to Neil to go over the rest of the presentation.
Neil Hunn: Thanks Rob. If I can turn to RF Technology & Software, slide 13, we'll go through and recap this segment and the next three segments for the review of 2018. We can see in the upper left the segment really had fantastic financial performance in the year. Revenue plus 13%, operating profit plus 17%, core margins expanding and EBITDA growing 16%, really a fantastic year. Importantly the segment organic growth was 6% but inside of that our software businesses grow organically 8%. As we start with Deltek and remind you Deltek is our applications software business focused on the government contracting and professional services firm market space, they grew high single-digit revenue with tremendous cash performance in the year. We break it apart. On the GovCon side in the Deltek business, the scale benefits that we have continued. There are market share gains across both the enterprise or the large side of the government contracting space as well as the small and medium-sized business. On the professional services side for Deltek, the year was highlighted by the launch of VantagePoint and we'll talk to this in a minute about the importance of that. And then we saw early traction in niche professional services end markets specifically consulting and accounting firms. Across both businesses Deltek is in a SaaS migration and for this and many of our software businesses this SaaS migration is a growth driver. Turning to our Freight Match business, which is our full truckload spot market network business just a record year from this enterprise based on network expansion and favorable end market conditions. The network expanded due to net subscriber adds, but importantly the vitality of the network also was increased by the ARPU or the revenue per unit increasing for two reasons. First, because we're able to capture better pricing based on the value for the network from our customers as well as launched a few smaller products that we cross-sell into for solutions stack our customers. As we turn to Aderant, Aderant is our law firm application software business. Deane and her team did a tremendous year continuing to gain share from our primary competitor and grew double digits, fantastic job there. iTrade, which is our perishable food supply chain software and network business, grew mid-single digits with solid margin expansion. The team there did a nice job, advancing the products features and improving the tech stack. Great job and we expect great things to come from that team going forward. ConstructConnect's preconstruction network strengthened and they quite dramatically expanded their solution set. TransCore toll and traffic saw strength from its back office service and software operating and tolling project execution. Importantly the back office software and service they are proving -- TransCore is proving to be quite differentiated from the competition. And importantly that business comes with high recurring revenues and better CRI performance. And also in the year, we acquired PowerPlan in the second quarter another high-quality niche application software business very Roper-like business. And the team there did a great job on-boarding into our culture and is off to a great start. Looking back over 2018, it was a great year in terms of innovation and that should provide momentum as we head into 2019 and beyond. A few highlights to include, Deltek launching VantagePoint. This SaaS product opens new niche markets for Deltek, consulting, accounting et cetera. But also overtime enables a back-end consolidation of several platforms into a single tech stack. This provides the ability to put more features into their products, cross-sell more new products and drive back in efficiencies. Aderant entered the year with essentially one offering, large law. They exited the year with three SaaS recurring revenue offerings in addition to the core large law products. Organically, Aderant developed and launched a mid and small law SaaS practice management ERP solution. In addition, Aderant on-boarded, integrated and started cross-selling two small bolt-on acquisitions. One focused on the law firm knowledge management space and the other focused on billing preparation and management. When combined these three new product offerings are building a meaningful SaaS recurring revenue business within Aderant. Finally, I'll highlight ConstructConnect. This team executed its product strategy and roadmap extremely well during the year. They designed, built and launched the first truly integrated construction planning to take-off and estimating solution in the market. They are core to Roper's strategies and innovation and it was a great year on that front. Now turning to our outlook for 2019, we expect this segment to grow 4% to 6% organically in the year, with a bit stronger growth with our software assets and a bit less with TransCore. Next slide. Now as we turn to our Medical & Scientific Imaging segment. This segment represented 29% of Roper's revenue in 2018. Revenue increased 8% in the year. Operating profit increased 7% in the year. Operating margins contracted 30 basis points, which is modestly better than we anticipated heading into the year. And EBITDA grew 5%. Importantly, segment organic growth was 7% in the year. We saw strong growth in execution in niche medical application software. Strata Decision had tremendous year. They were just voted for the fifth year in a row to be number one in KLAS for their category. For those who don't know KLAS is a Consumer Reports-type reporting organization that ranks health care IT vendors and again Strata was number one for the fifth year in a row. Importantly, they also acquired many new customers most notably the Cleveland Clinic and MD Anderson that they can add to the customer count today. CliniSys had a good year and we expect the momentum to continue with CliniSys. To remind you, CliniSys is our European laboratory information management business. They boast to 70% win rate on the projects they bid. And across Europe in the various geographies, we see laboratories consolidating. So given our win rate and our large footprint, we expect to benefit over many years as the European laboratory footprint consolidates. As we turn to our alternate site, growth there was led by our long-term care and home health solutions SoftWriters and SHP. And our U.S. Lab business declined as we expected. We saw rapid growth from our niche medical product businesses, specifically CIVCO, Northern Digital and IPA. We saw double-digit growth in Verathon based on strong demand from our new BladderScan technology and recurring revenue gains from our GlideScope Consumables. Importantly, Verathon reached a milestone in the GlideScope business line this year where the recurring revenue from the consumables outpaced that of instrument sales. So we expect very continued strong momentum in that business going forwards. Also Gatan's revenue contribution was fantastic on the delivery of their next-generation cryo-EM products. Just take a minute to thank Sander and Ed for their tremendous execution throughout the course of the year in terms of their new product development, their ability to deliver on their customer commitments all while this pending sale to Thermo was in the back of their minds. Great job to the team there. Just ending the year, we did announce the process of divesting our imaging businesses in two trenches. First, as you know, we have a pending sale of Gatan to Thermo. We expect this to close in the second half of the year once the regulatory review with the U.K. is completed. We also announced in December, sale of our remaining camera businesses to Teledyne for $225 million. We expect this divestiture to close in February. A couple of innovations worth highlighting with our medical group center on Verathon and SHP. Both should help continue our momentum into 2019 and beyond. As we look back, we celebrated Verathon's 10th year under Roper's ownership. It's very encouraging to see the high level of product vitality at Verathon. First, our new BladderScan product, which is enabled by AI-based algorithms, is established as the best product in terms of bladder volume measurement and accuracy and has the highest reliability performance characteristics. As we introduce this new BladderScan to the world, we are focused on upgrading our leading global market share to our new platform, as well as selling into new facilities and care settings. Next, there has been tremendous innovation in Verathon's GlideScope, our video laryngoscopy product line. Verathon recently launched a re-imagined cart-based system which does a fantastic job of providing upgraded optics and display technologies, while also doing a better job with the work flow components of the system. In addition, the team wants a handheld version of GlideScope during the year. Finally, Verathon launched just last month a new product category, a single-use bronchoscope called GlideScope BFlex. There's a very large global push by the market to use single-use versus reusable products due to cleaning challenges. Verathon plans to leverage their very large global GlideScope monitor base in which the new BFlex integrates. It is very early, but we're cautiously optimistic about this new product category. Another illustration of innovation on the software side is SHP. They've done a great job creating a new product targeted towards hospitals. As a reminder, SHP benchmarks 60% of every home health encounter in the U. S. on a nightly basis. If you're a hospital discharging patients, you discharge to either long-term care or the home care setting. Importantly, if a patient comes back to the hospital, the hospital is not reimbursed for follow-on services. To help hospitals manage this risk, SHP created discharge planning product to help hospitals ultimately discharge to either home health and/or managed home health patients during the recovery. As we look to our 2019 outlook, we expect this segment to grow between 4% and 6% organically for the year. Next slide. Our Industrial Technology Group which is 17% of Roper in 2018 grew 15% to $900 million. Operating profit grew 21%. Operating margin expanded 160 basis points. And EBITDA grew 19% and finished at $301 million for the year. Segment organic growth was 14%. We saw double-digit growth from Neptune, with continued share gains based on their customer-focused innovations. We also had a great year at Cornell and Roper Pump, driven by meaningful share gains. As we look at our Energy Systems & Controls segment, which is 12% of our revenue in 2018, the segment grew 19 – excuse me 9% to $600 million during the year. Operating profit grew 20% and operating margins expanded 270 basis points with EBITDA finishing at $197 million or 17% of revenue. Organically this segment grew 7% with strength in our upstream applications where we saw double-digit growth. CCC returned to growth from new construction projects and we saw broad-based growth in our industrial end markets. Turning to our outlook for both segments. We see low single digits in our industrial segment, which is based on continued Neptune growth, partially offset by upstream oil and gas applications. We see our Energy Systems & Controls segment flat to slightly down in 2019. Of note, we see difficult comps for the segment during the first half of the year. Let me remind you that oil and gas is less than 10% of our revenue with upstream being about one-third of that. Clearly these businesses had two very strong years. They are not a large part of our portfolio but certainly a cyclical part. Our field leaders remain generally positive and encouraged by January's results, but we think it's prudent to model these businesses somewhat cautiously in 2019 given an environment of heightened macro uncertainties. If oil prices remain stable and/or takeaway capacity constraints are cleared, our guidance for these businesses could prove conservative. Now, let's turn to our 2019 guidance. We believe the business is positioned for a strong 2019. As such we're establishing our full year adjusted DEPS guidance to be $12 to $12.40. Organic revenue is expected to be between 3% and 5%. Our guidance model assumes approximate 22% tax rate though there are tax planning strategies that may be able to lower this rate in the first half but that is outside of our current guidance model. Importantly this annual guidance includes a $0.25 headwind impact from the pending divestitures of imaging net of interest. We're establishing our Q1 adjusted DEPS of $2.74 to $2.80. Guidance excludes the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures. And specifically in our guidance model, we expect the Gatan divestiture to Thermo to close in the second half but in our guidance model it's in through the end of the second quarter, so Gatan is in for six months in our guidance model. And the pending Scientific Imaging camera businesses divestiture to Teledyne is expected to close this month. Next slide. As we look back on our year here, it was really a fantastic 2018. Our diversified niche market strategy continued to produce very strong results. We saw 8% organic revenue growth and very broad-based across all four of our segments. Gross margins increased 60 basis points and EBITDA margins increased 30 basis points. Free cash flow increased 17% to $1.37 billion or 26% of revenue. Importantly we are very well positioned for a great 2019. Our CRI discipline, our niche market leadership positions, innovation and high recurring revenue drive consistent and long-term cash flow compounding. Earlier this morning, we announced the addition of Satish Maripuri as a member of our executive team. Satish will focus his efforts on providing group leadership to a number of our software businesses. Satish has a long track record of building and growing a variety of software businesses. Perhaps most importantly, Satish deeply understand Roper, our model and our approach. He spent the past several months learning about Roper and is now starting to engage with several of our software businesses. So we're very excited to welcome Satish to the team. Turning to our future capital deployment. We're excited about 2019. Our balance sheet is super well positioned for a strong capital deployment year. The number of very high-quality assets we've seen in the last several months is encouraging, and our pipeline is quite full. Importantly, our CRI orientation and M&A processes help us identify the very best businesses. As we turn to questions, we want to remind everyone that what we do is very simple. We compound cash flow by running a portfolio of operating businesses that have market-leading positions in niche industries. We provide the business leaders with Socratic coaching about what great looks like relative to strategy, operations, innovation and talent development. We incent our management team based on growth and we have a culture of mutual trust and transparency. Finally, we take our excess free cash flow and deploy it to buy businesses that have better cash returns than our existing companies. These simple ideas will deliver powerful results. Now, let's open it up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] We take our first question from Deane Dray with Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Hey. You guys are throwing-off my biorhythms at such an early hour this morning.
Neil Hunn: Thank you for waking up early.
Deane Dray: Yes, sir. Hey. Just to start it off, and I wasn't planning on doing this, but I just feel it's important to recognize the passing of Brian. In my career, I've never called ever thought of anyone as a financial genius, but I think Brian was. And it just struck me is his legacy, his business model – that has the Roper business model, talent development all of that lives on. And I think you're seeing it in these numbers today and I just want to take a moment to say that.
Neil Hunn: We appreciate you saying that and agree with what you said.
Deane Dray: Terrific. All right. So business at hand just was interesting that with Deltek's exposure there wasn't any issue you didn't cite any issue with the government shutdown with all the projects. Do you see any effect there across your businesses?
Neil Hunn: So – the sort of bifurcate it with what we saw nothing obviously in last year and we look forward into this year. In the first part of January, at the top-end the enterprise side with GovCon it's completely business as usual. As you can imagine, they have gigantic teams and staffs and they can flow their staffs to where the work is. On the very, very bottom-end, the mom-and-pop we saw a little bit of a slowdown in booking activities. It's very, very small part of Deltek, but Deltek is highly confident that rebounds based on their experience from sequestration. All of that business was captured and then following couple of months. And so it was – we view it as a push, if anything and certainly not lost business. So, in the grand scheme of things very limited impact on the Deltek business relative to the government shutdown.
Deane Dray: Got it. That's good to hear. And then, Neil you gave a bit of a tease about the re-segmentation. This has been talked about for more than a year and it makes all kind of sense. Now, I'm not expecting you to disclose any real specifics here, but just conceptually how does this – will it look like in terms of putting alike businesses into similar segments like consolidating energy? Where do you think the benefits that come from this, please?
Neil Hunn: Yeah. I appreciate that. So just – every time we get asked about the re-segmentation, we just want to make sure everybody understands, it's just how we organize the businesses for reporting out to investors. It's not how we operate the business. It's not changing any of the business model characteristics. It's just for communication to our investors and shareholders. To that end, the design principles are quite simple and straightforward. We want there not to be segments based on end market orientation, as our strategy is not end market-oriented. We'll put like business models and segments and that will certainly have a segment structure that supports our long term multi-industry view of our strategy, as well as having a combination of products and software. But the confusion of having multiple types of products and energy across two different segments, that will all likely be streamlined and cleaned up in new segment reporting structure.
Deane Dray: All good to hear. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Julian Mitchell: Just – and I'll echo Deane's comments on Brian, of course. In terms of the guidance on organic sales, you just grew 9% in the fourth quarter organically. Big step down in the guide, so about 4% at the midpoint in Q1. Maybe just talk a little bit about the segments, obviously, leading that how steep a drop-off you're expecting in industrial and energy. And maybe any comments around the cadence of order intake in those two businesses in the recent months, as you said, amidst the oil price volatility.
Rob Crisci: Sure. Good morning. This is Rob. So, I think, in the two largest segments RF and medical, very consistent. I mean, these are mid single digit organic growth segments for the most part if you go back last year and we expect much of the same for 2019. I think you're right. I think for the industrial and energy segments, we do see a little bit lower growth than we saw last year clearly. And I think, Neil mentioned a few reasons for that earlier. Neil, you can probably expand.
Neil Hunn: Sure. If you look across the aggregate of our industrial and energy segments and outlook, basically you see Neptune and CCC up for the year. We see our upstream assets down. And everything else in aggregate, the bucket of everything else, is flattish across 2019. As I mentioned, the field is generally pretty upbeat and our January activities were modestly strong. And our approach on guidance is we all saw the volatility in December in oil prices in that market. We saw a slight, ever so slight impact on some of the Q4 seasonal shipments that we talked about earlier. We also have a difficult first half comp across our energy businesses in particular. So we've modeled Q1 down with only modest improvements in the balance of the year. But importantly if the takeaway capacity, the 3 million barrels that's scheduled to come online comes online, or oil prices stay where they are or increase, then there could be positive levers in our model here specifically to the upstream assets that we modeled down for the balance of the year.
Julian Mitchell: Thank you. And then, just my second follow-up around the medical business, maybe just give us some updates on what you expect from the U.S. lab business in 2019? And also just to confirm the delay on sale of Gatan that in no way I assume affects your capital deployment given how strong the balance sheet is?
Neil Hunn: I'll take that Gatan one first. No, I mean it doesn't at all. I mean, we're very active and have the balance sheet that Rob shared was -- it was looking through any impact of the divestiture of Gatan. So we're planning on being quite offensive to the extent that the targets present themselves. Relative to Sunquest, we expect it to be down in 2019, although less down in 2018. That's consistent with how we set the situation about this time last year about what next couple of years look like for Sunquest.
Julian Mitchell: Thank you very much.
Neil Hunn: Yeah, just to be clear for the U.S. part of Sunquest.
Julian Mitchell: Got it. Thank you.
Neil Hunn: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: And next we'll year with Oppenheimer with Christopher Glynn.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning to you.
Christopher Glynn: Good morning. Nice job. So good comments on Aderant and Deltek on the share gains and explanations there. I was also looking for an update on PowerPlan impact Roper's having, any new initiatives on pricing or sales organizations?
Neil Hunn: Well, we just -- it's still pretty early days with PowerPlan. They had a very busy year last year and a newer SaaS offering around lease accounting. So that had tremendous uptake given the accounting changes. So that little bit of a pig -- through the python in terms of getting all those implemented and they did a very good job, and that we ran them through our planning process. I thought their end market orientation was good. They're also -- we bought the company that was in the mid-innings of a SaaS transition. So they are quite busy in terms of upgrading their tech stack and just getting the first early implementations on the new stack with recurring revenue SaaS part of that business. So early days. But as we mentioned, they on-boarded fantastically well, and the team has acclimatized well to our governance model and our structure.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And then similarly for iTrade, you've had some pretty consistent growth there at least for a short bit here. Just wondering what delay of the competitive and market opportunity profiles is like and particularly outside the U.S. if that's starting to tap.
Neil Hunn: Well, iTrade is mostly a U.S. business. It's not exclusively U.S. but mostly U.S. From a competitive landscape point of view is one of the things we like a lot about our network businesses it is a supply chain network that has network scale that's larger than anybody else. And so the relative market share advantage that we have in that business is quite larger over the next largest competitor, and really haven't seen a meaningful challenger in that business for several years. Again it's the network scale. And then Rhonda and her team over the last 18 or 24 months have just done a great job on the product and the features and driving even more customer loyalty and uptake. It's always had a high recurring revenues and high retention rates, but now the ability to sell more value in the product stack is encouraging.
Christopher Glynn: Great. Thanks.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll next hear with Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa: Hi, guys. Good morning.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Steve.
Rob Crisci: Hey, Steve.
Steve Tusa: I have been up since 4 AM, went for run, so this is piece cake, no problem. I say move it up, let’s cut the wheat from the chaff.
Rob Crisci: Hunn didn’t run this morning, so you're a step ahead of Steve.
Steve Tusa: I'm actually joking, I actually broke my ankle on Sunday. So I am not really moving – move very much. So again, on a more somber note, our condolences obviously around Brian. I echo Deane's comments. I think he said it pretty well. So, sorry to hear about that guys. 
Neil Hunn: Appreciate it. 
Rob Crisci: Thank you, Steve.
Steve Tusa: I guess just the acquisition pipeline with all these kind of crosscurrents out there and with multiples coming in a bit. I mean, is this – it all, it is cycle timing it all enough to kind of change people's mentalities around deals at all or no not yet in valuations?
Neil Hunn: So, generally speaking, not generally, it's absolute. I think the fact that private valuations, you know we buy everything from private equity, lag any change in public and they also don't have the volatility of public. And so that's just an observed fact in the market. The other thing, I would say to that is valuations remain robust in the private markets. But the assets that we all come to – I think you all come to appreciate that we look for the niche orientation, the high retention rates, the mid to high single-digit growth, generally non-cyclicality high-recurring revenues. Those assets and high cash flow low to limited CapEx those command a higher price than your average company. And those are the type of businesses that we look for. So we continue to do that. The other thing which we always do, we do it with our Board, a few times a year as we go through models to say is it better to continue deploying through valuation environments or wait? And every time the mass says to continue deploy through because the compounding effect overwhelms any market timing you could possibly dream up. And so our strategy has been for the last five years to invest through the cycle and we'll continue to do that.
Steve Tusa: Okay. Is there – just one last one. Now that you're kind of running the show there, what's kind of the biggest challenge you see as far as maintaining this type of performance?
Neil Hunn: Well, the beauty of this business is that it's comprised of 50 businesses. And I won't go through all the things you know about their niche orientation, defensibility, the market share leading positions that we have and so. The cash flow generation side of this business is pretty stable and robust given the assets that we have in our org structure. I think there is certainly a challenge or an opportunity we have to continue to add planning rigor and strategy execution rigor and talent development rigor through that organization, through the organization which we'll continue to do. And I won't say, it's a challenge, but is certainly something that's obviously top of mind, we spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about how we deploy the capital, right? So we have process and rigor and CRI discipline that really minimize the likelihood of making mistakes. But Rob and myself and the entire team here spent a lot of time on that and continue to try to learn through our history and make sure that we do a good job relative to deploying capital going forward. So it’s how I do cash flow generation, cash flow deployment is how I think about what the job is and the challenges and opportunities associated with that.
Rob Crisci: But I would just add to that you guys you know, that's very institutionalized. I mean, everything that we are doing is consistent with what we've been doing for the last 15 years. Neil and myself obviously have been very heavily involved in all the M&A we've done in valuation and execution in the last six, seven years. So it is no change at all and what we've done in the past, and it will stay the same moving forward.
Neil Hunn: And maybe just one thing – I'm sorry, go ahead, Steve.
Steve Tusa: No, no, you go ahead. You go ahead.
Neil Hunn: Yeah. So the poor transcriptionist missed all of that. But the one thing I would say is that that it's a challenge that I just wake up everyday thinking about. As we get bigger, the concept, that complexly can creep in. It's certainly something that I spend a lot of time thinking about how at every turn we can avoid that, and really keep this thing simple, which is one or probably the single largest thing that Brian left for the legacy is -- what we do is just very simple and we'll continue to do that going forward and that's very top of mind.
Steve Tusa:  Well, it sounds you guys have too much money to spend and that's not a bad problem to have. I think there's a lot other companies that would like that problem. Thanks a lot.
Neil Hunn: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. 
Joe Ritchie: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Joe Ritchie: So I thought you did a nice job, Neil, of telling us about the different offerings that are now in place at both Deltek and Aderant. But can you maybe just delve into that a little bit more? What are the opportunities from those offerings? And how are you seeing that translating into growth over the next couple of years?
Neil Hunn: Well, I'll take it one at a time, maybe start with Aderant. The last four -- three or four, five years and the next several years, the large law market will continue to be viable growth driver for the business and all the legacy reasons why we've won, we think will continue. So as you think about building a recurring revenue business, you build it on top of that larger pieces. And so, while each individual piece of the recurring revenue piece that we talked about at Aderant earlier, by itself is small, when you stack it on top of an existing business, it can become pretty meaningful. And importantly, it extends your – the company is also working in it's R&D pipeline to add – to build bolt-on products that you can sell into large law and the mid and small law size practices. So it's just a concept of which we talk broadly about, the software business is about "solution stacking". So you spend a lot of money acquiring a customer, and hopefully selling them one or two products. And then as you – certainly, once you have the customer, it's much easier to sell them additional product, especially if they're fully integrated in with – excuse me, the existing products that they have. And so that strategy is specific, not specific to Aderant or Deltek, but ConstructConnect or DAT or iTrade. And so, we can certainly spend more time off line about it, but that's the way we think about growing the product strategies of these businesses.
Joe Ritchie: Yeah. Fair enough. And maybe just kind of following on just staying on RF Tech for a second. Obviously, that business has evolved a lot over the last several years. And how do you think about then the cyclicality of this business? Now that you're so much more of a software-oriented business, if we were to go into a downturn. How resilient do you think this business is?
Neil Hunn: Which business are you referring to?
Joe Ritchie: I was thinking about the whole segment. I mean, obviously, there's variety.
Neil Hunn: The RF segment.
Joe Ritchie: Yeah. The RF.
Neil Hunn: Yeah, sure. So the TransCore business which actually is a highly recurring – high recurring revenue business, I mean, yes, there are products that come in and out on any given year, but there's a huge base of recurring revenue there. But that continues to be smaller part of this segment as currently reported. Software has now become two-thirds and growing of the segment. So very, very high levels of recurring revenue. If you look at our RF Tech segment organically over the past several years, I mean, it's very, very consistent growth and that continues to tick upward over time as we've added more of these high quality software businesses. So it's really not cyclical at all in the segment at this point in time.
Joe Ritchie: All right, guys. Good to hear. And again I wish my condolences for Brian as well.
Neil Hunn: Appreciate that. Thank you.
Operator: We'll now hear from Robert McCarthy with Stephens.
Robert McCarthy: Good morning, everyone. Can you hear me?
Neil Hunn: Perfectly.
Robert McCarthy: All right. Crystal clear. Well, obviously I echo the nice things said about Brian, and I think you guys know that. I guess the first question I would have is, obviously, you've given a lot of airtime to this re-segmentation the kind of risk the more cyclical businesses of the portfolio. At some point does it become a situation where it's better in the spin or other hands? Because I just think about your management there they're managing through this, but they are perceived as probably lower growth more cyclical within the portfolio and they're not getting capital going forward. So how do you bridge the gap to keep them motivated, keep them incentivized given the context that clearly you're deemphasizing the strategic importance of this collection of businesses and what's kind of the end game here?
Neil Hunn: Well, I'll start with your last statement about deemphasizing the strategic importance. I would say we're absolutely not doing that. All of our businesses, even the energy businesses are in niches, they are clear leaders. Importantly they are tremendous cash machines, right? Their CRI performance in stunning and so these businesses are fantastic businesses. They do, obviously, have some cyclicality associated with them, but they are fantastic businesses, period, full stop. So there are strategy at the same. We have a collection of roughly 50 businesses. They generate the cash flow and we take all the cash flow and deploy to businesses that are better than the core. So, that's how I would summarize our feelings on that. 
Rob Crisci: Yeah, I mean there is a lot of investment in these businesses. As you know, it’s like we centralize investment and did it out, these businesses generate high margins and they are encouraged and they knew that. I think Neil talked about some of the innovations in every single one of our businesses is investing to grow. And that's why they have such great performance. So they are all very, very strategic in their own way.
Neil Hunn: Great example of that is both the Cornell and Roper Pump. We've talked now all year long about the share gains that they've had in 2018. Those are directly a result of the investments we made in the channel and the product in the last down cycle. So we were there when others weren't there. And so I think our ability to sort of with the long-term horizon of owning these businesses proves to be beneficial.
Robert McCarthy: Well, now that everybody is awake, I guess, the question I have about acquisitions is you guys have done a great job in acquisitions that’s clear and great job in terms of the core operations of the business. But to I think Steve's question earlier, I mean, how do you keep this performance off in context of capital deployment? Where do you think the risk is? I asked Brian these years ago and he said, really the risk is in -- if we buy company that does not equate the software, the code that we think it has or is it a question of market position. It wouldn't be a question of capital intensity, because the nature of the businesses that you buy are not going to have surprises with respect to what their CapEx or funding needs are. But could you just talk about kind of ring-fencing the risks around, CRI through the lens, where you look at acquisitions. And if you are going to miss where is it going to be in your relative assessment? Just thinking self critically.
Neil Hunn: Sure. So I'll just -- I'll answer your question through the lens of how we deploy capital, right? So the first step in that approach for us is, do we like the CRI performance, yes or no? That is analytical, objective and is not subject to any bias or interpretation. So before we engage or do any work, we know that it fits our financial criteria. I think most companies that are stretching, or they stretch the valuations and assume synergies that's not anywhere in our CRI map. And so we don't sort of romance ourself into the financial strategy of an acquisition. It straight CRI map. Second is do – what we think that management team will strive in our environment. And we can spend more time about this later, but essentially is, are they – do they love building businesses yes or no? You can actually somewhat objectively determined that based on, if they've been running that business across multiple owners, you look back their leadership CVs, and see if they've had three jobs in their career versus 20. You get a sense that they love building businesses or not. And then third, so after we know we like the financial performance, we know we have a management team that will strive then is it a business that we like? Is it niche leadership position or early market share advantage, recurring revenue, high retention rates et cetera? So it's not certainly far from impossible to make a mistake, but the rigor of the process really makes it hard to do so. And so the punch line of that where we have been disappointed in the past is would be summarized and maybe they were a little slower to grow early until our strategy prod tools sort of have time to take effect, but it's far from value destructive [ph] from our shareholders, because there's so much arbitrage value in the CRI map from the onset.
Robert McCarthy: Thank you for taking my questions. I appreciate it.
Neil Hunn: Thank you.
Operator: And from Baird we'll now hear from Richard Eastman.
Richard Eastman: Yes. Good morning, Neil, Rob, Zack.
Neil Hunn: Good morning.
Richard Eastman: Again, I'll definitely second all the closing comments and nice comments about Brian. He will be missed. Just a quick question around the ES&C business as well as the IT business, the incremental margins in both in the fourth quarter just exceeded the gross margin that those two businesses generate. And I'm curious, is that a mix issue in those two segments? Or how did they deliver that amount of leverage I guess?
Rob Crisci: Yeah. I mean, I think in the energy segment, you had 1% growth. So that's just sort of a small number since you asked. I think in the industrial businesses, look there is – we do have high contribution margins and so as you get late in the year and you're delivering a lot of product it's going to come through a pretty high contribution margin. So, certainly over time, it’s not going to be a 100%, but certainly for a quarter, you can have pretty strong incrementals.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Okay. And just I guess this is kind of plays into my second question here. Again, when I look at 2019 and I look at core guide of 3% to 5% for sales, if I add back the $0.25 that you have pulled out for Gatan and other imaging businesses I'm curious about the EBIT leverage you will be able to show for the year. Again, if I just add that back the EBIT leverage looks a lot like maybe 3% type of thing. So, I'm a little bit curious, if in your plan assuming Gatan and imaging businesses is most of the compounding effect in EBIT going to come from M&A this year with your guide around industrial businesses? Is that kind of how your plan picks up?
Rob Crisci: Yes, sure, yes. As you know, we don't include any acquisitions in guide. So this guide is strictly based-off of organic. We've got a lot of capital that we expect to deploy as long as the right opportunities are there. And so, at the end of the year, yes, the compounding will always be a combination of our organic growth and our M&A growth. In terms of the guide, we are assuming roughly 30% to 35% leverage on the growth overall, which is pretty consistent with the kind of long-term trends. I think as Neil mentioned in our base guidance, because we are assuming some declines in some of the upstream businesses, and there's going to be a little bit of delevering there and it will hurt you, whereas the software and the medical businesses generally leverage 40%. And so if you put it all together, you get something in the 30s for our baseline midpoint guidance, which we think is sort of a prudent approach at this point in time.
Richard Eastman: I see. Yeah, yeah. And then just last question, around Gatan, is there any chance you would share kind of that revenue forecast for 2019? I mean, I understand when you're taking it out, but as the numbers would suggest that Gatan kind of decelerates off of what apparently was a really good 2018? Is that correct and...?
Rob Crisci: Yeah. So I don't really want to get that specific on that, given the fact that we're currently trying to get it to closed, the regulatory. But I would say that from a seasonality standpoint, it's always stronger in the second half than in the first half. So I think it is true, we're not assuming a lot of growth in 2019 versus what was a very strong 2018.
Richard Eastman: I see. Okay. Okay, very good. Thank you.
Rob Crisci: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen. 
Tristan Margot: Hey, guys. Good morning. This is Tristan in for Joe. Thanks for taking the question. Neil, just a quick one. I was wondering if you changed anything this year in the way Roper sets its guidance, since really that was the first time you had to do this at the entire company level. I guess what I'm trying to get to is how conservative though your guidance is this year compared to the previous years.
Neil Hunn: Well, I'll give you a little bit of a process and turn over to Rob. Maybe he can add some color. So the process of setting this is the same process that we've gone through for the last four or five years. I've certainly been involved with it, but not at the helm, obviously. So the engagement with the company is going through all the plan reviews, doing the call downs in January, doing all the analytics, getting the market information. So it's the same process. I went through earlier about the – what the posture we're taking on our oil and gas businesses relative to Q1 and the outlook. So we believe if the market, the takeaway capacity comes online or oil prices stay where they are or go up, there could be some positive levers. But other than that it's generally the same approach. Rob, do you want to add?
Rob Crisci: Yeah. It's the exact same process we've done over the last 10 years. So we certainly view it as well-balanced.
Tristan Margot: Great. Thank you, guys.
Neil Hunn: Great. Thank you.
Operator: That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to Zack Moxcey for closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: The Roper Technologies Third Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. For your information today's conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Zack Moxcey. Please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the third quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now, if you'll please turn to slide two; we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, and in our press release, and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to slide three; today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to acquire deferred revenue; a onetime debt extinguishment charge; and lastly, a measurement period adjustment to 2017 provisional income tax amounts resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And now if you'll please turn to slide four, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?
Neil Hunn: Thanks, Zack and good morning everyone. Before going through today's agenda, we'd like to thank all of you who have reached out to express your support and concern for Brian, our Executive Chairman. On a personal note, I would like to thank Brian for his tremendous leadership and his long-term mentorship to me. I want to assure everyone it's business as usual here at the company which you'll see throughout today's presentation. We have a very deep and talented management team both in the field and here in Sarasota that is committed to the continued execution of our proven strategy. To that end, we recently promoted both, Rob Crisci, our CFO and John Stipancich, our General Counsel to Executive Vice President. These promotions are indicative of their past contributions to the enterprise and also their go-forward contributions to the team here at Roper. Our CIR based processes and disciplines are deeply embedded in our culture and we'll continue working to make Roper an even better company in the years to come. Now turning to today's agenda. We'll start with our Q3 enterprise results then turn to our segment performance and outlook followed by our guidance update and then we'll open up for questions. Next slide please. As we look at our Q3, 2018 enterprise highlights, it was really a fantastic quarter. Record results with revenue, EBITDA, net earnings, cash flow and virtually any financial category that you can look at. Revenue grew 13% to $1.32 billion with organic revenue growth of 9%. We saw double-digit revenue growth across all four segments, really just fantastic performance and very broad execution. Gross profit grew 14% with gross margins expanding 80 basis points to a record 63.8%. When you look at gross profit gross profit margins, it really highlights the power of our niche strategy and our team's ability to nimbly execute through the quarter. As we look at this margin, there was very little impact of tariffs or any cost push inflation that flowed through our numbers. It was really just spectacular performance across the board relative to our margins. EBITDA grew 16% to $473 million. EBITDA margins expanded 100 basis points to 35.8%. Importantly, we saw double digit EBITDA growth and margin expansion across all four segments. Earnings before taxes, grew 18% to $411 million DEPS grew 31% to $3.09 and free cash flow grew 34% to $404 million or 31% of revenue. So as we look at the quarter, we're certainly delighted with the breadth of the performance, but also like the top to bottom leverage. You can see that revenue grew 13%; gross profit grew 14%; EBITDA plus 16%; earnings before taxes 18%; DEPS 31%; free cash flow 34%; leveraged all the way from the top to the bottom, really a fantastic result. Now I'll turn it over to Rob to take us through the income statement.
Robert Crisci: Thank you, Neil. Good morning everyone. So, on the next slide, we have our Q3 income statement metrics, a little bit more detail on some of the numbers that Neil had outlined on the previous slide. On revenue, our results with a 13% overall growth and 9% organic growth, we exceeded importantly $1.3 billion in the quarter for the first time and we remain on track for double-digit revenue growth this year, our margins up, 80 basis points, our gross margins up 100 basis points, our EBITDA margin. As Neil mentioned, EBITDA margin expansion across all four of our reporting segments and 16% EBITDA growth overall. Again we like to point out that the growth this year in earnings before tax as many of you know, we are a company that benefits quite a bit from the recent tax reform, but even setting that aside, we're able to grow our earnings before tax at 18% in the quarter, a very nice results. And that if you carry that down to the DEPS line, we grew 31%. I would note on the tax rate for the quarter of 21.5%. That was a little bit better than we expected coming into the quarter. We would expect to be right around 23% for Q4 and that number is embedded in our guidance. Next slide please. The next slide is an important slide to Roper, the cash flow slide. It really was an outstanding cash flow quarter, excellent growth of 32% operating cash flow and importantly an increase of over $100 million in cash flow versus last year. On the free cash flow line, $404 million of free cash flow. As you see here $418 million of operating cash flow converts to $404 million of free cash flow, the first quarter that we've exceeded $400 million in free cash flow and that's really a testament to our asset light model with very little CapEx and the ability to really generate a lot of cash as we continue to compound. On the full year basis, we certainly expect to be double digit cash flow growth. We're now up to 12% year-to-date versus last year and operating cash flow at $966 million year-to-date. Next slide. Again another important slide for Roper especially is our asset-light business model networking capital slide. So as of 9/30/18, you can see on the column on the right, our inventory 4.4% of revenue; receivables 16.6% of revenue; payables and accruals 11.5%; and importantly the deferred revenue number up to 11.7%. If you net all those together, you see once again negative networking capital for the company minus 2.2%. So we always like to look back at a little bit of a longer-term trend here really if you can see Roper's transformation over time. So if we look back to five years ago on September 30 of 2013 we had inventory of 6%, receivables of 18%, payables and accruals of 11.5% very similar to this quarter, but deferred revenue was only 6%. So if you have to 9/30/13 to today you can see a massive increase in our ability to generate cash and working capital and that's massively negative working capital that we expect to continue. So on our deferred revenue basis, we had about $212 million of deferred revenue back in 2013 that's now up to $620 million in 2018, and we expect that number to continue to increase moving forward. Next slide. So as far as strong financial position, well, one of our guiding principles are our capital structure here in Roper is to always be opportunistic on when we access the bond market. As you know, we're more committed to investment grade and we always want to make sure our leverage are - is at reasonable levels. And we're able to go ahead and complete a bond offering in mid-August and what's really a good environment with the 10-year treasury a little bit below 2.9%. So we completed 1.5 billion bond offering pretty close to evenly split between five and 10. And as part of that we decided to go ahead and redeem our 2019 6.25% notes a little bit early, so that did result in a $16 million one-time debt extinguishment charge in the quarter. As we look at that decision the is very attractive versus waiting to commit to next year in a rising interest rate environment, so we think the breakeven there was really kind of a no-brainer going ahead to do that. So we did that and we're happy with the result of the offering. So where we sit today now is $4.1 billion of bonds that's after our October 1st maturity where the bonds went over to the revolver. So now we have $4.1 billion of bonds at a weighted rate of about 3.5%. So, really well positioned from an interest rate cost of capital perspective moving forward. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA is now down to 2.8 times, and notably, as before we received the Gatan proceeds so with that transaction does close, it should bring us to another $700 million or so of after-tax proceeds that would further reduce leverage. So we had a very strategically positioned on the balance sheet and I think very, very well positioned to fund capital deployment moving forward. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil.
Neil Hunn: Thanks Rob. Now let's turn to our segment detail outlook. We can turn to our RF & Software segment. In the quarter, we saw revenue of $563 million, an increase of 14% for the quarter. Organically, revenue grew 4%. Importantly, the Software business wherein the segment grew organically 6% and toll and traffic this was in line with our expectations. Operating profit grew 16% to $168 million. Operating margin has expanded to 29.8. EBITDA grew 17% to $226 million, which represents a 40.1% EBITDA margin. In the quarter, we saw continued strong performance at Deltek across its government contracting and its professional services end market in terms of its software execution. It's nice to see that continued benefit of our relative market share advantage and our superior product offering in the government contracting space leading continued share gains. Also Deltek's professional services software offerings continued with its positive momentum with our new product Vantage Point. Finally, with Deltek they continue to see strength with the SaaS migration strategy driving increases in its recurring revenue. We also saw in the quarter outstanding growth at our Freight Matching business due to network expansions with increase in net subscriber adds and favorable end market conditions. With our Freight Match business both sides of the network scaled quite nicely in the quarter and this is a business where the size of the network and the scale of the network matters quite a bit, so we're seeing increasing returns of scale in this business. We saw double digit add rate growth aided by share gains. We talked in the past about the share gains in the large loss space and we continue to see those in the quarter. Also we saw good traction with our new SaaS offering targeted at the mid-law space. PowerPlan our acquisition we announced last quarter also performed well in the quarter and it was great to see SaaS wins in the adjacent end markets of manufacture and retail. PowerPlan has onboarded quite nicely. We talked about the last quarter. They've done a great job becoming acclimated to our culture and to our strategy tools. We're looking forward to having our planning session with them next month and we're certainly encouraged by their SaaS migration gaining traction as they talked about in our sale process. Also it's important to note, really all our software businesses did well in the quarter. We just sort of ran out of space on the slide here to talk about iTrade, talk about ConstructConnect, talk about CBORD really the entire software franchise here did quite well. Relative to our toll and traffic business, the pipeline of opportunities is favorable as we head into 2019. And with that as we look to Q4 we see 6% to 8% organic growth in the segment. We see the software businesses continuing with their consistent strong growth and cash performance and see this carrying into next year. Toll and traffic improves as we mentioned last quarter based on the timing of tax shipments and easier project comps. Turning to the next page, our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment. In this segment which represents 29% of Roper's revenue, revenue grew 11% to $380 million. This is all organic growth. It's really fantastic performance in this segment. The Medical businesses grew 7% organically and our Scientific Imaging businesses grew as expected based on delivering on the backlog. Operating profit grew 15% to $133 million, operating margin expanded 140 basis points to 35%, EBITDA grew 11% to $161 million and that represents an EBITDA margin of 42.4%. We saw very solid growth across the majority of our niche application software businesses serving health care markets. For instance, Strata continued to gain share in its SaaS-based cost accounting and decision support applications. SoftWriters continue to gain market share and its pharmacy operations software targeted towards institutional pharmacist also did a nice job coupling it's bolt-on products to its new customers. SHP continued core growth in its home health business and is also launching a new product targeted towards hospitals and Data Innovations continued its global market share gains serving the middleware market. Verathon had a tremendous quarter growing double digits. The demand for our new BladderScan technology was robust. We believe this is because the core technology embedded in the product, leads it to be the best market product in the market. Also, North American sales execution was terrific. The funnel management, their closer rates, being fully staffed, all led when combined with the product superiority to market share gains in the quarter. And finally as it relates to Verathon and the GlideScope business, recurring revenue was quite strong. This is a result of a very large global installed base of our Video Laryngoscope System and the recurring consumables being pulled to the installed base. For Verathon, this is one of many examples of Roper where the management team there is building this business for the long term and we expect to see this momentum carry into 2019, so really a great job by Earl and the team in Seattle. Northern Digital grew on the continued adoption of its proprietary electromagnetic measurement technology. We often have highlight many of our specific medical technologies, but MBI and their EM technology is really a great example of our innovation. As we look to Q4, we see 5% to 6% organic growth for this segment. We see mid-single-digit growth for the medical businesses and the Gatan Divestiture expected to close by the end of 2018 and is on track. Next page. Our industrial segment which is 17% of Roper's technology grew 15% to $230 million. Obviously this is all organic growth. Operating profit grew 19% to $74 million; operating profit margin grew 120 basis points to 32.3%; EBITDA grew 18% to $78 million which represents a 34.2% EBITDA margin. In the segment we saw double-digit growth again at Neptune which is driven by continued share gains. Really what's happening in Neptune is we see many customer networks form and when you combine that dynamic with our strong channel management; it's really those two things that are yielding our continual share increases. In the quarter, we also saw strong fluid handling growth across multiple end markets and applications. Roper Pump and Cornell Pump continued their share gains and we're also aided by favorable end market conditions. For the outlook for Q4, we see mid single organic growth with strong leverage as we saw this quarter and the end markets continue to remain favorable. The teams and the reviews for the quarter were quite optimistic heading into Q4 and heading into 2019. Turning to our energy segment. This segment which represents 11% of our revenue we saw revenue grow to $149 million plus 10%, 11% organically with the point of FX headwinds. Operating profit grew 27% to $46 million. Operating profit margin grew 420 basis points to 31.1% and EBITDA grew 23% to $50 million. This represents an EBITDA margin of 33.6% and the OP leverage was 73% just stunning in the quarter. We saw double digit CCC growth from a rebound of new construction projects. The team at CCC over the course of the past couple of years really worked hard to position the business and its products to capture the opportunities when the rebound occurred and we're seeing exactly that happen. As we see many new LNG facilities and projects come online next year, CCC is specified and the vast majority if not all of those projects. So it's a very good job by our team there. We also saw strong growth in our upstream applications and broad-based growth across our industrial end markets. I'll remind you the industrial business that we have here did really well, really all of them did and it's really a collection of niche leading test and measurement businesses that look at rubber testing, polymer testing, vibration monitoring, et cetera. The teams across the board here did very nice. As we turn into look to Q4 2018, we also see mid single-digit organic growth with strong leverage and the markets remain favorable and the teams also are optimistic for the quarter heading into next year. Now let's turn to our guidance update. We are raising our full year 2018 guidance. Our adjusted DEPS is now going to look in the range of 11.69 to 11.73, where we're previously 11.40 to 11.56. This represents organic revenue growth of at least 7% for the full year basis. We also established in our Q4 2018 guidance with adjusted DEPS of 3.10 to 3.14, and as Rob noted earlier, a tax rate of 23%, which is slightly higher than the rate we saw in the current quarter. Now let's turn to the Q3 summary. Our asset-light diversified niche market strategy continues to produce outstanding results. We saw 9% organic revenue growth and was broad-based across all four of our segments. We had record gross margin expansion of 80 basis points to 63.8%, and all of that got plus some carry down to EBITDA margins growing 100 basis points to 35.8%. It's really a testament to our niche strategy, the intimacy our businesses have with our customers, and our ability to nimbly execute through various market conditions and deliver fantastic financial results. Our operating EBITDA margins expanded in all four segments and free cash flow increased 34%, which is 31% of revenue. Also and importantly, we are strategically well positioned for continued capital deployment. First, we have a very strong balance sheet and our bond offering captured favorable fixed rates. Next, our pending and unscheduled Gatan divestiture will further enhance our acquisition powder. And to that end, our acquisition pipeline is quite robust, as we finished the year and head into 2019. Finally, our proven business model and our CRI discipline drives the ability to compound cash flow, and there's no better example of that done this quarter. As we look to Q4, we have a positive outlook and we see that carrying in the 2019. Next page. And just before turning to your questions, we wanted to briefly highlight the key tenets of our strategy. This strategy has proven successful for 15 years and this is thus strategy fully embracing our entire team by our board and by myself. I want to highlight three things about our strategy. First is the business type that comprises our portfolio. Our businesses are in niches. They are clear leaders in their niches. We often have a high percentage of the revenue recurring, which provides stability. We also have the ability to compete on customer intimacy not on scale. This is a very important point, which I'll come to in a moment. We always have new that higher gross margins are indicative of the value that our company deliver to our customers and all of our companies have the ability to grow without consuming capital. The second part of our strategy I want to highlight is the operating structure which we deploy, which many of you know is a decentralized structure. This structure works based on the profile of the businesses that we have. When you enter niche, you need to nimbly execute and this structure allows us to do so. Local decisions are made about resource allocation at our business units. But importantly, just because we're decentralized, does not mean that we are passive owners. We care deeply about strategic development and strategic execution and the teams building talent throughout their organizations. And we do that by deploying a set of group executives to use Socratic method to teach what it looks like across the businesses. And finally, relevant to our structure is our incentive system. The core to our incentive system is that we reward based on growth. Simply stated this allows there to be complete alignment throughout organization about what's important here and also for trust to be pervasive through the organization. And finally, the third thing I would like to highlight is our centralized capital deployment strategy. As decentralized as we are from an operating structure perspective, we are equal but oppositely centralized in the way we deploy capital. This allows us to take the excess free cash flow from all the businesses and deployed them in a way that is optimal for our shareholders. We do this by deploying our cash return methodology, which allows us to select the best businesses to add to the portfolio and this allows our strategy be centered on finding amazing business models versus having an end market-oriented strategy. The way we deploy capital was highly processed-driven using the CRI approach, using approach to evaluate management teams and using an approach to make sure that the businesses that we select to join the portfolio match all the ones we talked about before. And finally, what sits underneath all three of these tenets are three core values. One is throughout the organization is trust and mutual respect. I fully believe this is an organization where bad news travels faster than good and I view that as a core value that makes us a wonderful place. Second, our cash return on investment methodology. This is not just used to deploy capital, but it's used in all of our business about how to optimally grow. And finally, we work very hard to keep things very simple. As we grow the risk gets the complexity creeps and we viewed it as our core job to make sure that we keep things very simple. So in conclusion, this strategy is everything we're doing for the last 15 years and it will be consistent for the next 15 years. And with that, we'll open up for questions.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
Neil Hunn: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Hey. This is our first opportunity Neil to congratulate you on taking the helm and also congrats to Rob on his promotion. And I like that closing comments reaffirming what's unique about the Roper business model, so that was all good to hear. So my first question is since it's such a big focus area across the industrials and you kind of downplayed the issue in your opening comments, but can you talk about any areas of input cost challenges that are unique to Roper? And we heard the tariffs are non-factor, but there have to be some input cost pressures and maybe some indirect tariff pressures as well. But how would you describe that?
Neil Hunn: Yes. So it's Neil. I'll take a shot at this and then Rob can add any color. Let's talk about tariffs first and we can really talk about tariffs and the inflation together. So it's important to note that none of our businesses compete on scale, right? We have these. These are very small nimbly-oriented businesses that compete based on how quickly they can answer customers' needs. As you know our businesses are not gigantic, so as a result the supply chains are very nimble. And the management teams ability to execute through a tariff issue with either slightly rebalancing the supply chain or working through our pricing increase or pricing policy offset that we saw it the quarter. We saw that carrying into Q4 and into the next year. It's really a very, very small impact in Q3 and Q4. And the same can be said for input cost. If you look at our gross margins, there's just very little material that goes into what we do. And so what is there it's very minimal and that's our view. There's not much of an impact.
Deane Dray: Great. And then if we - could you comment more on the funnel as it stands today potential size and timing? And in your response, you talked about what those market volatility at downdraft typically due to bid-ask spreads. My experience has been sellers get awfully sticky with their memories of where there are multiple straight at higher, but what's your expectations here?
Neil Hunn: Yes so the funnel as we talked about is quite robust, but candidly is always robust. We just see a tremendous number of opportunities and we are oftentimes just betting through the opportunities and there might be an attractive opportunity we pass on because we think there's something that's more attractive that's going to come into future. So we continue to be very disciplined, but then that discipline is only outmatched by our patience to do what's right for the long term relative to the M&A funnel. But as it sits right now, it's quite robust and the teams are working hard to mature that. So it's always difficult to time or predict the timing of deals because we're just going to do what's right in the long term for shareholders. Relative to sizing, Rob talked about the strength of our balance sheet. We've talked in the past about $7 billion over a four-year period. That's just the way the math works out, but we've never - we don't feel or never have felt pressure or budget to try allocate capital or deploy capital in any specific small window of time and that remains consistent. Relative to the - if you will the valuations between private and public companies, it's something that we'll watch carefully. I do think its public companies get mark-to-market every day private companies don't. There typically is a little bit of a lag to the extent there is a long term de-rating of public companies that does take a quarter or two, perhaps a little bit longer for private companies to sort of realize that's where the market is. But at the same time these funds are always raising money and they have to return money to capital and so that oftentimes offsets that stickiness if you will. So it's not something that we view as any sort of material challenge to us to deploy capital going forward.
Robert Crisci: Yes I would just add to that Deane. From a target side perspective as we've said in the past, most of the targets that we're going after - kind of north of call it $400 million if value up well over $1 billion. I mean that tends to be kind of the sweet spot for the sort of things that we acquire, given our size and given sort of type of businesses that we're targeting. And I think most of the things in the pipeline are going to be in that general range.
Deane Dray: Thank you and congrats again.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Steve Tusa: Hi, guys. Good morning.
Brian Jellison: Good morning.
Steve Tusa: And I just wanted to publicly say, obviously, we all appreciate Brian and how unbelievable of a run that he had with this company and that wishing you Neil the best of luck in your new role, congratulations.
Neil Hunn: Well, thank you. And I'll remind you and everybody Brian is the Executive Chairman and still involved in the business in that capacity.
Steve Tusa: Yep. So just on this deferred revenue point, I mean, how fast kind of organically does that tend to kind of grow? And could you just, I'm not clearly a software analyst. Just wanted to kind of better understand how that works and kind of the dynamics into the kind of intermediate term. What is driving that and how fast do you expect that to grow as may be kind of as a percentage of revenues or something like that?
Neil Hunn: So it would generally grow in line with the organic growth of the software company. Sometimes if you're moving through sort of a change more towards fast some of our business are, they could go up a little bit faster. There's a little bit of seasonality with that as well so a lot of the renewals you have in the fourth quarter. So probably generally assume that deferred revenue gets better in the fourth quarter and then after that going into the next year will depend in the quarter sort of when the renewal happen. Many of these businesses they're getting a full year's worth of revenue in advance and that's really what's driving deferred revenue number.
Steve Tusa: And when you acquire a company, does that - that's obviously reflected in that number? Or is there some acquisition kind of mechanics where that is I don't know defined differently or there was like a step-up or something like that. Does that number just go whatever deferred revenue they had on the balance sheet that kind of goes into your deferred revenue number? How does that work?
Neil Hunn: Yeah, so purchase accounting requires you to take a haircut on deferred revenue of what's acquired. So you'll generally have less than a sort of a normal deferred revenue on day one and then that builds up over the next year. If you've noticed that one adjustment that we make that hit the revenue line adjusted revenue not just adding that accounting-based movement on the revenue where you're actually getting all the cost from a business, but you can't recognize some of the revenue from a GAAP standpoint. So that's where you sit the haircut. You will generally see more deferred revenue growth sort of the first year of ownership than other years.
Steve Tusa: Okay. That's a great reminder. Just one last quick one. How fast did Sunquest grow in the quarter?
Neil Hunn: So Sunquest, the quarter in the Americas business continued its mid single-digits decline for the reason we talked about in the past. The global part of the business and the CliniSys piece of the IPs and the global part of Sunquest grew as we also indicated in the past couple of quarters. So the story relative to Sunquest is the same in terms of sort of rebasing the North American business and looking forward to getting with the team in the next actually - Monday, Tuesday next week in Tucson to go through their three-year strategic road map.
Steve Tusa: And will that grow in 2019 U.S. course?
Neil Hunn: I think it will continue to be down. The U.S. will continue to be down in 2019.
Steve Tusa: Okay.
Neil Hunn: But today some of our businesses - yes. Steve healthcare software group we talked about that grew low single-digit organically inclusive of both the decline.
Steve Tusa: Okay. Great. Thanks for all the color and for the accounting tutorial appreciate it.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Davis: Hi. Good morning guys.
Neil Hunn: Hi, good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis: A couple of questions for you. But one just to start with Neptune. I don't remember a time period where Neptune was strong. I know it's lumpy, but seems like you've got some confidence going forward. I mean, you said, you made a comment about customer networks being formed. I'd love to get a little more color on that, just not an area we spend a lot of time on. But more explicitly, why our customers picking Neptune? I mean, I understandingly the technology is offered amongst the major three players are pretty similar. So why are you guys winning in this market?
Neil Hunn: Well we would beg to differ that products are similar. And I think the market share gains would demonstrate the customers are voting that way. We talked in the past. It's principally or one of the principal elements is that is the customers have been the journey of migrating from non-networks to network meters and on the network journey from mobile to fixed networks. Many, many years ago the Neptune product strategy was to allow all that to be backwards compatible. And so as the customers - and customer any region with network of meters, they sort of plan that migration over a series of years, not in big burst events and the backward compatibility has enabled this market share shift to happen because that we - the customers don't have to abandon their historical investment. So that's been a key tenet to the market share shift. And when we talked about - I talked about the mini network effect that's happening at the local customer level.
Scott Davis: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I'll follow on a little bit on Steve's question. I mean, Sunquest, the beauty of Sunquest is you didn't pay much for it. The downside is the outlook I think when you bought it you knew it wasn't going to grow much. But in your deal model, did you have it at some point hitting a decline in growth profile? I mean, I think you pay like 12 times EBITDA which is pretty low for this type of business?
Neil Hunn: I think it was more like 10 times is what we paid for. So we as a group it's worth just reemphasizing as a group of Acute Care Software assets they are growing and we see that continuing. If you peel off what we're talking about a part of the group and a part of a business that we're talking about which is the North American Sunquest business. And so certainly in our deal model, we didn't model that it was going to go back mid-single digits. We had it flat to up lows and going back over history right we bought it there was a meaningful use, tailwind that drove sort of outsized onetime growth over the course of 12 months to 18 months then we had to lap over that. And then we're here with this pressure - competitive pressure in the North American market that we've been experiencing this year a little bit last year and we'll continue to experience in the next year.
Scott Davis: I guess a different way to ask the question is are you on the deal model then? Do you look at it that way, even though it's been a while?
Neil Hunn: This was - there's been so many years.
Robert Crisci: Yes, we added a number of acquisitions to it which we wouldn't have added in the initial model and those all out. So, overall very good platform growth.
Neil Hunn: I think we acquired in 2000…six years.
Scott Davis: Yes I know I know but there's a lot of noise around it obviously and a lot of skeptics and I suspected the time that was in the purchase price. But just kind of point out I was trying to get to. But anyways, I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning and congratulations to Neil and his role. In terms of my first question, just wanted to circle back to the industrial revenue growth outlook, wonder if it was just conservatism whereby you do have that steep slowdown in the core growth dialed in and may be allied to that if you can give any color on the order trends or book-to-bill rates in recent weeks?
Robert Crisci: Yes. So for the industrial segment, the mid-single-digit organic guidance for Q4 is exactly consistent with what we said three months ago when we saw how the year would play out. Neptune as we've spoken about on the call is by far the largest business in the segment and they had sort of an unusually strong Q4 from a seasonality standpoint last year. They generally - in that business seasonality for Q4 is lighter than Q3 and last year for various factors, it wasn't - there is really wasn't any sort of a sequential to down Q3 and Q4, we see more normal seasonality this year. That's a big driver of it. I'd say that the order trends across the industrial and the energy businesses which is really the only place is really can give you an insights here, I mean at Roper or given some of the software, but these businesses we do of course look at the orders on individual basis and I would say they are very supportive of mid-single-digit organic and there's certainly optimism moving forward into next year. But we feel really good about the guide. I'd say on the energy businesses from a seasonality standpoint, we're probably assuming a little bit less than normal Q4 uptick in terms of seasonality and energy businesses. We just think that's prudent, some of that certainly will have great visibility in here and so we're not assuming a little bit less than what is normal, so could be there in that, but who knows.
Julian Mitchell: Makes sense. Thank you. And then just wanted to circle back to RF and PowerPlan, just remind us what kind of organic growth that business is delivering right now and whether that earnings accretion number for the second half, I think you talked about $0.12 or $0.13 last time, how you're tracking relative to that?
Robert Crisci: Yes we're on track. It's mid to high single-digit organic growth business, a little bit better coming in. It's certainly on track, so that is performing as we expected. I think the team has been a really nice job of quickly getting up to sort of the Roper processes. We had a great quarterly call with them last week and I think we feel really good about the trends of that business.
Julian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.
Robert Crisci: Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead,
Richard Eastman: Yes, good morning. Just very quickly just to stand RF Tech. Just a couple of questions, I presume from kind of waiting out the patience here the tolling and traffic was flattish in the quarter. But you did mention a number of pipeline opportunities there. I'm curious are those opportunities are backlog? Does the backlog add to toll and traffic provide any kind of insight into possible low single-digit or mid-single-digit growth for 2019?
Brian Jellison: Yeah. So you're right in the quarter on the distinct flash and again it's in line with our expectations. And I think the pipeline as it sits today now, it's big, it's robust and we're not going to add 100% against that pipeline. But if it falls at this does historically then we would see certain low single-digit possibly a little bit better as we head into 2019 with that business.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then just the other piece of this application software where we kind of spoken to Deltek and Aderant some like really good growth rates. But when you look at the software businesses, the app software businesses combined and you see this kind of 6% growth rate combined, what's your feeling from that from a cyclical standpoint? I know this is - there's a lot of recurring revenue in there, but again, you're selling to legal firms and Deltek sales into the government market where there's some pacing of spend. Is the 6% number for that piece of the business running may be a couple points hot relative to a cyclical growth rate for your app software businesses?
Brian Jellison: Yeah, we view this business is to be very consistent growers just very little of any cyclicality associated with them. So double-click for instance with Deltek I can certainly understand that concept that as government spending goes so is spending on the systems. But over history that's not the case because what happens to government contractors flow to where the money is and there's always money being spent. And so that's rising need for them to have the software to drive the compliance and the operations for instance. So we view these as consistent and not like a cyclical business is going forward.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Joseph Giordano of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Joseph Giordano: Yeah. Good morning guys.
Brian Jellison: Good morning.
Joseph Giordano: So on RF Tech, if we just assume like for sake of argument that we stop doing M&A and the deal that you've done kind of start slowing will the normalize drop down of that segment be materially higher than what we're seeing now? I mean just feel like that subs we've added over the last couple of years the characteristics of those business are a lot different than what has been in there historically. So like how would you think about what that normalize drop down x the impact of like the upfront cost of acquisitions?
Brian Jellison: So are we talking from a leverage standpoint on the incremental go?
Joseph Giordano: Yeah.
Brian Jellison: Yeah. So the software businesses generally has EBITDA margins 40% plus and the toll and traffic as you know is lower than that. So right, as these businesses ago the earnings leverage 40% plus probably a little bit better than that.
Joseph Giordano: Okay. Is Neptune…
Brian Jellison: That leveraged all traffic business so better leverage as we move more towards software and less cyclicality of course and a lot more recurring revenues and better growth.
Joseph Giordano: Yeah. That's the point okay. Okay. Is Neptune facing any issues currently with like sourcing of electronics environment we've heard a little bit about that on the call side from some of that occurred in that space. I'm just curious if it's anything that you guys are seeing there?
Brian Jellison: There's pockets of that as we do in our reviews really over the course of the last several quarters not unique to this quarter. I think it goes again to the nimbleness of the supply chains of these businesses to the extent there is an issue. They're really sole-sourced supply because again we are not buying things in a massive scale so we can shift production are shift the supply chain where it's needed. But we have seen as I mentioned in some pocket some component shortages, electronic component shortages.
Joseph Giordano: Okay. And then just last for me kind of more of a conceptual one. Neil, how do you see just in terms of style, I know you have the core fundamental beliefs that Roper is going to remain the same and how did you go about your business, but stylistically anything that you're bringing differences to the environment there? Maybe, how you take input from people or you have a different amount of people around you. Just may be talk about, how you plan on running things versus how it's been?
Brian Jellison: Sure. I appreciate the question. I view it to be very - I mean, the strategy is the same, the structure is the same. The way we deploy capital and the process rigor around that is the same. Stylistically, Brian and I certainly are different people with modestly different styles. I think both are - have been accepted by the organization. I think me having grown up here as a group executive in the trenches across the medical businesses and the application software businesses, as I sort of look to the next several years it's trying to bring a little bit of process - a little bit more process rigor about how we - the companies in the field develop strategy, how we get very focused on how to deploy that strategy and then also how the teams build the talent and build the talent offense within their teams. So it's less stylistically, but more having just grown up in the trenches here where Brian's always been the CEO from the day he started is maybe a little bit different perspective remains which I'll look through for the next few years.
Joseph Giordano: Great color. Thanks guys.
Operator: That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to Zack Moxcey for closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you everyone for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q2  (2018-07-26 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Zack Moxcey - Roper Technologies, Inc. Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc. Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc. Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.
Analysts: Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Operator: The Roper Technologies Second Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Zack Moxcey, the Vice President of Investor Relations.
Zack Moxcey - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Britney, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the second quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Brian Jellison, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Chief Financial Officer; Neil Hunn, Chief Operating Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President-Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now, if you'll please turn to slide 2; we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, and in our press release, and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to slide 3; today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to acquire deferred revenue; a deferred tax expense resulting from the held for sale classification of Gatan; and lastly, a measurement period adjustment to 2017 provisional income tax amount resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And now if you'll please turn to slide 4, I'll hand the call over to Brian. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. So, slide 4 gives you the overview of what we'll go through today. The second quarter 2018 enterprise results; a detailed look at the segment and the outlook for each segment; the quarter three and full-year guidance; and then we'll open it up for questions. So next slide, slide 5, the Q2 enterprise highlights. We had, as you know by now, record second quarter results, all time for revenue, net earnings, EBITDA, cash flow, and a host of other things. Revenue was up 13% to $1.3 billion and organic revenue was up 9%. The additional good news it was very broad-based across all four segments, really. Gross margin was up 40 basis points to 63.1%, so that demonstrates again we're not seeing very much pressure on either price or cost issues that you're hearing about from many other multi-industry people. EBITDA is up 14% to $449 million and EBITDA margin is 34.6%. The DEPS numbers is up 29% to $2.89. Operating cash flow was up 55% in the quarter to $266 million. And importantly, we deployed $1.1 billion to acquire PowerPlan and entered into an agreement to divest Gatan for $925 million. The timing at Gatan we had hoped would sort of demonstrate it really is a trade out of PowerPlan for Gatan. But the Gatan timing, it's got regulatory things that happened. So, it may not really close until the end of the year. Really, an outstanding quarter, very strong growth, margin expansion pretty much across the board, and record cash flow. Next slide. We look at the income statement, you could see that revenue reached nearly $1.3 billion, gross profit was up by 40 basis points from 62.7% to 63.1%. EBITDA was up to 34.6%, so about 30 basis points of improvement there. Earnings before tax – which is a number we want to have in here because a lot of the earnings reports were really talking about this year versus last year without adjusting for the tax benefits – so earnings before tax is up 17% on a revenue improvement of 13%, and that excludes the benefit of the new tax treatment. If you get to the DEPS number, where you see the benefit of the tax treatment, then earnings are up 29%. Tax rate was 23.1% versus 31% the year before, so you can see that the Tax Act is certainly working for us. Next slide. On compounding cash flow, you could see on that we delivered $266 million in the quarter up from $172 million last year. Our operating cash flow almost all turns into free cash flow, because we have so little CapEx. So you could see free cash flow here of $0.25 billion and our trailing 12 months operating cash flow was $1.230 billion which represented 25% of revenue. So, we're still on track for a very solid record cash performance in 2018. Next slide. If you look at the asset-light business model that we put in place, you continue to see a really important facet which is that the negative net working capital number has now really become a sustainable thing. So that sustainability is quite substantial. If you look at the chart here, you'll see deferred revenue has grown in just two years from $281 million in 2016 to $627 million at the end of this quarter. So that's a $346 million increase in deferred revenue in two years. Inventory is down to 4.3% of sales, and I always like to look at it not only just over this last three-year period but what was it five years ago? Well, five years ago our inventory was 6.3% of revenue, and now it's 4.3%. Receivables were 19.7% of revenue and now they're 16.4% of revenue. Payables and accruals were 11.3% of revenue and now they're 10.9%. Deferred revenue was 6.7% of revenue at the end of the second quarter in 2013, now it's 11.7% of revenue. So when you add inventory and receivables, subtract payables and accruals and deferred revenue, we're negative at 1.9% of sales. Five years ago, it was 8%. So we've had a shift of 10 percentage points of total revenue in net working capital, which is why we were so committed to continuing the transformation of the company. And it's going to improve further actually when we get – complete the trade out of Gatan for PowerPlan. So next slide. Here you've got the segment detail and outlook. Next slide. If we look at here the four segments, you could see the gross segment and EBITDA margin of each of the four segments, which all of them are really best-in-class numbers. So I know people – there's a lot been said about price, cost, tariffs; none of those are going to have any effect on us. We've got very nimble execution in the field. We went through our quarterly report process with everybody, and the nimbleness of the execution they demonstrated in there around any supply chain issues was really spectacular. We have such an incredible benefit because our cost of goods are so low compared to the typical multi-industry company. I mean, you see all these gross margins, but when you add it all up, our cost of goods sold represents about 36.9% of revenue. So you just don't have the same pressure that somebody who's got gross margins of 38% and cost of goods sold at 62% has. Our Energy business is down to 13% of total revenue. Industrial Tech – which a lot of that is Neptune – is 18% of revenue. So the more cyclical items in here certainly have performed phenomenally in the second quarter, but we don't see a lot of risk around that turning around over the course of the year. And RF & Software is running 42% of revenue, with Medical at 29%, so it's still well over two-thirds of the company's businesses. Next slide, slide 11. So this is the first segment slide, starting with the largest at RF Technology in the quarter. They did $539 million in revenue, which was up 13% from the prior year. Operating profit was up 19% from the prior year. Operating margin was 29.6%, but in here you got a lot of noncash amortization that goes into the operating profit margin. So looking at the EBITDA margin you could see how fantastic the RF segment is. It's at 39.3% EBITDA margin. If you look at the Q2 highlights for the businesses, organically we're up about 7%. Deltek had really a very, very good quarter, solid growth, very good execution in both their enterprise and small business platforms across both key areas of GovCon and Professional Services. And you want to remember that the Professional Services market we talk about isn't us doing services, it's Professional Services software for other people who are doing professional services. We had large wins in the quarter, some of which we're not allowed to talk about, but eventually they'll be known. That we really had both an increase in the number of seats for the software and net new customers. So a very strong quarter for Deltek. Our freight matching business also had phenomenal results. We had significant adds in net subscribers. And the market, the spot market is exceptional right now and we're certainly benefiting from that and expecting to have that trend continue. CBORD actually grew in its food and nutrition management software business on these healthcare campus-type environments where they get multiple facilities. And that was a nice turnaround for us. Toll and traffic grew low single digits, but did a very good job in terms of project execution, so they didn't – they had favorable variances. And then we had double-digit growth from the customer service centers that we have and we're winning more and more business in that area. There's a lot more visibility today on the part of these people that are going out and soliciting work on customer service centers because some of the competitors have had significant challenges recently, and the competitive advantage of using TransCore has never been more apparent. Just recently, the Governor of New York was talking about the incredible success of the cashless tolling project that we managed last year and into this year, which came in both below budget and on time. And if you look at a lot of the other projects people talk about in the transportation arena, you can never find those words, below budget, on time inside anybody's messaging. We completed an acquisition and on boarded PowerPlan. Probably the easiest onboarding process we've ever had because of the nature of the work that PowerPlan does. They're very much on top of all the data, and it just made their conformance to our modeling very easy. It's certainly a industry-leading niche application software business that we'll talk about a little bit more about here on the next slide. ConstructConnect continued to build muscle and expand into what we want to do with it. It's a great network business. We want to have it broaden out to more software, so it can serve larger clients with larger projects, and that's on track for where we expect it to be. In the second half of the year, you can see we're saying sort of 4% to 6% organic growth for this segment. About 25% of the segment remains in the tolling and back-office administration activity, but the other 75% are RF businesses and Software. We'll get strong growth and cash performance out of the Software businesses in the second half. Toll and traffic will be low single-digits in the third quarter, only because it's got a tough comp with Saudi and the New York projects in Q3 that give us about a $9 million headwind, but we expect it to improve organically in the fourth quarter with the timing of the technology piece of the business, the tags and collection technology shipping. All right, next slide. Here in this slide 12 is the PowerPlan acquisition. PowerPlan's a leading provider of software and solutions for asset-centric businesses. We'd like to talk about the business and the diligence process, but you got to – what somebody thinks as a telephone pole, but there's all kinds of things hanging on it. And from a tax and asset reporting requirement you got to know how much of that pole belongs to whom and as you might imagine it's a tedious, tedious process, and our software and solutions make that become much more operationally efficient. It's required to meet tax strategies that people have that mitigates the compliant risk they would otherwise have and it improves their cash flow. So, it's an easy sale. It has strong competitive advantages with very high barriers to entry. I mean, the knowledge that you need to have to be able to help a client is quite substantial. They've got a great, diverse customer base with a 98% retention rate on customers. The financial model is good and, as I indicated, it's going to be quite valuable for us because we're going to get a large deferred revenue balance once this thing is up and running inside our system. If you look at our acquisition criteria, which we occasionally publish, we said we want it to have strong cash flow characteristics; this business certainly does. We want it to be asset-light, meaning the net working capital would be modest, if any at all. We want it to have an excellent management team, which this does. We want it to be in a niche that's highly defensible, and we want to have deep domain experience, which this business requires and fortunately has. We want to have a lot of recurring revenue, and we certainly have that with this business with the subscriptions and continuing long-term contracts. And then, we like it to have multiple growth opportunities, which this business has, both in the asset-heavy industries as well as some of the other opportunities. Interestingly, if you sort of compare that to Gatan, which is a great business and you go through the same criteria: so strong cash flow, Gatan checked the box; asset-light, not so much, quite a few assets there for a Roper-type company; excellent management team, probably best-in-class really; niche market leader, absolutely, it couldn't get more nichey than Gatan; deep domain experience, many of the world's experts really are PhDs that are inside our Gatan business; high recurring revenue, no, almost no recurring revenue; multiple growth opportunities, well they're all focused around this emerging cryo-EM technology which is wonderful but it doesn't have multiple platforms, and it's certainly more cyclical. So, the trading out of PowerPlan and Gatan is very strategic for us. Next slide. On Medical & Scientific Imaging here you can see revenue was up 7%, EBITDA margins came in at 41.5%, very strong growth and execution in the niche medical software businesses, the smaller ones which are Strata Decision Technology, Data Innovations, SHP, and SoftWriters. And all of those really performed very well and even Sunquest U.S. lab business was on target, (18:29) was down but it was where we expected it to be. So that was actually encouraging. We had good market adoption of Verathon's new BladderScan technology which is kind of a breakthrough technology. And then the GlideScope consumables we introduced a while back have been growing quite substantially. Double-digit growth for the automated surgical scrub and linen technology business we have which they would say was a scrub excellent quarter. So, these guys are – you probably couldn't find a more passionate leadership team than the people at IPA in Atlanta, and that business is doing exceptionally well. Very strong revenue contribution from the backlog in Scientific Imaging as it's starting to shift, so that certainly helped. Notwithstanding that, we're still going ahead with the sale of Gatan, which we expect to close before the end of the year. It's already cleared the U.S. requirements but it's still got things going on where people are looking at it in Europe. High single-digit organic growth in the third quarter and then probably tapers down to mid-single digit growth in the fourth. The Medical businesses will grow single-digit, but we'll get some additional spike out of the Gatan and cryo-EM growth here in the second half of the year. We expect a strong Q3 results in Imaging because of that backlog. Next slide, which will be slide 14. So Industrial Technology really is just spectacular. It's the only thing you could say. Revenue was up 20%. Operating profit was up 27%. Operating profit margins – these are manufacturing companies, folks – operating profit margins, 32%. EBITDA 33.8%, up 140 basis points. Organic growth, up 18%. Another revenue quarter for Neptune, which had double-digit growth again, really driven by customer-focused innovation. We're just winning an awful lot where people see, hey, if I continue with Neptune and move into more collective technology I can still keep my installed base; I don't have to rip everything out and replace it. So Neptune continues to perform exceptionally well. We've had meaningful share gains with our Cornell Pump business. It's had a great year, but it had certainly a very, very spectacular quarter. One of the things Cornell has benefited is dramatically increased market share with the rental companies, and that demand was really strong from an order perspective early in the year. We think that'll kind of taper out some in the fourth quarter in terms of shipments, but the orders we expect to be very strong as the rental fleets get replenished. Roper Pump had very nimble execution in the quarter, so they had outsized growth. But when the whole place grows by 20%, there's really nobody you'd sort of single out to say they disappointed anybody, because they certainly – nobody disappointed, as everybody did spectacularly well. We think we're continuing to have double-digit growth in the third quarter and then mid-single digit growth in the fourth quarter only because the comps get more challenging. Very strong leverage that we'd get out of these businesses, which you can see in the numbers. The Energy segment is a similar kind of story. Organic was up double-digit at 12%. The upstream application businesses – AMOT, Metrix, DES, (22:37) and Viatran – were very strong. And then importantly, our Compressor Controls business, after being down and then sort of getting to the point of being flat, actually returned to growth in the quarter, and that's a much more long cycle business. So that's encouraging that that'll be coming up while maybe some other businesses would moderate. The Industrial end markets are pretty strong in every category that we're in. So we still see Q3 with double-digit organic growth. And then Q4, similar to Industrial Technology, with kind of mid-single digit growth, strong leverage. Energy segment was up 16% on revenue and 28% on operating profit, so that's just a proof of the strong leverage. You can see EBITDA margins were 30.5% for the segment. So pretty spectacular. Next slide. As we look at updating the guidance and we go to slide 16, the guidance update. We're raising the full-year guidance from $11.40 to $11.56 as a range – or we're creating it there at $11.40 to $11.56, that's up from $11.08 to $11.32. So at the midpoint it's up $0.28. Organic revenue growth we're now raising to 7% for the second half of the year. Previously we'd said 4% to 6%. And third quarter guidance we established at $2.89 to $2.95. Next slide. If you look at the summary then of this very, very good quarter, you can see that the niche market strategy and our ability to execute in a nimble way continues to deliver outstanding results. We had record results as we've covered throughout the talk, 9% organic revenue, everybody grew, gross margins up at 63.1%, demonstrates that we really aren't seeing these price cost issues or supply chain things from foreign tariffs. Earnings before tax were up 17% and the diluted earnings per share – adjusted diluted earnings per share were up 29% to $2.89. Operating cash flow was up 55%. The asset-light diversified technology transformation that we've been doing for several years now continues. The PowerPlan acquisition sort of shows exactly the kind of assets that we'll be acquiring. The agreement to divest Gatan strengths our balance sheet and gives us several-hundred-million dollars of additional capital to deploy, along with the repatriated money that's coming in. So the balance sheet is still in great shape. We continue to see a lot of attractive acquisition opportunities, and the pipeline's pretty significant. So, we're looking at both large deals and some bolt-on things that we're fully – we've got our teams fully deployed on the acquisition side of opportunity. Our cash return on investment discipline continues to prove that that's the best way to create shareholder value over the long period of time and compounding cash is what people should be looking at. So, we had an outstanding quarter, we've got great momentum, and let's open it up for questions. Hello? We're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. Our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Everyone.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Hey, good morning.
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Good morning.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, I appreciate the fact you preempted all the price costs and tariff discussions because that's been tying up a lot of these conference calls. Maybe the first question would be some clarification on the 2018 guidance whether that includes PowerPlan accretion, and could you size that for us please?
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, sure. Good morning, Deane. It's Rob. So, PowerPlan probably adds $0.12 to $0.13 to the second half, so that's included in the guide. We also if you look at the second half have a little bit of additional FX headwinds. We've included in there, probably $0.05 or $0.06. And a little bit higher interest cost on the fact that our revolver costs have gone up as the short-term LIBOR rates have gone up. So, that's all included in that second-half guide.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And what about PowerPlan's accretion to free cash flow? Sometimes you give that data point as well.
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Sure. So I think when we made the announcement we said it was about a $60 million addition to cash flow on a first 12 month basis. So, that's without the financing costs. And so again here is where you – do you apply the cash from PowerPlan to that, do you apply interest rate, so we – as you know, sort of the corporate balance sheet is separate from the individual acquisition. So, the company will deliver $60 million, less the financing costs, however you want to apply that.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, some context on the Gatan divestiture. And, Brian, you and I have had discussions over the years about your willingness to part with this asset, and you're refrain always was, if someone wants to pay us the multiple that we need or would expect and looks like you got it at 18 times. And now I know Rob has insisted there's not a big portfolio review going on, I get that, and it doesn't look like there's any soft spots in the earnings today, but are there other cyclical businesses as you do this transformation that you might be able to exit similarly?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Well, I think what you have to do is when we went through that list of what to look for in an acquisition, that's the same list we would look at for anything we own, right? So, the Gatan, while it's certainly the best technology available in its area and has incredible great people in it, misses on a number of our things. Many of the other longer-term businesses don't miss on those. So, let's take a pump company, if this got substantial spare parts that sort of offsets some recurring revenue stuff. Gatan has zero spare parts. Gatan is a business that was acquired in the 1990s by Roper at a time it wanted to go into areas that were scientific, really. We're not pursuing scientific areas; we're pursuing areas we feel we really know how to manage exceptionally well, and if there's any cyclical content we're totally on top of it. But Gatan's cyclicity can come out of the National Institutes of Health or Japanese investment, you can't do anything about that. And it's going to an owner where they have incredible synergies that we just don't have. So, it's a very good acquisition for the people that are buying it, and it's an appropriate sale for us.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: But just to put you on the spot, Brian, are there other Gatans within the portfolio that you'd consider divesting?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: We really don't have anything that's as scientific as Gatan which has no recurring revenue. If there was some business we thought was going to require additional capital investment that was unattractive, we'd certainly look at it. But we don't really don't have anything immediately for sale. I will say this, because of the Gatan sale, there's been a whole lot of new inbound calls about various businesses because I don't think anybody believed we would ever sell anything.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Exactly. I appreciate all the color and congrats.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, guys. Good morning.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Hey, good morning.
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Good morning, Steve.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: The cash flow has been a little bit lumpy, maybe a touch light in first quarter but very strong here in the second quarter, a nice catch-up. What do you expect for the year, maybe for the second half, and some of the moving parts there? You talked about the deal that's adding $60 million before on an annualized basis, but what's just high level, what to expect for the year, anything unusual?
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, Steve. I think you're right. So, we did outline last quarter, right, the lumpiness in Q1 around some onetimers, when we got paid with some of the big TransCore projects and some cash onetimers. So, you're right, we made that up in the second quarter, really nice growth, and we'd expect strong growth in Q3 and Q4. So, when we get on the full year basis, we should be approaching double-digit growth for cash flow on a full-year basis. So, it should be pretty strong in the second half.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then just on kind of the Industrial trends and orders, anything to call out there? It looks all pretty solid. Anything out of the ordinary from a macro perspective on the Industrial side?
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Yes. So the book-to-bill and order performance in those segments where it matters Industrial we're actually 1.0 book-to-bill. So good orders in places like Neptune and Roper Pump, so that gives us more encouragement, as we mentioned, for continued another double-digit quarter in the third.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: I think no question that the comps in Q4 are more difficult than focus (33:23), we had quite substantial growth in the fourth quarter of last year. That's why we're talking about kind of mid-single digit growth. Also, there was an interesting facet we've had market share gains with rental fleets this year particularly at Cornell, and they ordered earlier than normally this year. So, we don't know if that will repeat itself in the fourth quarter. If it does, we might have some upside benefit there, but that's unusual. Usually they don't start placing significant orders 'til the year is underway and they have a firm view of what they think their demand will be. So, there's some variability there but it's only to the upside, I think.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Some good elaboration on PowerPlan, I wanted to go maybe a little bit further. Any specific levers with that name under Roper's ownership particularly that stands apart from how you view the majority of your acquisitions? And in particular you had the comment about multiple growth opportunities, maybe we could build on that and if there's any thought around opportunity for pricing for value.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Well, a couple of things. Let me just start by saying, one of the benefits that happens when we acquire any one of these companies that came out of private equity is this massive relief of their customer base saying, I've always wondered what was going to be the exit, who is it going to go to, is it somebody that's going to invest in the business for growth, is it going to pay attention to customer service and enhancements. So we know Roper's going to do all of those things. So that's a home run, and it creates a much easier end market sale discussion. That's proven out a lot in a place like Aderant with our legal software. It's proven out at ConstructConnect, and it's really going to prove at PowerPlan. Now, as far as the sort of specifics around the multiple growth vessel, I'll let Neil talk a little bit about that.
Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. And good morning, Chris. So, I'd first start by saying the core of what they do which is the asset and tax accounting for these very asset-intensive end markets around utilities, power generation, energy, that just by itself is still very robust and vibrant. There's a number of new products the company is developing to continue to sell and cross-sell into that end market. Over the course of the last couple of years, they've also gone into some very close adjacent markets with some success, think oil and gas, a little bit less asset-intensive but nonetheless have similar issues. Also, over the course of last couple of years they worked very hard at migrating their technology stack into the cloud which then enables them to do open an uplift opportunity where they migrate the existing on-premise customers to the cloud which is a net growth driver for PowerPlan like it is with Deltek. Part of that is because you're on boarding more responsibility for the tech stack but also, to your point, that gives you the opportunity to price a little bit more for value. And then finally with this lighter-weight implementation in the cloud, they're able to go into entirely new markets; think retail manufacturing that have similar type issues. And they're able to sell the SaaS solution to a business owner of a problem versus a technology owner inside the organization. So it's a multiple set of growth drivers, and it's been that way with this business for the last few quarters and certainly continued into the second quarter of this year.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: That sounds pretty good.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: (37:15) You've got an accounting change around operating leases. So it has a big effect on people's balance sheets. So you got a lot of people that have got new found interest in understanding every element of their operating lease programs, and PowerPlan's software helps them immeasurably there.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Sounds great. Thanks. Quick one on toll and traffic. How would you describe the opportunity relative to the more stark competitive differentiation you talked about for service orders? And you don't usually describe toll and traffic as just low single-digits growth as you did for the third quarter.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Well, it's a lumpy business. A lot of times it depends what the corresponding quarter a year ago was. And so it was outsized because of the start of the New York City transformation to cashless tolling. And then we had pretty big Q3 with Saudi last year. I mean, the contract stuff is, we're very selective on what we'll take in terms of a new customer. So we're interested in customers where we're going to really improve their ability to execute, but not every customer is driven by that. So we're going to be very selective on what we take. But we're getting double-digit growth, we think that's going to continue because all you got to do is pick up the newspaper or read about some of the horror stories of what our competitors have done to not be able to bring on anything new and wind up with millions of unpaid toll requests. So that kind of changes the competitive advantage we have because we deliver what we say we'll do; not everybody else does.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Hey, good morning.
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Hey, Joe.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, just maybe parsing our the guide one more time. It looks like the guidance raise was primarily to beat this quarter as well as putting in PowerPlan, offset by FX. So there really isn't much of a change to the second half. Brian, I thought your commentary around Industrial growth and where you could potentially outperform in the fourth quarter was interesting. I was wondering if you can maybe walk through the other segments and how you guys are thinking about growth in the second half of the year for each of the other segments.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Well, I think that we told you on balance it's about 7% organic growth. I think each one of those segments, I could go back and look at it.
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I think – right.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: It's single digits, high single-digits. So I don't know what more you want, Joe.
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, so a little bit more difficult comp in the third quarter of the RF on the tolling, as Brian mentioned. And then, a little bit more difficult comps in Q4 across some of the Industrial and Energy markets. And then we do have timing of those Imaging shipments are very heavy in Q3 so that drives that segment. So yeah. I think we did tweak up the organic in the second half, probably 1 point versus previous guide. So there's a lot of gives and takes there to get you to the midpoint of our range.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Yeah. No, I just noticed that you guys were forecasting growth that was slightly lower in the second half versus the first half. And obviously, know the tougher comps in Industrial but just wanted to see if there were other puts and takes. I guess my second question is, as you think about Gatan and the dilution from that business divesting into next year, can you just quantify that for us, so we have that number?
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Well, so let me just correct what you just said because actually the second half growth we have almost exactly the same as the first half growth, right around 7% organic, which was the same as the first half. So it is – now, one other point, we did have a very, very strong second quarter with Deltek, as we mentioned, some of the large shipments of new revenue or new recognition revenue on wins. And so some of that's probably a little bit bigger in Q2 than we originally would've had, expected that later in the year. But that would be the only other kind of one-timer. In terms of the dilution, so we'll touch on that certainly next year, but right – we would hope to deploy that capital in due course. And you got to always think about if we're going to get after-tax proceeds we're going to redeploy that. And so, that's the right time to measure the impact of a divestiture.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Gordon (sic) [Giordano] (42:08) with Cowen.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Good morning.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: So I wanted to ask, on Sunquest you say it came in line and that's good that you guys kind of – I think you've ring-fenced what that business is going to do near-term. So maybe, Neil, I was just curious as to the confidence in that – like in the future growth of that business, or how do you kind of weight that versus kind of this is the trend for the next couple of years?
Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Well, I would – when we first talked about the North American challenges Sunquest versus everything else, the rest of world of the diagnostic group, we introduced that a couple of quarters ago, we characterized this being a – it's got a couple of year issue, 2018 and 2019 issue. As we sit here today, a couple of quarters into it, I would say that continues to be the case and our belief. The international piece continues to do well. The interconnectivity or middleware piece that connects lab instrumentation to lab software continues to do well. And the team has done a good job of framing the North American strategy and starting to put hands on keyboards around some new software we're going to develop, but that going to take time to actually get done and released. And we'd expect the general trend line to continue here into next year.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, on CCC, was that growth coming from new projects or is that more from maintenance work? And then I just had one last question on DAT. And just curious if there's any like block chain implications for that business or anything that they're working on there?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Well, there's certainly some new construction orders that are coming online for first time in a long time. A lot of the work is upgrade work, where people have been postponing various thing until they see a better market. And so, we've got a huge installed base. So, we're getting both upgrades and just general improvements in plans, and then some new construction orders which we think will pick up more throughout the next two or three years.
Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.: And relative to your block chain question with DAT, it's just the nature of the DAT business, we're matching basically the supply and demand side of the spot trucking market in North America. It doesn't really connotate to a block chain orientation; that's more of a supply chain issue. So we do see more of block chain activity happening, for instance, in our iTrade business around the food supply chain, but not so applicable at DAT.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just my first question on Medical & Scientific Imaging, how are you thinking about margins in the second half? Were you sort of thinking they should be flattish? And then what kind of operating leverage, I guess, do you think we should see looking out beyond that? And then related to that, on Medical & Scientific Imaging, pro forma for the Gatan divestment, could you just remind us what the recurring sales mix will be in this segment?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Just so you understand something, Gatan doesn't certainly have any recurring sales, right? So, it's just pretty much all new business all the time. And we happen to be in an up cycle for Gatan because of new technology that we developed and took place (45:43) which the marketplace is accepting. Then if you look at the segment numbers, you've got to be careful here because we've got to have the declining situation in the U.S. lab business which is exceptionally high margin. So, actually if we pulled that out and segregated it, the margins would be going up not down, because the growth is in businesses with higher margins. It's just that when you got a business whether extraordinary margins, if it's down 2% or 5%, it's hard for the rest of it to make it up. So don't confuse yourself with the idea that there's any degradation in margin enhancement in Medical because that's wrong; it's just the fall off of the U.S. lab business at extraordinary margins.
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, that's right. So, the total of the segment – we have a better – I think still down in the second half but better than it was on the first half where it was down a little over 100 basis points.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I mean it's all the way down to 41.5% EBITDA margins here in the quarter, right?
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: So, it'll be better in the second half.
Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, instead of down only slightly, I understand. And then Gatan, yes, I mean, I understand it's not recurring as you'd explained 20 minutes ago. I guess the question was just pro forma for it therefore, how much is the recurring share of the segment going up?
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. So that segment's well over we call over 50% re-ocurring revenue and then it will go up from there, high-50s. That's the envelope, probably high-50s.
Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood. Thank you.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to Zack Moxcey for closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-04-20 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Zack Moxcey - VP, IR Brian Jellison - CEO & President Laurence Hunn - COO & EVP  Robert Crisci - VP & CFO
Analysts: Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Jeffrey Reive - RBC Capital Markets Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the Roper Technologies First Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. Today's conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, Abby, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the first quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Neil Hunn, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.  Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.  Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and is further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release and also included as a part of this presentation on our website.  For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items on a pretax basis, a $74 million adjustment for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and a $2 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue relating to software acquisition. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized if not for our acquisition.  And now if you'll please turn to Slide 4, I'll hand the call over to Brian. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: Thanks, Zack. Good morning, everybody. We'll go through the first quarter, look at the segment detail, talk about the rest of the year and then take your questions. So next slide. We had a record quarter of virtually every kind of metric you can think about. Revenue was up 9% to $1.2 billion and organic growth was up 6%. It was broad-based across all the segments, they all grew mid-single digits or greater.  Gross margin was up, again, 30 basis points to 62.5%. We'll talk a little bit about that later because in an environment where people are starting to worry about cost push, inflation or price cost issues, it's sometimes forgotten that the 62.5% means something really important, that our cost of goods sold is only 37.5%.  And in an environment where people worry about material, if you only got a cost of goods sold ratio of 37%, it looks a lot better than those guys that have gross margins of 38%, meaning cost of goods sold of 62%.  Earnings before taxes were up 10% to $332 million. We put that in as a distinct reference so you can see what was unrelated to the Tax Act versus what's related to Tax Act. So the 10% up is earnings before tax. The DEPS earnings, which includes the sort of trifecta around the Tax Act for us, were up 24% to $2.61.  The operating cash flow was $282 million, which is 23% of revenue. We'll talk a little bit about that number. It's terrific at 23% of revenue, a little lower than last year for a specific reason. We reduced the debt by $535 million in the quarter, and since the end of 2016, we've taken $1.6 billion off of our gross debt number. So it was really a great quarter and really throughout the enterprise, we had very good execution.  Next slide. If you look at the income statement, you'll see revenue went up from $1.1 billion to $1.205 billion. Gross margins from 62.2% to 62.5%. The tax rate down at the bottom, you can see was 28.2% last year, this year, it was 18.1%. I think we guided people sort of high teens. The rest of the year, we think, it'll be about 23%. Q1 is a little lower because of some unique benefits that happened in the first quarter on a tax perspective. And there, you can see that the adjusted DEPS number was up $0.50 from $2.11 to $2.61.  Next slide. We look, again, at the progress we continue to make on deferred revenue on our asset-light business model. If we just look at the last two years, two years ago at the end of the first quarter, we had 4.8% net working capital to revenue. This quarter, we closed out at a negative number of 2.7%. You can start to see a trend now because on this slide, if you look at the column 3/31/17, that was a negative 2.9%. And that was the first time that we had gone to negative working capital. And now this time at 2.7% is the fifth consecutive quarter where we've been at negative working capital. And that's run from a negative 2.9% to 2.4% to negative 2.5% and negative 3.3% and now, negative 2.7%. So starting to get a real-world, new normal for Roper.  Five years ago, when you look at the same data, inventory this quarter was at 4.5% of revenue and five years ago, it was 6.8%. Receivables, we're at 16.4%. five years ago, they were 19.3%. Payables and accruals were exactly the same, 11.5% this year and 11.5%, five years ago. But deferred revenue, close to doubled from five years ago, it was 6.5%, five years ago of revenue, now, it's 12.1%.  When you total it up five years ago, we were 8.2%, net working capital to revenue, and now, we're negative 2.7%. So when you basically make an 11% swathe on sales of approaching $5 billion, it's a big, big, big change.  Deferred revenue, you can see totaled $585 million at the end of the first quarter, which is more than double what it was just two years ago. So as we continue to grow, we find that the working capital becomes a source of funds for us.  Next slide. We continue to compound cash flow and are in a particularly good place to achieve another all-time record in 2018 for cash flow performance.  In the first quarter, we had two things that were unusual. There was timing of a tax payment in 2018 that totaled about $43 million, and then we had, in the first quarter of last year, a big MTA payment for that project. It was around $34 million and another one in the Middle East for about $16 million. So there was $93 million of an unusual variance between the first quarter of this year and last year, and that will smooth out as the year goes on, and we'll still deliver a very high operating cash flow to revenue and free cash flow as well. You can see the conversion number here with the GAAP to net earnings conversion at 141%.  Next slide. The sort of strong financial position, you can see the debt structure here. Cash is at $366 million. We were able to repatriate about $300 million of non-U.S. cash in the first quarter, still a couple hundred million left that we think we'll be able to repatriate during the course of the year.  Our undrawn revolver, we have $2.5 billion revolver, and there's nearly $1.8 billion in that revolver that remains undrawn. So our capacity for investing in capital deployment is very high. Our gross debt has dropped down $1.2 billion just in the last year and the net debt number also down substantially. If you look at our trailing EBITDA for that period of time, we're up $261 million. So you're up on EBITDA, down on debt and that gives you the net debt-to-EBITDA number here of 2.6x versus 3.7x a year ago. And you're picking up more than sort of 20 basis points on that thing every time.  So the way we build cash here, it takes no time at all for us to be below 2x net debt-to-EBITDA. But we're likely to find ways to deploy capital here in 2018, could happen sooner than later. We're in a number of transactions now, all of which are attractive, but you never know if you're going to get any of them done.  Next slide. Here we look at the segment detail, and all of these things are really wonderful businesses. But if we turn this next slide, here to Slide 11, you'll see our trailing 12-month margins, the gross margins on the top and the EBITDA margins on the blue line at the bottom are really spectacular for all of our segments.  So you look at energy at 57%, gross margin and 31% EBITDA margin. Part of what I want to point out is that the enterprise in total is running about 62.5% gross margin, so it's very much like the RF & Software line. And if you've got 37% cost of goods sold, which would be the reciprocal of that gross margin, and half of your cost of goods sold is material, and it goes up by 10%, if you can raise your prices by 1.9%, you have no cost risk at all. And if the material is only 1/3, which is more like what it is with us, and prices go up on material by 10%, you wipe that out with a 1.5% price increase.  So we are not seeing, do not expect to ever see this cost push in price and pressure that other people are complaining about, talking about the material cost. And part of that is that our cost of goods sold, it's quite modest compared to the other multi-industry guys. Our businesses are really in outstanding niches. They're nimbly led. And I can assure you, we were on top of any of these kind of issues related to tariffs or material price or anything else.  Next slide. We carried our biggest segment here, the RF Technology & Software group. It did almost $0.5 billion in the quarter. Revenue was up 7%, operating profit was up 13% and the OP margin was up 130 basis points, which was particularly satisfying because of a lot of the amortization that gets into that OP margin. Organic for the segment was up 4% with FX having a favorable impact just 1% here.  We had low single-digit growth in toll and traffic, which we weren't necessarily expecting. Very good execution, so we're finding good margins and not having negative variances. A lot of stuff is out for quote, but it's feedback on timing is just very unclear. Deltek Software business continues to do really well, both the GovCon and the professional service markets are doing exceptionally well. The bolt-ons we did for them [indiscernible] are performing as we expected they would and we're getting the synergies that Deltek had expected to get.  On ConstructConnect, I'm going to ask Neil to tell you a little bit about these two small bolt-on acquisitions we did to expand our preconstruction takeoff and estimation software. These help us expand the size of our network, one is called QuoteSoft and the other is PlanSwift. In total, we invested about $39 million. So, Neil, you might just explain how those make ConstructConnect's network stronger.
Laurence Hunn: Right. Both QuoteSoft and PlanSwift are in the preconstruction planning space and focus on automating the takeoffs and estimation activities of contractors. Both enhance the ConstructConnect network and product platform, where it's more comprehensive in ConstructConnect's pursuit to be embedded in the daily workflows of contractors relative to their preconstruction activities. QuoteSoft focuses on the HVAC and plumbing trades. PlanSwift focuses on other trades such as flooring, drywall, windows, et cetera. Thank you, Brian.
Brian Jellison: Okay. Aderant also had spectacular quarter. They were up double digits with significant gains with large law firms. So we continue to feel good about Aderant, but they certainly are outperforming this year. On our Freight Matching business, that growth has really been driven by a combination of solid markets, but substantial improvement in retention and net subscriber adds here. We just launched another app on expanding the ability to track loads, which we think will drive additional growth in the second half of the year.  And then lastly, our RF IDeas unit in Chicago is doing exceptionally well with the privacy concerns. Their technology really allows identification of individual people in a wide variety of access areas, around access control and access to storerooms and supplies. So that business is really terrific. For the rest of the year in terms of Q2 to Q4, we think we'll have about mid-single-digit growth in the software businesses with their outsized margins and cash performance. The toll and traffic is harder to predict. We think we'll get modest growth there, but it actually could be outsized, but it's just, it's hard to predict. In total, we think the segment will grow around 4% to 5% and continue to have the terrific margins that we see here.  Next slide. If you look at Medical & Scientific Imaging, $366 million in revenue, it was up 5%. Did a little bit better on the revenue side than we expected, and we had some particularly good breakthrough situations. We've had an accelerating rate of adoption at Strata with the financial decision support cloud software we have.  And importantly, Kaiser, which is one of the largest entities in the country, Kaiser Permanente, adopted the national cost accounting program technology that's supported here by Strata. To get the idea of the size of that, Kaiser's got 12 million members. They have 22,000 doctors and 39 hospitals. So for Strata, this is the sort of perfect validation of how good our technology leadership is compared to everybody. And we expect both adoption to continue at an increasing rate, and we think we'll gain share from other people with older systems.  And the second area I want to highlight here is given the fact that we had 4% organic growth, we had a decline in revenue in the high margin U.S. lab business, but fortunately, it was really offset by growth in revenue in our data innovations diagnostic connectivity business and CliniSys, our international lab business.  So the good news around that is that it really thwarted the decline in revenue, but it can't make up for the operating margin. So where you see the 150 basis points deterioration of OP margins going to 32.9%, that's still that pressure we're going to have this year and next on the U.S. lab business.  We had high single-digit growth in the software solutions for both long term care and home health, with our software acquisitions that we made a couple years ago called SoftWriters and SHP. The medical product businesses in total came in at mid-single-digit growth, and we see that sort of continuing throughout the year. And then Gatan continues to build its backlog where some new products that were launched last year and will continue to have expanded growth over the next several years. So we actually commenced shipping the next generation of these cryo-EM projects right at the end of the quarter.  As we look for the balance of the year, in Q2 through Q4 for expectations, we think we'll have broad-based growth across the medical businesses as a group. Scientific imaging should continue to improve over the prior year, and we think we'll get mid-single-digit organic growth for the segment in total, but will still be down maybe about 100 basis points on margin due to the U.S. lab business with its higher margins declining as a part of the mix of the segment.  Next slide. On Industrial Technology and Energy were pretty spectacular. They had double-digit growth for both segments. You can see Industrial was up 18%, Energy was up 11%. On Industrial, the organic was up 15%. We had double-digit growth at Neptune, and we had all-time record orders for Neptune as they continue to benefit from real customer-focused innovation. I think one of the things that's really showing up in the last 1.5 years at Neptune is the software experience we've had in our other businesses, we've been able to sort of virtually add to Neptune's capability in that arena and help guide them in terms of all the development things that they're doing, which are quite exciting as they build new technologies in Atlanta and have the plant focusing on what it does best, its boundary.  We're backward-compatible at Neptune in almost everything we do. And as a technology company, you find Neptune acting and behaving like an emerging technology company now as opposed to somebody that's making a lot of years, and that's very exciting for all of us.  The Cornell Pump had an all-time record. I mean, they're -- they have gained share at the expense of other pump companies at an extraordinary rate. They'll have a record year. The first quarter was just beyond spectacular and to Robert and all the team out there, we just thank you for your outstanding performance.  We had really good end markets in our Roper Pump business where their execution and our technology products are sort of taking off again with the DuraTorque technology. We've got better solutions with rubber and bearing wear and drilling faster and deeper than many other people do, and so they're back. They're not back to the all-time levels that they enjoyed a few years ago, but they're certainly up quite substantially.  And for the remainder of the year, we think we'll get sort of high single digit growth organically with great leverage. Leverage in these segments are pretty strong if you can see revenue up 18% and operating profit up 23%.  In the Energy segment, we had 5% organic growth. We had strength in upstream applications, which were sort of similar to Roper Pump. Our AMOT businesses were up very, very dramatically. Most importantly, our compressor control business did better than we expected, sort of flat to the prior year. We expected it would be down some, and we're starting to see green shoots for compressor controls for 2019 projects that we wouldn't have expected this early. And so that's encouraging for the longer term for that business.  The industrial businesses pretty much universally that are inside the Energy segment all performed reasonably well. For the rest of the year, we think we'll have sort of 5% to 7% organic growth with good leverage throughout. And with that, I think we can turn to our guidance update.  Next slide here, Slide 16, you can see that we're raising our full year guidance from $11.08 on the low end -- or I'm sorry, from $10.88 on the low end to $11.08. And on the high end, from $11.20 up to $11.32. Organic growth, we've raised by a point, 4% to 6%, up from 4% to 5%. All of the end market data we see supports that.  Our tax rate is going to be sort of 23% for the second quarter, the third and the fourth. We don't think there'll be much variation between those quarters, and it's up from the lowest quarter of 18% in the first quarter. Q2 guidance, we're laying in at $2.65 on the low end and $2.71 at the high end. All of these point to operating cash flow that should continue to be a record in 2018.  Next slide. If we look at Q1 on the summary, sort of two main themes that we take away from the quarter is that our asset-light, niche market strategy continues to deliver just spectacular results. And a lot of that comes from nimble execution from our business. We had broad-based revenue growth as we've said with organic at plus 6%. The end market data we see is encouraging. We probably haven't seen any more optimism as a group as we went through our Q1 reports and talked about forecasts for the balance of the year. I think there's a mature level of optimism as opposed to euphoria.  I think people feel really good about not being impacted by any of these geopolitical issues or tariff issues or cost push inflation on material because our cost of goods sold is so low in material and so much less a component of our cost structure.  Our gross margins were up, which sort of proves the point that we're staying ahead on that price cost challenge.  Earnings before taxes up 10% and with the trifecta of tax reform giving us a lower rate, allowing us to repatriate cash and then getting more value out of the cash that we were providing before because we get to keep more of it, we were up as you can see 24%.  And then on the other side is our capital deployment side, which the balance sheet really has put back into a great place for us. We reduced debt by $1.6 billion since the end of '16. The still pace would be about $7 billion of acquisitions over the next four years including this one. We're seeing a lot more attractive opportunities in the pipeline already, and we're engaged in several, all of which look attractive at this point.  So we had a great first quarter. We got a positive outlook for '18, and we've raised the guidance.  And with that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman: Just a couple things, Brian. The core growth outlook for '18 kind of bumped up by this -- by a point-or-so. And when I kind of sift through the commentary on the platforms, is it safe to assume that the industrial tech platform has a bit more momentum maybe than planned earlier in the year? Is that primarily where the core growth outlook has bumped up?
Brian Jellison: I wouldn't say that. It was a little stronger in the first quarter than we expected because some of the businesses are industrial. Certainly, Neptune was spectacular, belies to everything everybody else says about these spaces. Felt better about that. There isn't anything that's soft, so we're talking about the rest of the year at high single digits, not at 15%. But yes, I think that's good. Actually, maybe more encouraged by medical in some respects because two good things happened. You -- the level of reduction in the U.S. lab business was what we expected. It wasn't higher than we expected, It was manageable, and we offset it with growth in other portions of our overall lab business. So that was encouraging. It gives us a little better feeling for the year. And I think just the general attitude of everybody when you challenge them about their forecast, the way we run the company, we don't use budgets, but we don't tell people, we use finances. Drill down exactly in Q1 what you were this quarter versus one year ago and why that's going to sequentially change and what's going to happen. The answers to all those questions around where the orders are coming from, where the growth was coming from were all very mature and very well thought out reasons, hence, builds a little confidence for us and so we've raised the organic growth by one point.
Robert Crisci: Yes, it really was, Rick, broad-based. And the first quarter really look at each of the four segments, really outperformed our internal model, and that confidence then continues throughout the year as we go through our review process and talk to all the leaders.
Richard Eastman: Sure. Okay. And then just as a follow-up, when you look at the M&A pipeline, Brian, you referenced it's essentially full and there are some nice opportunities in there. Is it more target-rich in the application software area, which would fall into RF? Or is there some medical software in there? I presume it's software-dominated, but maybe you could just provide a little bit of color, maybe next layer down on what that pipeline looks like.
Brian Jellison: I think most of the things are application software network kind of things, so less likely to be medical. At the moment, the things that we're doing are not medical, but it doesn't mean there wouldn't be one. I mean, we're actually just starting to look at one, it's a smaller thing in medical. But there are a lot of application software things and there's some things that we've looked at in the past that we gave people advice about what they ought to do to make it a better company, and some of those people have taken that advice, and we're going to maybe look at them again to see how we feel about that.
Operator: We will take our next question from Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company.  Okay, we will go to our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Jeffrey Reive: This is Jeff on for Deane. My first question is just on your toll and traffic business. Can you maybe just talk about the bid pipeline that you're seeing and maybe more broadly the penetration of cashless tolls?
Brian Jellison: I think the bid pipeline is extremely full. I think there are some people waiting around to see if there's going to be any support from an infrastructure program that the government throws out that would pay for stuff that they otherwise have to pay for themselves. We really have always driven the cashless tolling because we have the supreme technology about the ability to read various things. So we have a family of multi-protocol readers that can read a wide variety of technology. So those things really facilitate people doing adoption. So you watch the people drive through at high rates of speed and then we really have great execution capability for remotely accessing those technologies and helping people manage it. All of that is good. And then lastly, in addition to the technology where we're really preeminent, there's also just the administrative back office activity and there's a lot of bidding around that as some of the very long in the tooth administrative people that have been around for a very long time and who've not improved very much. A lot of people are looking for new players. And so when they look out for somebody that has a proven track record and has expanded rather than not expanded the technology, we kind of get the first look. So we're involved in a lot of those things as well.
Jeffrey Reive: Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up, do you have an update on the timing of the resegmentation of your portfolio and the initiative to streamline the internal P&Ls?
Brian Jellison: The situation around that sort of it's, what are we acquiring this year? Are we going to divest anything? Is that going to have an effect on anything? Neil spent a good deal of time in the quarter beginning to look at that, and he's spending a great deal of time the second quarter traveling around and visiting with people. So I think that will continue to progress throughout the year.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Lee Sanquist [ph] on for Julian. In medical, you touched on the mixed headwinds from U.S. labs, but not the start up costs in Australia. Can you just update us on the cost to ramp up for the Queensland project?
Laurence Hunn: Yes, it's Neil. So the project has started. It started on track. It'll be one where the timing of revenue relative to the timing of the expenses will be a little imbalanced or out of balance this year and then it corrects itself for the remaining nine years of the contract. And so it's on plan in terms of our expectations and we would continue to expect the project to progress in that order.
Unidentified Analyst: Understood. On the balance sheet, the delevering effort has been very impressive. Can you just provide a perspective, updated perspective on the capital deployment priorities if, in the off chance, M&A does not materialize?
Brian Jellison: I don't think there's any chance that [indiscernible] M&A does not materialize. So that's the perspective. Believe me, in a slow year, we'd look at $10 billion of opportunity, make offers. There is no way that we're not going to be having the ability to do fantastic transactions in M&A.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company.
Joseph Giordano: Curious, like you mentioned the Aderant growth, and how early or late are you into that whole customer base being up for grabs and having to make decisions there?
Laurence Hunn: Yes. I think it calls for a mid, if you will. I mean, there's -- the competitor has a forced migration coming in 3.5 or 4 years, and so customers are in the process of getting ahead of that. And so we've got several years to go. I think it's worth also noting that Aderant is not sitting around waiting for that day to come. I mean, there's a number of new products we're launching and other initiatives we're doing to be able to offset that growth dynamic four years down the road. So in the short term and in the interim, I think we're in very good shape.
Joseph Giordano: Great. And then, Brian, on the portfolio, you mentioned application software probably heavy, network heavy. Is there any like kind of an obvious theme without giving away too much information from a competitive standpoint, but feel like there was an obvious medical theme for a while, an obvious infrastructure theme now. Is there something new that you're looking at or is it more fill-ins to existing kind of platforms that you have?
Brian Jellison: No. I think that there's some common themes that override that all the way, right? So we know the kind of business it's going to have, hopefully has deferred revenue, so we're paid in advance for what we do. And it's going to have high margins, it's going to have the sort of mid-single-digit growth or better often times. And it's going to be something that's niche, that's critical to the customer that's actually making the decision to deploy it. It's not going to be something that goes to some value-added reseller that's making adjustments to it. It's not going to be software that the customer itself is using to rewrite stuff. It's going to have some implementation service associated with it that we're not going to spend a huge amount of time servicing it over a long period of time. And the market, it's going to be something that the customer allows him to make more money so that his decision about what he's willing to pay for the software or network access that he's getting from us is a no-brainer for him. And so then it's really the kind of thing -- I mean, I can't describe the ones we're looking at now. But each one of those, they're not huge revenue companies of their own right but they're controlling billions of dollars of revenue. And so people really want them. And that's true of a whole lot of things. I mean, you can think about like a toll tag business, well, gee, it's a couple hundred million. Well, no, it's bringing in maybe $85 billion. Gee, it's a trade network at a grocery chain at $100-plus million of revenue. No, it's $8 billion of transactions. So the kind of things that our people do have very far reaching broad applications with lots of money involved, just it's not our revenue. And those are the kinds of networks and software applications that we're looking at right now.
Joseph Giordano: Is there anything on the application side around Neptune? I feel like there's been a lot more kind of technology going through the metering channels there. Is that something that Neptune is just doing organically on their own? Or is there maybe opportunities there to add more on like the analytics kind of software side there to that business?
Brian Jellison: Well, we have some other investments and activity that help support that. But what happens at Neptune is that as we build -- everybody else kind of went with one idea and they're trying to drive one idea. And what Neptune has done is by making everything backward-compatible, when you take something that's really quite old, still allow a customer to move forward without having to change out everything, and that's an invaluable thing. Other people force dramatic change on customers, and a lot of them don't like that. So that's an important part. I mean, Rob, you may want to add to the -- of course, we've established an Atlanta technology center, it's a big deal and we're staffing that rapidly?
Robert Crisci: Yes, that's exactly right. So we have been investing organically in software in Neptune quite a while and that continues to ramp. And as Brian said, we are doing that in Atlanta. A lot of exciting things. I mean, it's such a great customer base. Our solutions really drive the ability for the customers to collect the revenue and I think there's a lot more things we can do to continue to help the customers get better over time. And we're making those investments today that we feel confident will pay off in the future.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.
Alexander Blanton: I wanted to ask about what you said about compressor controls. You said that the -- I believe you said that the orders were coming in better than expected for 2019 projects, is that correct?
Brian Jellison: No, I wouldn't say, Alex, those were orders, but we're seeing a lot of activity. And so if you went back to the bigger LNG [indiscernible], $30 billion kind of projects that people knew would be out in five years. What we're seeing is a lot of smaller projects in the $1 million to $2 million arena that people are considering for 2019. But we wouldn't see an order for those until 2019 and then delivery in '19 and '20.
Alexander Blanton: Okay. So indications, future orders are better than expected. What's the reason for that? Why do you...
Brian Jellison: Some of it is around exports, some of it is around people seeing an opportunity for some of the things to be profitable that they thought maybe couldn't be profitable before. How much of it is the pricing mechanisms they're seeing, it's really hard to say. Each one of those customers has got his own concept about why he's talking to us, but the important thing for us is they're talking to us. And 12 months ago or 15 months ago, we weren't having any of those conversations with anybody.
Alexander Blanton: Is that partly related to the price of gas, you think?
Brian Jellison: I just don't think -- we're not going to make that call. I mean it could be. You'd have to ask each one of them, right? So these are big guys. It's certainly got to be related to their view of macroeconomics, whether that's the price of oil or a change in the ability to export or something around LNG projects or the fact that they've under invested for a very, very long time and eventually have to -- and they're beginning to start that cycle on getting back to upgrading their older areas.
Alexander Blanton: Yes, well, the lower price of gas should lead to greater usage of gas, and that would help you. Second question is on the first quarter tax rate, I might have missed it, did you explain why it was only 18% versus 23% for the rest of the year?
Robert Crisci: Yes, just timing on deductions related to stock-based compensation.
Alexander Blanton: Okay. And thirdly, I don't have a really good sense of where the energy segment is relative to the past peak. That business fell way down a couple years ago. And just where are we relative to the past peak?
Brian Jellison: It's still probably off by at least 40% from the peak. The one business that's actually ahead of its peak, and it's Cornell Pump, and that's because it's not much an energy business. They do a lot of club sale directly on packaging stuff. But Roper Pump, [indiscernible], Viatran, and [indiscernible] are directly upstream guys, so let's say, they're up 35%, but they were down 60.
Alexander Blanton: Right. So if you're off still 40% from the peak, what's going to take to get back to that peak? And when?
Robert Crisci: Yes, so all balanced, right? We have the midstream and downstream businesses that have not bounced back similar to the upstream yet, we still have -- the reason why we're excited about these green shoots of optimism for compressor control is going out a year or two, is it still hasn't really rebounded because it's very late cycle. But again, as you know, Alex, this is a really small part of Roper now from a percent standpoint. It's very difficult for us to predict if we ever get back to those levels or not. What we can be sure that our business leaders are going to execute very well in the environment they're in as they have done, and now they're getting very good leverage as the business has grown. That's really what we ask them to do versus us making long-term macro predictions.
Alexander Blanton: Right. But you've still got plenty of potential there, correct? In that segment?
Brian Jellison: Well, it's true, but it's still a very small part of the total. I mean, these businesses are never going to get back to be 15% or 20% of Roper.
Robert Crisci: Well, under 10%.
Brian Jellison: Not going to be there. They're going to be single digits of our portfolio.
Robert Crisci: Right. That's correct.
Operator: And that will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q4  (2018-02-02 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Brian Jellison - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer Robert Crisci - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Neil Hunn - Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer Zack Moxcey - Vice President, Investor Relations
Analysts: Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer Robert McCarthy - Stifel Joe Giordano - Cowen Unknown Analyst - JP Morgan Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Richard Eastman - Baird
Operator: Welcome to the Roper Technologies Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results conference call. We’ll now begin. Please note today’s call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, Jim, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the fourth quarter and full year financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Neil Hunn, Executive Vice President, Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O’Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.  Earlier this morning we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today’s call. We have prepared slides to accompany today’s call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you’ll please turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today’s call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC’s filings. You should listen to today’s call in the context of that information. Now please turn to Slide 3. Today we will discuss our results for the fourth quarter and year primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is on our press release and also included as part of this presentation on our website. For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items on a pre-tax basis: a $215 million one-time net gain resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; a $73 million adjustment for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and lastly an $8 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquired deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions and $1 million of related commission expense. This represents revenue and commissions that those companies would have recognized if not for our acquisition. Now if you’ll please turn to Slide 4, I’ll hand the call over to Brian. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: Thank you, Zack, and good morning everybody. We have four categories here - we’ll look at the Q4 and full-year 2017 financial results, and we’ll look at the 2017 segment detail and how it sets us up for our 2018 segment outlook. You’ll see throughout the discussion, once we get into the segments, that the segments have really changed pretty dramatically over the last several years. They’ve become much more diverse, which creates some opportunity for us that we’re going to try to exploit here shortly. In 2018, we’ll show you the enterprise guidance for the year and then take your questions. Next slide. If we look at the quarter, it really was a terrific quarter. We had record results on revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow, cash conversion was spectacular, revenue was up 21%. We had organic 5% growth in the fourth quarter, which was similar to what we enjoyed throughout the year and what we’re likely to see next year as well. Gross margin was up 30 basis points in the quarter to 62.6%. This is keeping us comfortably ahead of any cost push inflation. There certainly is some of that, that you can see, but we think we have that well in hand.  Our debts were up 23% to 270, and I’m sure this will be one of those quarters that will be fascinating to read the headlines because good old GAAP, of course, incorporates the $215 million tax benefit one-time for the fourth quarter, so in GAAP we did 427. As always, we like the adjusted earnings because it paints a much more clear picture, and in fact we did 270 on adjusted earnings. EBITDA was up 21% to $441 million in the quarter. Our operating cash flow was remarkable - it was up 36%. We did $369 million of operating cash flow on revenue of $1.230 billion.  Deltek and ConstructConnect had great fourth quarters but actually for the full year beat all of our revenue and cash flow assumptions. During the full year, we reduced $1.06 billion of debt, even though we did a couple of small deals, so that deleveraging, you’ll see how much that benefits us shortly. Next slide. Our Q4 income statement, here you can see the nominal numbers that are available for all of you. Importantly, the tax rate, you can see in the fourth quarter was 26.9%. Generally I think we were guiding around 29%, maybe a little less in the fourth quarter, so we got a slight benefit out of tax. Net earnings were $280 million. Next slide. Here, we have all four of the segments for the fourth quarter on one slide here in terms of the numerical impact. You can see it was truly a terrific quarter, and most importantly it supports a really good start into 2018. In the RF segment, it was up organically 4% if we exclude toll and traffic, which always has some lumpy characteristics, so it is down 1% organically but it’s of no consequence. The acquisitions of course drove all of the terrific benefits, so revenue was up 45%, EBITDA was up 47%. I think some people missed the fact there was a stub period for Deltek and ConstructConnect in the fourth quarter last year - it’s important to understand that. We treated all of the revenue and income as acquisition-related, even though we could have called some of this organic. On the medical side, you’ll see where revenue was up 4%, EBITDA was flat. We’ll talk a little bit about why that is and why that might continue for another few quarters, but energy and industrial of course had just spectacular results and unbelievable leverage. Energy was up 12% in revenue and up 11% in EBITDA, 9% organic growth. Industrial had 14% organic growth and was up a total 16%, so it was a really terrific quarter. Next slide. As we shift now to a discussion about the full year, which helps position us when we think about what our guidance is for ’18, here you can see for the full year we had organic growth of 5%. We were up 23 on revenue. Gross profit was up 90 basis points. You know, when you’re running at 61.7 in ’16, to be able to add 90 basis points of gross profit just says a ton about the quality of the management inside our company. Net earnings, you can see are up dramatically here, and the $975 million in net earnings of course doesn’t deal with how much better cash conversion we have, and we’ll talk about that.  Tax rate for the year was 28.9%. We expected it to be somewhere around 30. With the new tax reform as we talk about it later, we’ll probably pick up 7%, maybe 8% lower tax rate for 2018.  Next slide. For the full year, and it really is a remarkable year, we were up $860 million on revenue from $3.8 billion to $4.665 billion, so we continue to inch closer to a $5 billion revenue threshold. EBITDA was up $290 million and operating cash flow after last year for the first time in history just getting over a billion dollars. We added $233 million to that this year to bring it up to $1.234 billion.  Next slide. On compounding our cash flow here at cash conversion, you can see on Slide 10 that our free cash flow closed out the year at $1.175 billion, up 22% from last year’s $961 billion, so cash clearly remains the best measure of performance in a world of adjusted commentary. So the cash is pretty clear - it was $200 million more than our net earnings.  Our full-year operating cash flow was 26% of revenue. Our free cash flow was 25% of revenue. That gave us a free cash flow conversion of 121% - of course, on a GAAP basis it’s dramatically higher, and then we reduced our debt by $1.06 billion, so that deleveraging you’ll see in a second is pretty powerful. Next slide. Our asset-light business model continues to just plug along, so we closed the year for the first time in our history with a negative working capital number. You can see on this slide that year-end ’15, we had 4.3% net working capital, and then in ’16 it was down to 2.7%. This year, it’s a negative number - 3.3%. I always like to look back and see how we’re doing relative to five and 10 years ago. Five years ago, not a long time, December ’12 we were at--inventory was 5.9% of our revenue annualized, and now it’s 4.2%; receivables were 18.5%, and now they’re 16%; payables were 11.6% and now they’re 12%; deferred revenue was 5.7% and now it’s 11.4%, and when you add those columns together, you go from 7% net working capital in 2012, push forward five years and we’re at a negative 3.3%. You know, 10% of our revenue would be about $500 million that we do not have to have tied up in any way in these net working capitals, so really as we grow now, growth becomes a source of cash instead of a use of cash. At deferred revenue, you can see we closed the year out at $566 million. By the way, if I look back 10 years ago at the end of ’07, our net working capital number when we started this process was 13% versus 3.3% now. Next slide. Wow, the balance sheet should be glowing neon for you. You can see cash is $671 million, and finally that cash number, really when you look at net debt to EBITDA means something because that cash is no longer trapped outside the United States. We look at paying down a billion dollars of debt, so gross debt went from $6.2 billion to $5.156 billion. If we didn’t do any deals this year and paid down another billion, it’d be down to $4 billion, and you know the EBITDA is going to be higher than what you’ve got - we’d be at a two times debt to EBITDA, so you can be assured we’re going to be doing deals. Our net debt number at 4.4 divided by our already reported trailing EBITDA gives you a 2.8 debt to EBITDA number before we get any new cash this year, and that compares to our close-out in ’16 of 4.1. I doubt many people could do the kind of cash flow we do and maintain the discipline to drop in a one-year period from over 4 times debt to EBITDA to less than 3. It’s really great performance from all of our leaders.  Next slide. Tax reform is just a marvelous thing for us. It benefits us in many, many ways. First, our tax rate is likely to come in around 21 to 23% for ’18, and this gives us more earnings and more cash flow. We’re going to be able to repatriate over $500 million rather quickly from our offshore cash, and that really adds to our acquisition capacity immediately. The mobility of worldwide cash is a huge benefit because in the past, 20 to 25% of our earnings and cash flow were coming from outside the U.S. from our great businesses there, but they tended to put pressure on you to invest in other non-U.S. areas. Now, we no longer have that constraint and we can deploy capital wherever we want to. The way I look at this is really you have the lower tax rate, higher cash flow, and then access to global cash is a perfect trifecta for Roper. We couldn’t ask for more, and I guarantee we’ll use it well. Next slide. Before we get into the segment detail, I want to tell you a couple of things we’re doing here to kind of facilitate some things around the segments. First, our segments have really changed significantly, and you’ll see that as I talk about the four current reporting segments. Those changes have created some structural oddities for us about who reports to whom and how did these things get done, and there are some opportunities for us to do a better job in cleaning this up going forward. This is really the optimum time for us to take a look at how we’re structured, so one of the things that we’re going to do to accommodate that is to appoint Neil Hunn effective today as not only Executive Vice President but our Chief Operating Officer. That’s going to help us with a process Neil and I have been working on about how we think we might want to look at realigning these segments, and while certainly it says a lot about Neil and our long-term succession, this is less about our succession and a whole lot more about getting the company structured so it’s less opaque and easier for us to talk to investors about our growth over the next three years. Next slide. On the RF technology and software segment, here you can see this is such a screaming example of why we need to do some things. This segment has been dominated by toll and traffic for years - it was always over half of the revenue. Today with the Deltek and ConstructConnect acquisitions, project management, application software, the products that we have, that’s over 75% of our total segment now, and the toll and traffic business is only about 25%. While it will grow, it will continue to wither away in terms of its contribution to the segment. We spent a very substantial amount of time in the fourth quarter of this year doing very extensive three-year strategic plan reviews with all the people in this segment, and they have widely diverse end markets, as you can see. If you look over here for ’17, Deltek and ConstructConnect exceeded what we expected on revenue and cash flow. Deltek had great balance across their govcon business and professional services, and a little acquisition we did called Onvia is going to strengthen their market intelligence subscription platform and is off to a good start in that respect. ConstructConnect’s network grew dramatically and it’s going to continue to drive recurring revenue growth. We had about 5% organic growth across all the software segments, with Freight Match and Aderant being the leaders in that. Our RF products, which is RF IDeas and Ivonics Technolog, also had positive growth. Toll and traffic, on the other hand, while they had great project execution on the MTA project in New York and Saudi, we had very low tag shipments in the first quarter of the year, and it improved throughout the year but still wound up being just pretty modest in terms of what it contributed for the year. As we look at 2018, Deltek, which will be totally organic in 2018, and ConstructConnect will certainly help our numbers in this area. We think that the software businesses ought to grow 5 to 6%, and they come in with very strong margin and cash performance. The RF products are sort of similar or a little less in gross margins, but quite good EBITDA performance and they’re growing pretty quickly. On the toll and traffic situation, we think that’s likely to be flat in 2018, although the pipeline for opportunities is the most robust it’s ever been, just that the timing is difficult to forecast. Lastly, you’ll continue to see acquisitions in both the application software side and the project management software side in various niches. I would imagine we’ll add to both of our large platforms here and you’ll see some new niches that come in application software. Next slide. If we look at the medical and scientific imaging, here again you’ll see some sector things that not everything fits together perfectly. On the medical side, we have a medical products business that’s the largest business we have in this segment, and that’s in terms of revenues led by Verathon, in terms of growth as led by Northern Digital and CIVCO. A very successful product launch late in fourth quarter on what’s called GlideScope Go, which is a portable product, and then a new BladderScan product, so we expect very strong second half of the year performance out of these launches.  Our alternate site healthcare business had another good year, broad-based growth in the long-term GPO segment, and then our software businesses that support that. Our acute care software business, which is a family of independent businesses wrapped together here around the hospital software arena, had very strong growth from our decision support SaaS business, which is Strata. The diagnostic connectivity business, which is Data Innovation and International Solutions, we won a very significant Queensland project for Sunquest International Lab business. The good news about that is it’s going to be somewhere between AUD$50 million and AUD$100 million over the next several years; the bad news is this year it’s going to require mostly upfront investment as we prepare to launch all of those things. The U.S. lab business continues to be challenged. It’s really been challenged now for two years, and we’ve introduced some new products and the good thing is the new products are being picked up--they’re getting picked up as upgrades, and we’re not having success in new suites being applied to the U.S. lab business. So as we’ve looked a great deal about that and spent--actually had a board meeting out there in September, had a really deep dive and things--you know, what we think is that U.S. lab business, which is a high margin business, will probably decline sort of mid single digits for another two years before rebounding. In the scientific imaging business, we’ve had sort of a breakthrough. Fourth quarter was just beyond spectacular in orders for our cryo-EM products, and that’s going to carry over very, very impactfully in 2018. If we look at the right-hand side for ’18, you can see we’re forecasting 4 to 6% organic revenue growth for the segment, and we might do even better than that; but the margins will probably come down 100 basis points, and I want to point out that the margin for ’17 was far and away--it’s the highest margin segment. It was just under 43%, and we think in ’18 it’s going to be between 41 and 42%. Really, everything in here is doing fine, it’s just the drag for another year or two on the U.S. lab business with high margin contribution sort of gives us less than wonderful looking leverage, but we’ll be up both in revenue and EBITDA in this segment in 2018. Medical products and alternate sites are going to continue to have broad-based growth in ’18, and certainly Strata and our international business growth is going to be robust, and then it gets offset a little bit by the U.S. lab business. Imaging will be strong because Gatan has record backlog and solid delivery projects for Q2 and Q3. Next slide. On the industrial technology area, you can see the performance is--wow, if that’s all you had, what an unbelievable thing. Record year for Neptune - they continue to gain market share despite what you might hear from others. Excellent growth from our fluid handling businesses. We certainly had a rebound at our Roper pump business around upstream oil and gas, tremendous performance out at Cornell Pump with a lot of rental markets for dewatering activity. Operating leverage in this segment was above 40%. We expect to have 5 to 7% organic growth in 2018, and there are some people who think it might be even better. On the energy side, again a great story - over 50% operating leverage from nimble execution with our leaders. We had broad-based growth throughout the segment, and frankly CCC’s declines were more modest than we might have expected. Again, probably 5 to 7% organic growth in 2018, very strong leverage. There is just nothing you can say but good things about both of these segments. Next slide. As we look at 2018 guidance - next slide, we establish guidance for the year at $10.88 a share on the low end to $11.20 on the high end. That gives us organic revenue growth of 4 to 5%, maybe a little more. Tax rate is a little hard to plug in there - you know, use 22, you’re probably relatively safe, but it could be down to 21, could be up a little higher. In the first quarter, we establish guidance of 244 to 250. We’ll have a little bit lower tax rate in Q1 than we will for the rest of the year, so tax rate in the first quarter will certainly be less than 20% and then throughout the rest of the year it will bring us up to this 21 to 23% average. Next slide. In terms of a summary around ’17 and looking forward to ’18, certainly our asset-light niche market strategy continues to deliver outstanding performance, greater than 20% growth in all of these categories - revenue, earnings, EBITDA, and cash flow. What was also encouraging is the consistency and broad-based organic growth that we had, and we see that continuing into ’18. Deltek and ConstructConnect exceeded our expectations for the year - I think they had about $35 million in Q416 stub revenue that you might want to go back and see, so they really did well. Our ability to compound cash has dramatically changed. With the billion debt pay down, the balance sheet is pristine once again. Tax reform is just going to continue to compound more cash flow and an ability of us to deploy capital, and the net working capital is now a source of cash, so it’s pretty unusual to have a growth strategy in which you don’t have to invest to capture the opportunity. The CRI disciplines that we use in capital deployment you can assure will continue to be deployed, and as we told you the last time, we thought we’d probably do around $6 billion over the next four years or so, but in reality we’ll be upping that because we’re going to get at least a $250 million annual benefit in terms of how we can leverage the company with tax reform. So we’re now thinking we’ll do $7 billion or more over the next four-year period, hard to predict exactly when those numbers come to pass. Certainly we don’t budget a particular number for a year, but we would expect to be above $7 billion when we look back four years from now, and Neil and I have maybe done a little work on getting these structures a little easier to manage, so I’m looking forward to that. It was a truly remarkable year and we entered 2018 with terrific momentum. With that, we’d like to open it up to questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] We’ll take our first question from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. 
Deane Dray: Thank you, good morning everyone. 
Brian Jellison: Hey, good morning Deane.
Deane Dray: Congrats to Neil in his new role at COO. First question, maybe take us through the dynamics in the fourth quarter in RF technology - it came in lighter both top line and earnings versus our expectations. I know there were some puts and takes in the quarter and you had called out last quarter there was some pull-in into the third quarter for Deltek - I don’t know if that was a factor, or if this was that stub from a year ago. But could you take us through that for starters, please?
Brian Jellison: Rob is chomping at the bit.
Robert Crisci: Hi Deane, good morning. Yes, so it was right in line with our model on EBITDA. We actually were a little bit above our internal guidance model on EBITDA for the segment. We were a little light on revenue - I think we guided to low single digits and it came in minus-1, just because of the difficult MTA comp versus last year and timing on some of the TransCore projects. But it really was in line with our model, so I think, not to speak for the analysts, but it seems like the analysts may have missed the fact that we did have this $35 million or so of revenue last year, and it seems like people weren’t taking that into account when they were doing their RF estimate for Q4. So from our perspective, in line, and more importantly really exceeded in terms of cash flow. The cash flow performance in the quarter was better than we expected, again driven by the new acquisitions, Deltek and ConstructConnect, and really good performance there. So from our viewpoint, it was a solid quarter in RF.
Brian Jellison: I just want to reassert that Deltek and ConstructConnect outperformed in the fourth quarter versus our model. It solely centers on the intelligent traffic system side of project management at TransCore.
Deane Dray: Got it, and then how about just the--expand more on the tax reform impact. Rob, can you just kind of take us through the details of how you work through the implications for Roper’s tax position for 2018 and beyond? What swings you from 21 to 23 - we had been modeling 23, and what might be the dynamic in the first quarter that would be taking you lower than that?
Robert Crisci: Yes, sure. So like every other company out there, there was a lot of work done, and I commend our tax department - they’ve been working long hours all the month of January to really get all this work done in time for the earnings call and, of course, the 10-K coming up. So yes, I think as Brian mentioned, we’re probably--we had to give a point estimate, it’s probably around 22% is our long-term, right? We wanted to give a range because there are some moving parts, and so it’s always difficult when you’re under a new law here to make sure you get everything ironed out, but I think that we’re pretty comfortable with that 22% number over the long term. As far as Q1, there are some discrete items, particularly around the deductions for compensation that would drive Q1 a little lower, as Brian mentioned probably a little under 20%. But you know, on a full-year long term, certainly if you want to put 22 in the model, it’s probably a fine number.
Deane Dray: Got it. Then if I can sneak one more question in, maybe hear from Neil, just broad brush - you may be early in the process, but what might we be seeing in the way of a re-segmentation? It sounds like that’s one of the first orders of business for you.
Brian Jellison: I’ll give him a second to respond, but the thing is that most of the businesses report to either Neil or myself, so if you look at the way we’re structured in RF, one of our key leaders is Tracy Marks that’s over the ITS business. Another really key leader is Mike Corkery, who is over Deltek. It’s our largest business. If you put the two largest revenue businesses really are the TransCore piece and the Deltek piece, they have, as you might guess, absolutely nothing to do with each other, so we have got this segment and there is a whole lot of other things that are a products piece, some of those report to Paul Soni, others report to Claude Pumilia, and what we’ve found over the last year is we’ve done some pretty significant talent upgrades, because as we’re interviewing people, shockingly most people would like to know who they’re going to report to and which businesses they have responsibility for, and we would be embarrassed if--you know, when we try to explain how the labyrinth works. So I’d like to have some time here with Neil looking at how I’ve kind of viewed the company since 2016. You know, we have products that are divided really into a couple of large categories, and those subcategories are precision technology, fluid handling, medical products and RF products. On the other side, we have our software businesses, and they really have kind of four subcategories. You have our healthcare software business, you have our alternate site business, you have our application software business, and you have our project management business. We’ve tried to maintain the same segment reporting for probably a little longer than we should. This won’t really have an effect on how the 50 P&Ls in the company work, but it will have an effect on how Neil and I are looking at forward structure and long-term executive leadership positions.  So inside that, then, it’s all yours.
Neil Hunn: Yes, the only thing I would add, Deane, is this is about how we organize ourselves, not how we operate the businesses. I’d just leave it there and look forward to unveiling more of that as Brian and I work through it in the next few quarters. 
Deane Dray: Great, thank you.
Operator: Moving on, we’ll take our next question from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks, good morning. Good to see the free cash flow conversion remains best in class after the switch to adjusted net income. Relative to the 121% this year, is that a good proxy for how the cash flow versus the A&I is structured?
Robert Crisci: Yes, so I would say long term, excellent year in 2017. If I had to give you a 2018, we’d probably be 120% conversation on OCF, maybe 115% on free cash flow is sort of a framework. I think the 2017 performance was exceptional and we might be able to do that again, but we’ll certainly always be running at 120% OCF conversion to the new adjusted net earnings, so I’m always trying to clarify. We don’t really report cash EPS, we reported adjusted EPS, and our cash is quite a bit higher than that.
Christopher Glynn: Right, great. Thanks Rob. Brian, since you brought it up, even though you downplayed it, how would you comment on the timeline around ultimate succession?
Brian Jellison: Who knows, three to five years? I think--I have an obligation to notify the board two years in advance, and I haven’t done it, so this is not about succession. What this is, is an opportunity for Neil, who’s worked at a yeoman way with everybody on our strategic planning process, where he and I just spend much more time together as we’re developing what we’re doing, so I used to--I think we were, like, 78, and I think the board was recently upping the retirement age to 80, so I’ll be here for some time. I expect to be here during the deployment of the next $7 billion - I’ll leave it at that.
Christopher Glynn: Great, thanks.
Operator: Moving on, we’ll take our next question from Robert McCarthy from Stifel.
Robert McCarthy: Good morning everyone. Congratulations on a strong end of the year and a constructive guide for ’18. I think I had just two questions. Back on the expiration of the segments, and I think I know the answer to this and it might be a high decibel answer from Brian nevertheless, you guys were pretty clear that this is about how you organize, not about how you run the underlying businesses. But you are a collection of businesses, of high quality businesses that you’ve acquired over time with entrepreneurs or hard-charging execs in those roles, and is this going to lead to potentially some consolidation of those roles or new faces? In other words, do you think of this change of how you’re operating from maybe more of a feudal system with some guidance above to more centralized management of the businesses? 
Brian Jellison: I don’t see anything around centralized management. You’d have to probably educate me about the feudal concept. We don’t have any serfs, and you’re right to describe our people the way you do. We actually sent a note out this morning to the people, and the note says, this probably will have nothing to do with any of your independent businesses. I don’t think it will have much. We’ve never found consolidating things and internal synergies are really that great. We do think a focus on long-term growth is pretty important, and I think that there are processes that we’ve been putting in place around strategic deployment and strategy that Neil can be really gifted at working with all of our people with. So I’m sort of hoping for maybe a little bit better long-term sustainable organic growth power with this, but it doesn’t change anything for individual businesses. It’s not--it’s just better to have all the operating people ultimately reporting to one person. Then I think long term when you think about succession, I mean, knowing Neil as well as I do and our culture, my guess is that at some point, Neil will say that that role doesn’t need to exist anymore. So it’s just a nice transition opportunity for us to get everybody on the same page. Neil, you may want to add to that?
Neil Hunn: The only thing I’d add is this business has been built over a long time with a system that’s about the niche orientation, the resource allocation decisions being made at the field, the field operators being held accountable to results, and I don’t see any of that changing for a very, very long time, if ever. I mean, it works for us and it will continue to work.
Robert McCarthy: Thanks for that helpful clarification, because obviously that’s been the secret to your existing and continuing success. A related question to that is do you anticipate the output of this analysis or this process that you’re putting together, could this lead potentially to perhaps identifying businesses that are non-core and perhaps would be better served as a separate entity? I mean, obviously this is the old chestnut of the break-up of Roper or a spin of certain more cyclically or capital-intensive businesses of Roper.
Brian Jellison: Well, we’ve talked about that, not at great--the company is not going to break up, period, end of discussion. We might divest some things or we might spin some minor thing. Actually, what’s happened is tax reform makes portfolio adjustment way more attractive when you think about divestments, so as you know, these businesses have been around forever so they have almost no tax basis, so whatever you sell them for, if you’re paying 35%, it’s just hopeless; but if you’re only paying 21%, it might be a little less hopeless depending on what you’re using with the cash you get out of that business. So there’s probably a little--I’d say there’s a modest uptick in our willingness to divest something than we would have had three years ago and further. Most all of our businesses, if they aren’t software related, they still have firmware in their products and they’re communicating. There are only a small number of our businesses that are not like that, and so--but we will take a hard look at those businesses and what’s the optimum use of them. 
Robert McCarthy: If I can sneak just one more in real quick, you’ve made a comment about obviously perhaps an increased focus on U.S. M&A from the standpoint of the ability to redeploy capital here - I think it was a comment on one of the slides, but could you comment on that, and then just comment--I mean, you look at what basically software has done for you in terms of creating a better, more fertile opportunity set of M&A, because you’ve basically been able to find businesses that are around information domain management and then automate them through software or have a subscription business - you know, basically the SaaS model. Has there been any changes in technology in the last five years that creates even more fertile ground for more opportunity for a different kind of software business, and comment on the relative appetite of businesses perhaps in the U.S.
Brian Jellison: Well, the technology is not the driving force there. The driving force is that you have, say, 20 or 25% of your cash that you’re generating each year is offshore, and you can’t repatriate it without a big penalty. Instead of having 100% of your cash flow generation being able to go to deployment activity, you only have 75%. So now we have 100% and we’re not constrained. A lot of the software niches that we buy are U.S.-centric businesses as opposed to global businesses, and so having 100% of your cash available to deploy on those U.S. niche businesses is very likely to lead to us buying more U.S. niche businesses that will get hooked up with Deltek and ConstructConnect and Aderant. That’s the reason we’re sort of raising what we expect to deploy on capital.  Now you know, it could be the next acquisition we announce will be a German company, but we’re live on four things now and they’re all software-related, and most of them are U.S.-centric. 
Robert McCarthy: Thus endeth the lesson. 
Brian Jellison: There you go.
Operator: Moving on, we’ll take our next question from Joe Giordano from Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Hey guys, good morning. I just wanted to start with your comments on U.S. lab. Are we talking Sunquest specifically here, and how would you categorize that dynamic now? Is it more market-based, is it a share loss kind of situation, is it a combo, and how does this kind of change your outlook onto bolt-ons to supplement that business? I know you’ve made a few in the past, and is that less likely now?
Brian Jellison: No. The bolt-ons in the business are performing outstandingly well. Those are all double-digit growers, they’re doing exceptionally well. It’s just that the U.S. lab business is in a unique couple of year situation where people are rolling out their ERP that they have acquired over the last X-years, so you went through a period of artificial stimulation with meaningful use at the beginning when we acquired Sunquest. We knew that - that wasn’t a surprise for us, and as that disappeared, what replaced it was the rollout of various ERP projects in which Sunquest was oftentimes the niche lab provider but isn’t going to get renewed at some point in time when that ERP is put in place. That process started to hurt us two years ago and hurt us a little more last year, not going to be helpful this year or next. We already know who all those are, so we expect to [indiscernible] 5 or 6% of our install base to the ERP people. That will stop, and then I think we’ll not only continue to have some sort of modest single-digit growth but we’re likely to start selling and replacing some of the people who tried cumbersome ERP systems that are not good for the laboratory.  So we’re going to go through this period where the CFO is winning at the expense of the laboratory guy, but at the end of the day, the cost to the hospital we think is minimized with our technology.
Joe Giordano: Fair enough. Then on the TransCore side, is there something that we have to think about from a structural margin perspective related to tags, and we’re seeing more of these systems go in that are camera-based where you don’t need a tag and it just flashes against your license plate. Is that a structural shift in the market that we have to think about the margin dynamics of that business a little bit differently?
Brian Jellison: Well you know, the tags are relatively high margin compared to any of the project work, but all the other technology, we still lead in all the other technology, so if you’re looking at readers and cameras, we actually use our Luminara brand cameras for a whole bunch of the things you’re talking about, and those businesses all have decent margins. It’s just that as the project business continues to grow, and it’s growing at the expense of other public companies that I really shouldn’t name, and all you have to do is read about their total malaise, but the margins associated with our project business are the worst we have. They’re best in class for TransCore - their results are spectacular, but for us they’re a drag on our margins. I don’t think that’s going to change anytime soon.
Robert Crisci: I would just add, even with the camera technology, you still need that tag. I mean, that’s the whole point, is the tag allows the agency to properly collect the funds from the user. The camera is just a back-up, and so you’re always going to have the tag.
Joe Giordano: But don’t a lot of the systems now just take a print of your license plate and mail you a bill in the mail? That’s what a lot of the ones in New York have now, right? 
Brian Jellison: Absolutely some of the ones are license plate drive, but it’s still our collection technology, and oftentimes it’s our collection administration -you know, somebody gets a call for a bill payment, it’s actually our admin people masquerading as whatever the tolling authority in the area is. That’s the big administrative business we’re talking about, which continues to grow at the expense of others but is a little less exciting for us. Its growth will always diminish our gross margins. 
Joe Giordano: Last from me, the delivery of imaging backlog - you know, we’ve been waiting for the cryo-EM stuff we’ve been talking about for a while. How much is that contributing to your lower margin comments for the medical segment? I figure that would be kind of good on top line but mix negative for you guys, I’d assume, right?
Robert Crisci: Yes, so those are good margin products. Their shipments are skewed towards Q2 and Q3, so in Q1 the margin performance of the medical segment is going to be lower than on a full-year basis, so it will be down more than 100 basis points because we’re not yet getting the shipments. Also, a lot of the start-up costs around Australia are hitting in the first quarter, so once you get into Q2, Q3, I would say the margins are not--it’s probably in line with the segment, it’s not really a big headwind with the mix. 
Joe Giordano: Okay.
Brian Jellison : Yes, the medical segment margins are going to be 41 to 42% EBITDA, for heaven’s sake. They’re still going to be the highest in the company.
Joe Giordano: Fair enough. Thanks guys.
Operator: Moving on, we’ll take our next question from Steve Tusa from JP Morgan.
Unknown Analyst: Hey guys, this is actually [indiscernible] on for Steve Tusa. Just had a few questions. I didn’t hear it mentioned, but just wondering did you guys see any impacts from or will you see any impacts from the revenue recognition accounting change ASC 606?
Robert Crisci: Yes, thanks for asking. We are of course adopting that this year, but the impact is less than we probably would have originally estimated before we did all the work. It will be a $15 million or so impact to deferred revenue on the balance sheet as of January 1 of this year, but then the revenue recognized under the new standard will actually make up that number during ’18, so on a net basis we don’t see it having any impact to our earnings, so it’s going to be something that will of course flow through our GAAP earnings but not something that we feel necessary to call out for any sort of an adjustment, because there really isn’t going to be much of a net impact. But that’s the reason [indiscernible] going through every single one of our companies. Revenue recognition is really a project that’s been going on here the last six months-plus, led by Jason Conley and the accounting department, so we feel very good about that . 
Unknown Analyst: Got it, cool. Thanks for the clarification. Then for the other segments outside medical, can you give a sense of the operating leverage targets? Is 40% a good ballpark to think about year-over-year, operating margin leverage?
Brian Jellison: The enterprise probably comes in in the 30%-plus leverage category with medical’s leverage being less and then industrial and energy, you’d expect 40% leverage plus in those. In RF, it’s kind of a--I mean, it will have high leverage, it’s just what the revenue is, is tough to pick because of TransCore, so probably more like 35 in RF.
Unknown Analyst: Got it, that’s helpful. Lastly for me, do you have a sense of timing or likely timing around when we’re going to learn about some decisions around the segment restructuring? 
Brian Jellison: Oh, it could take a year - who knows? We’ve been talking about this since 2016, and there’s a lot of moving parts plus we have acquisitions that will be going on. But part of it is just finding a better way to nest the acquisitions into segments that make a lot of clarity, right?
Unknown Analyst: Yes, okay, got it. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Moving on, we’ll take our next question from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.
Jeff Sprague: Thank you, good morning everyone. Just two quick ones from me. Brian, is it inconceivable that you could do some M&A in industrial or energy when we think about the technology overlap and infiltration that we’re starting to see into industrial markets?
Brian Jellison: It’s not inconceivable. I mean, we’re looking at one, sort of a--to the degree we ever did one, we’re involved with one that’s pretty attractive. I don’t know that we’d get home on it, but if it was less around a mechanical product--I’d say we wouldn’t do it with a mechanical product. It would have to be something that had an algorithm associated with data collection, and there are an increasing number of those. So yes, I wouldn’t rule it out, it’s just unfortunately, Jeff, most of those come with more asset intensity than we like because--you know, if the need a factory as opposed to an assembly operation, then we probably wouldn’t do it.
Jeff Sprague: Great, and then just back again to the re-seg, not to minimize the complexity and the work you want to do, but it sounds like you have been thinking about it for a long time and you guys are pretty sharp guys, I would think you’ve got a pretty good sense of what you really want to do. I’m not sure what I’m missing on why it would take a year to figure all this out. Is there something more--
Brian Jellison: It’s a lot of people things, you know? We’ve got a lot of--we have spectacular people. The recent addition of--you know, you look at Aderant, we’ve got a terrific lady that’s running that, Deane Price. We’ve got Mike Corkery has terrific capacity - I’m sure he could be running our company. You’ve got Dave Conway, a lot of capacity, so it’s really a whole lot of it is around where are we investing in human capital.
Jeff Sprague: Right, makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Moving on, we’ll take our next question from Richard Eastman from Baird.
Richard Eastman: Hi, good morning. Could I just double back for a minute to the medical scientific? I’m just curious, Neil, perhaps could you just define how much of medical scientific, or in particular the medical software, acute care software is international versus U.S.? Perhaps just as a follow-on, speak to the investment that is going into the business - is it going in to make the software more appropriate for the international market? Where is the investment going that you speak to?
Neil Hunn: Of the acute care software grouping, it’s maybe 40% international, 60% U.S. The way that we think about the investment, as we’ve talked a couple times on this call, there is an investment in 2018 in the start-up in Queensland in Australia, so we’ve talked about that. In the U.S. market, it’s less about incremental new investments - we feel we have the right amount of R&D. It’s more about how you orient that and program the R&D dollars for the new products, and also how we--we have changed the way we attack the U.S. channel. We’ve realigned people, we’ve realigned the way they’re going to the market, we’ve added a few new managers in the business to think about that. So it’s more about reorienting what we’re doing in the U.S., so it’s not about incremental new investment there. 
Richard Eastman: Okay, and is any of that stepped up investment going to med products, or have we already funded that given some of the new products sent out to market on the BladderScan side?
Neil Hunn: There is in the medical products group, there is a fair amount of--there is a little bit of product investment year-over-year and there is a fair amount of channel investment across three or four of our businesses there that’s occurring in 2018. That’s a discrete item there.
Richard Eastman: Okay, thank you.
Operator: That will end our question and answer session for this call. We will now return back to Zack Moxcey for closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call. 
Operator: That will conclude today’s conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Roper Technologies Third Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like turn the conference over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
Zack Moxcey: Thank you, Lory, and thank you all for joining us this morning, as we discuss the third quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Neil Hunn, Executive Vice President; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We've prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast, and are also available on our website. Now, if you'll please turn to slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now, please turn to slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is on our press release and also included as a part of this presentation on our website. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items on a pre-tax basis: a $12 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions, and $1 million of related commission expense. This represents revenue and commissions that those companies would have recognized if not for our acquisition, and lastly $73 million adjustment for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.  And now, if you will please turn to slide 4, I will hand the call over to Brian. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: Thank you Zack and good morning everyone. I don’t know how many of you were fortunate enough to stay up last night as I was to watch the second best baseball game of all time; of course the Red Sox still are number one, but what an incredible game. And anyway I made it in, so I’m very happy about that.  If look here, we’ve got the Q3 enterprise financial results we’ll start with, and then get into the segment detail and the outlook, talk a little bit about Q4 and raising guidance for 2017 and sort of an initial outlook about 2018 and then take your questions and answers. So let’s go to the next slide.  The Q3 enterprise highlights here; our summary we had record third quarter results in about every category you can imagine, certainly sales and orders and gross margin, EBITDA etcetera, very encouraged by the fact that it was very broad based strength. We really only had one situation within medical products that’s sort of disappointing and one product portfolio business that we’ll discuss when we get into there. But notwithstanding that we still had incredible results for the quarter. Revenue was up 24% to $1.171 billion with 5% organic growth rate. The gross margin was 63%, up 170 basis points, and what we’re particularly encouraged by that is it demonstrates our ability we think to contain the cost push challenges that other people are complaining about with material and supply chain issues, and instead of having a problem we’re up a 170 basis points. Our diluted earnings per share were up 20% to $2.36, EBITDA was up 24% to 407 million and our margin expanded 20 basis points to 34.8%. Year-to-date, our operating cash flow has been 866 million, which represents $0.25 of every sales dollar, and that’s allowed us to reduce our debt year-to-date by $880 million. So that’s very rapid deleveraging bringing our debt-to-EBITDA number down dramatically. Great quarter and certainly strengthening the balance sheet was really a little bit above plan.  Next slide, if we look at the Q3 income statement, you can see our revenue in the quarter was up $224 million over the prior year. EBITDA was up 24%, tax rate was with– on our adjusted numbers we apply 35% tax rate and then on the rest of the business it came out at about 28%. So we got a 29.7% tax rate and we had expected something around 30%. And then you could see net earnings up $44 million to 245 million.  Next slide, here we look at how effective our cash flow strategy continues to be and how well our field people execute. So operating cash flow year-to-date is, as we said, 866 million, 25% of revenue. Our year-to-date free cash flow is 24% of revenue. One of the things we’d like to point out to people is there is not much CapEx here. So the difference between operating cash flow and free cash flow is only 1% of revenue. If you look back two years ago, you can see that our operating cash flow year-to-date in 2015 was 660 million. Last year, it went up by 71 million to 731 million. This year, it’s up by 135 million to 866 million. So that’s just in a two-year period, up 31%.  Our cash conversion which I hear some people stumbling around when I’m talking to folks. Our cash conversion on a GAAP basis is 156% year-to-date. It was higher than that in the third quarter actually around 160%. And our cash conversion on an adjusted net earnings number was up 118% year-to-date and up 124% in this quarter. So I do occasionally hear people talking about cash earnings versus our adjusted earnings. Our cash earnings are higher than the adjusted earnings that we report. We reduced debt by 880 million, as I said, and all of those things demonstrate our ability to compound cash.  Next slide; if we look at the asset-light business model, that’s certainly well and moving ahead. I always like to look at how much progress we’ve made. If you look back five years ago, our inventory was 7.2% of revenue and today it’s 4.5%. Receivables were 17.1%, today they are 16.4%. Payable and accruals were the same in both periods 12%. Our deferred revenue back then just five years ago was 3.4% of sales, today its 11.5%.  So five years ago, our total net number on working capital was 9% of revenue. Today it’s a negative number at 2.5%. We now have over $0.5 billion of deferred revenue, 535 million as you can see at the bottom of the slide. And the importance, of course, of the negative working capital is that we don’t need to add working capital as we grow. So we have this incredibly great model that as we grow we actually get oftentimes paid in advance for the work and so it actually strengthens the cash and our balance sheet as we grow.  All of this reflects the enterprise transformation that we’ve overtaken for a long period of time with particular effectiveness in the last five years, and it’s all really driven by our cost return on investment principles and discipline that we always like to talk about.  Next slide, here we’re just getting ready to get into the specific detail of the segments and the outlook, all of them performed very well. Their EBITDA margins were between 30% and 45% that really each one of them is sort of best-in-class for the platforms it represents.  Next slide, we thought we’d take a minute today to talk a little bit about the awards and milestones that have been accreting to the businesses, because they are really quite spectacular and we tend to talk about events within the quarter rather than the long-term trajectory of what’s going on here in these calls. And so many good things are happening around the future which I would just share a couple.  Gatan, which is in our scientific imaging segment but reported through medical created a technology a few years ago that was instrumental in identifying the Zika virus. And the technology that we have allows Cryo-Electron Microscopy to see things that wasn’t previously able to see. As the Cryo-Electron Microscopy business picks up, this will have a dramatic effect on our Gatan business as we really have pre-eminent technology there.  Deltek this quarter was recognized as cloud-based professional services automation ERP leader by IDC MarketScape. They have sort of as people who know about the class the Magic Quadrant, this is sort of a slightly different thing, but still a very high honor to receive. Sunquest was named the Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory IT Company of the year by Frost & Sullivan, and that really demonstrates our customer intimacy in that space. Strata was named number one by KLAS for Hospital Decision Support Software and that’s a big pay-off for all the enhanced investment that we put in to Strata after we acquired it in the enhanced technology they’re delivering for cost [repayment] in the hospital sector. Aderant Expert has become the number one Enterprise Practice Management System among the Am Law 200 firms. This is really about us improving a channel to market for them and the knowledge that we’re investing for their future, which is a much higher rate of course than what it had when it was inside private equity.  TransCore successfully converted the New York MTA bridges and tunnels. Those of you in New York can give us applause for that. Our ability to execute that was pre-eminent. We delivered everything on time. And really TransCore can be quite proud of what it’s been able to do and will do in the future as infrastructure spending starts to pick up. All of this is sort of a culture of innovation we have in these niche markets. We’ve got dramatically higher RD&E investments in all of our businesses.  Next slide, if we start with our largest sector that’s RF Technology and software, it’s now 42% of the entire company revenue, a little bit more than that on an EBITDA basis. The third quarter represented nearly $0.5 billion of revenue on its own. It was up 61% with organic up 4, and we had a little bit of a pull-in from the fourth quarter at Deltek that strengthened our Q3 results. Deltek’s really had a lot of GovCon wins. We made an acquisition for them in Denmark, meaning non-US cash. A company called WorkBook, which is going to enhance our professional services platform. ConstructConnect also was able to drive considerable growth as their recurring revenue was increasing, and we think there’ll be some Bolt-ons in the ConstructConnect space in the near future.  When you look at the core business without the acquisitions, the operating margins in the quarter were up 280 basis points, and EBITDA I can see also performed very well. We had mid-single digit growth across the other software businesses. Aderant continued to gain share. We made an acquisition, a bolt-on for them that we called Handshake which is in Florida. It adds knowledge management software for the same firm, so it’s a common thing to add and so within our existing distribution channel.  And our freight matching business continues to expand with net subscriber growth. We got great execution from a margin viewpoint in our toll and traffic projects in the quarter which is very encouraging because often times this project have contingencies associated with them and performance dictates how much it really makes at the end of one of the projects.  In the fourth quarter, our software businesses are expected to continue to grow with same strong margins and cash performance that we’ve enjoyed in the third quarter. We see continued momentum for both Deltek and ConstructConnect, they really do have tailwinds behind those businesses.  We expect though we’ll get low-single digit organic growth in the segment in Q4 solely because we had the difficult comp with the MTA startup in the fourth quarter of last year. We see a lot of continuing opportunities for TransCore projects. When we talk to our team there though, they’ve actually added people for the bidding process because there’s so much activity, and they are likely to create even better opportunities in ’18.  We used at the beginning of the year that ’18 could be a challenge because it would be hard to replace the MTA project in New York, but that’s no longer a fear and in fact we think we’re going to grow beyond this year.  Next slide, here we look at medical and scientific imaging. We had a great quarter, but a little bit abnormal around organic growth, you can see it was only up 1%. It really should be mid-single digits, and in fact many of the businesses were mid-single digits and above. Their margins in the quarter were essentially low. We expected so we’re happy with the margins.  We did mid-single digit growth in the medical businesses. If we exclude this one unusual transaction that happened in our Verathon business, which right at the end of the quarter fell short on its revenue projections in the US. And we don’t expect that to continue for long at all.  Revenue growth across all the three medical platforms and they do represent 85% of this segment. And in the products, we had terrific performance out of Northern Digital and IPA and that was offset a bit by what happened in Verathon, so we wind up within that organic one instead of four or five.  In our Acute Care Solutions, we did exceptionally well in the middleware and international arena. A little bit softer in the US, but still net positive organic growth. In the Alternate Site Healthcare business, we continue to have good growth in the Long Term Care GPO and Software businesses there and don’t see really any headwinds for those at all. In the Scientific Imaging business, we had said at the end of quarter two that we would have a light quarter in quarter three from a revenue view point, just because of the issues associated with getting all of the Cryo-EM technology out with the cameras. And in fact that occurred, but that gives us a bolstered opportunity in Q4. If we look at how fourth quarter is going to look, we think that the growth initiatives in our RD&E and channel access for these three medical platforms will continue to be substantial for us. We’re spending about 14 million more this year than the prior year, all in the hopes of capturing forward growth that we’ve talked about earlier today and throughout the year.  Revenue growth should occur in all three platforms, imaging ought to be a little better on timing in shipments. We expect to have better margin improvement sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. And while we may get only two or three points of organic growth in the segment in Q4, we expect to have much better organic growth again in 2018 as we’re back to a normal pace with mid-single digit activity.  Next slide, if we look at Industrial Technology and Energy Systems, the Industrial Technology business was up 12% organically. Neptune had another record quarter, they had double digit growth and earnings. So those people that are complaining about copper, might want to pay attention to what we’re doing. Fluid handling growth from continued share gains is doing really well with Roper Pump in with Cornell.  We improved the upstream oil and gas environment it did and it helped us quite a bit. We think fourth quarter is going to have the same kind of growth characteristics around it as the third quarter did and we expect to get leverage in these businesses above 40%. If you look at energy, organic is up 6%. The reason for that is we have double digit growth in the oil and gas portion which is about two-thirds of our segment, but we had the expected sort of high-single digit decline and we thought we would have in CCC. So the net effect was in to double digit organic growth.  And the third of the business that reports an energy that’s really sensor technology and industrial markets, we were up sort of high mid-single digits there. We see the fourth quarter being similar growth to the third quarter with leverage again above 40%. If you look at the two segments together, they delivered a $107 million of EBITDA and 335 million in sales, 32%. So the business has remained really outstanding.  Next slide, so here we’re getting ready to talk about the guidance profile for Q4. Next slide, so we’re raising our full year guidance raised only by $0.09. We had been 12 to 9.30; we are raising that to 9.27 and 9.33. The full year then will deliver about 22% of revenue growth of which 5% will be organic. We expect to create more than 1.150 billion of operating cash flow.  In the fourth quarter guidance we came in at 256 to 262. Remember we did a little bit better in Q3 that took some of the fourth quarter out in to the third quarter, but on balance we’re raising the full year guidance. I think tax rate in the fourth quarter is likely to be somewhere of what we just in the third quarter or maybe a little bit less, depending on how things go and of course we’re all waiting on what happens with the government, if there actually was a change in business text, Roper would be one of the biggest beneficiaries in the universe.  Next slide, here we look at the summary of our activity for the third quarter. As we said we had a record, third quarter really strength throughout the company. Very few headwinds have developed in 2017, and we really don’t see a many at all for 2018. Revenue as we say is up 24% to 1.171billion. Gross margins is 63% or really pretty spectacular. Deps at 2.36 was considerably above most people expectations. EBITDA at 24% up with 407 million.  Our year-to-date cash flow at 25% of revenue sort of speaks for itself. We already reduced debt by 880 million, and we are rapidly deleveraging which gives us our big reloading the balance sheet much more quickly than I think many people thought.  Our proven CRI principles and discipline really drive our ability to compound cash flow and acquire great businesses, and we’re going to see that activity accelerate in 2018. We think over the next four years we’ll put something above $6 billion to work in acquisitions, which is simply our normal glide path when inside keeping our investment grade rating and just leveraging our free cash flow towards these acquisitions.  Another big takeaway about how the quarter is, we are just started with our 2018 to 2020 planning process and meeting with people, and seeing their initial submissions for ’18. And I have to say that the operating leaders are projecting more confidence for ’18, than any year in the last five that we’ve entered this process. So we look forward to finishing those activities during the fourth quarter and being able to initiate guidance later around a record 2018 contribution.  So with that we will open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go to Scott Davis, Melius Research. 
Scott Davis: I'm gone for a few months, and I come back and look at some pretty darn good numbers, so looks like you're doing your jobs. Anyways, this deferred revenue line item is just amazing. I don’t cover software companies so maybe it’s more common in that world. But the big step up, I assume a large chunk of that is Deltek. And can you just explain to me like, give us an example of kind of the contracts and how it works and that you were able to collect so much cash upfront?
Brian Jellison: Well, it really kind of license and maintenance, many times you get paid a year in advance for that activity. If it’s a SaaS and cloud based, you may get paid a year, you might get paid six months, you might get three months, but you’re always ahead of the curve for prepayment for the technologies that they are using routinely. As they add seats, they’ve got to pay in advance for the seats that they add and so forth. But I want Neil to maybe give you a little more granular explanation about how the contracts work.
Neil Hunn: I would say Scott, we’re very normal and very typical on the software space. So we’re not doing something that’s abnormal in that regard. As Brian mentioned on the recurring revenue streams, which would either be the SaaS piece or the maintenance piece, we will bill those generally a year ahead on the contract cycle. And so you get paid maybe 90 days, you’re booking 270 days of net deferred cash on your balance sheet.  And similarly, when you book on a license sale, often times the payment terms on a license sale, you might get half the payment of license on signing and half when you go liveit. And you’re normally always in a deferred revenue situation during that implementation period. So it’s a very common practice, and we are well within the sort of industry norms, but it’s part of the core business model that’s been created here at Roper over the last decade as we transform business. Well, let me tell you that five years ago on September 30 of ’12, our deferred revenue was 181 million. So part of our acquisition strategy is purposely directed at these kind of opportunities where as you grow it doesn’t draw down your cash. 
Scott Davis: That’s clear. Since Neil you’re on the line, can you just give a little granularity on one-time Verathon weakness that you cited, just a sense of what that is? 
Neil Hunn: Just to stop at the top, as Brian mentioned it was really isolated to Verathon. The rest of the platform performed at or above our expectations. When you double click down into Verathon, it was isolated to the US and to our capital equipment sales to hospitals in the US in the quarter. The consumables piece, recurring piece was quite robust, the international piece was quite robust.  And then when we get into the root cause of what happened in the US, it was a combination of channel execution challenges that are being corrected as we speak, and then a little bit of timing between product cycles, new products we’re developing and the timing of those releases, and we may have frozen our sales force, we may have frozen the market a little bit. But those are starting to release here in Q4 through 2018, so we expect it to be corrected here rather quickly. Won’t say it will be corrected in Q4, might be a little quick, but it will take a couple of quarters to correct it and we should be back on track there.  The future for that business looks like robust given the product roadmap that we have and it is executing well against that. 
Brian Jellison: [Indiscernible] This miss from them on revenue was like $5 million or $6 million. So that’s really – the deal just happens to be different than what we expected.
Operator: We’ll go next to Christopher Glynn, Oppenheimer. 
Christopher Glynn: Just wanted to revisit the RF kind of EBITDA growth algorithm, I think it’s about 70% software now, if you could just mark-to-market the normal price and functionality expansion expectation. 
Brian Jellison: Sure. You’re right, the segment is now majority software, so you have the TransCore [ph] toll and traffic business which is going to be more project driven and is generally going to have lower margin than the software businesses. The software businesses are very steady, they have been mid-single digit growth businesses here for quite a while, and those leverage ratios generally come in at 35% or higher. So I think that’s very sustainable moving forward. So I think you see less variability in this segment than maybe you would have seen 5 or 6 years ago when it was primarily the toll and traffic business. Now it’s really primarily the software business, and of course Deltek and ConstructConnect will both become organic in ’18, which should further boost the organic a little bit, because we said those were resulting mid-single digit growth businesses when we bought them. 
Christopher Glynn: And then RF had very large core margin expansion 280 basis points. Could you just dive into what’s going on there a little, was it just a good mix quarter?
Neil Hunn: Well I think that one of things is that the execution at TransCore continues to improve around their project management. So that’s a favorable variable and then the growth in the software businesses does help obviously because they are higher margin businesses. So both of those are important, and I think some of the RF business are really product businesses, and they’ve performed well in capturing leverage at pretty high levels on incremental revenue.
Brian Jellison: Yeah, that’s right. Some of the smaller businesses we don’t speak a lot about like an RFID is, which we acquired a couple of years ago had excellent growth and excellent leverage. So it really is a mix of number of businesses performing very well within that segment
Operator: And we’ll go next to Deane Dray, RBC Capital Markets. 
David Lu: This is David Lu on for Deane Dray. I want to ask about an update on the M&A pipeline? So you’re sizing over $6 billion of M&A over the next four years. What does the environment look like today, given that multiples are a little bit extended, and what are the sizes of the deals you’re looking at. Thanks. 
Brian Jellison: If our choice was, we’d do $1.5 billion in 2018 that would be good, and our next choice would be 1 billion and one 500 million or next choice would be three $500 million. So what happens now is that we do get some bolt-on opportunities. So already this year we’ve got over 50 million of work on bolt-ons; one for Aderant and one for Deltek. And I would expect you’d see some bolt-on activity in our ConstructConnect business because there’s lot of attractive things which is unique and sort of different for us with those businesses. With those businesses is, they have assimilated small units previously, and so they’re sort of geared up for that activity, whereas we wouldn’t have acquired a small company, but then we just wouldn’t have had the scale to be successful. So we will be able to have a mix of some smaller deals out of that 6 billion plus over the four years. But the lion share of the money will go to large platform expansion opportunities for the company. 
David Lu: And then just one follow-up, as we approach the winter we are anniversaring Deltek’s acquisition. So you mentioned mid-single digit organic growth. What’s this demand environment been like? There hasn’t really been kind of this infrastructure stimulus looking at, but it looks like underlying demand is still very strong. So give us an update on Deltek if you could? Thanks. 
Brian Jellison: Well I think you just did. We really agree with that. It’s mid-single digit growth, maybe a little bit better from time to time. Certainly if you get an infrastructure package ever, that’s only good news for them. Getting a budget passed is good news for them. So that’s a big deal for the customers, Deltek has to know the government got paid budget and that’s already done behind us. So we did see a little pull-in from Q4 in to Q3 at Deltek. Probably not because of that, but you never know.  So we might have a little more better performance in ’18 than we have in ’17 and then we’re going to make substantial contributions from a cash basis and the acquisitions that we just have already announced have lot of synergies inside them and their benefit will tell. 
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie: Can we just go back to this Verathon, I know that you guys did your product refresh at the end of last year. And I’m just trying to get a sense for how much of it was like canal challenges versus having the right products. And then again going back to that comment around, it will take maybe a little bit more in the quarter, a couple of quarters to correct itself. I guess maybe talk a little bit about the confidence you have and it just reversing as we get through 2018. 
Brian Jellison: We have a lot of confidence, and I want to correct you on the product refresh was around our (inaudible) product. Well a lot of new technology has been launched, and that was very successful in growth outside organic growth for the last two years inside Verathon. We have another major project launch around what we call a BladderScan line of products. We also have rate changes that we haven’t announced, but the sales forced is about to enhance some additional products on how they’re used. So if you were satisfied and you already have been briefed on all the product technology occasionally that can get in the way of people making their decision about what they’re buying this quarter.  We also are adding substantial real sales resources, because we think that within the additional new products that are happening, we’re going to get much stronger particularly in the second half of 2018 than we have enjoyed throughout 2017. To capture that we got to have a lot more resources, and it takes time for those people to get trained in those products to get accepted, but we’re actually very excited about Verathon for 2018.  What disappointed us about Verathon third quarter was not so much that they missed by 5 million or 6 million of revenue, but it happened in the last two weeks of the quarter and it wasn’t foreseeing. And so that was the disappointment and we wouldn’t expect it to be our forecast like that. That’s not a rope or trade and that’s one that we know Verathon is embarrassed by and is working rapidly to get that problem solved. 
Joe Ritchie: That’s helpful color Brian. And maybe by follow-up here on ConstructConnect, we’ve had some companies across the space talking about labor constraints across the commercial construction space. First, I’m just curious how that potentially impacts the ConstructConnect business. And then secondly you mentioned bolt-ons earlier around this business. Would that be adding to different verticals, different geographies, I’m trying to get a sense for what Bolt-ons would mean for ConstructConnect?
Brian Jellison: We didn’t say geographic things. I mean there are some regional variances around small niche players. It’s more expanding than number of things. Let’s say they are very strong in certain activities we can plummet. So, the first acquisition we made in this space was On Center and that was all about [drywall]. A lot of what ConstructConnect does is terrific around a wide variety of things and they are very strong in HBAC take-offs from architects, but weak on windows or whatever. So there are certain kinds of businesses that we can add to that, that make the suite larger than it currently is and keep us in a pre-eminent spot. Again those are the kind of things we think of. 
Joe Ritchie: Got it, and on the labor constraint side of the question. 
Brian Jellison: I don’t see any relevancy to that at all. You got to think about where this is, its pre-construction activity, architectural stuff, the amount of labor could only affect them if it became a constraint on being able to put projects in place and that won’t affect the number of users we have or the number of seats that are used in our software. So the software is frequently used in the bidding process for people, so that they have a sense of just how much material has to go in to the project. That’s what you get out of a ConstructConnect analystic and algorithm. So I really don’t think labor would have much of an affect. 
Operator: We’ll go to Richard Eastman, Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman: Brian, could you kind of speak a little bit to the – in Deltek, I think there’s this Handshake, and we also bumped in to Onvia, the two acquisitions and maybe just – they’re probably small, but just curious if you could just speak to those a little bit as tuck-ins or bolt-ons to Deltek?
Brian Jellison: So Onvia is not closed, so we really can’t talk about that. But a tiny (inaudible) company gets a natural fit with Deltek. It’s something that Deltek had paid attention to in the past. It’s something that’s very synergistic to Deltek. The company is really subscaled and hasn’t made much money at all on its own, because it just doesn’t have the channel access. So I think you’ll see our situation around that if we can ever get that deal closed, which we expect would happen in the fourth quarter will help Deltek and Deltek make or be much more effective. On Handshake, let me ask Neil to talk about this, because it’s an exciting bolt-on for Aderant. 
Neil Hunn: So this is a bolt-on product for Aderant, its run from legal firm Knowledge Management. If you look inside, if you’re running a law firm, you basically have to have a practice management system which is core Aderant, you need to have a document management system, and you need to have a knowledge management system. So this is firmly (inaudible) from a knowledge management space. It was sort of the recognized leader in that and we have done just a very large cross-selling opportunities in to our base to take this capability in to. Nice little bolt-on. I would also say it fits all of the Roper acquisition criteria that (inaudible) management team negative to your eye etcetera. 
Richard Eastman: Can I just ask you a quick question about OCS and then also free cash flow being essentially flat year-over-year in the third quarter? Was there anything from the tax payment standpoint or just a little bit curious there?
Brian Jellison: Sure. A little bit higher in terms of tax payment. I think as we look in to Q4 we would expect quite a bit of growth in Q4, as we mentioned 11.50 or greater for the full year means that we’ll have nice growth in the fourth quarter. I think from a working capita standpoint performance was okay in the third quarter. We expect it to be much better in the fourth quarter just around timing of some receivables and so we feel great about the fourth quarter. But I think we are in line with where we said we’d be at this point. 
Operator: We’ll go next to Joseph Giordano, Cowen & Company. 
Joseph Giordano: Can you just explain to me what knowledge management actually is? I feel like that sounds like something we can all use a little or is that not really what that means. 
Neil Hunn: Let’s you call your attorney and you ask if there’s an expert on a particular topic in the firm and that firm has thousand attorneys, how do they answer that question. Well they join a Handshake software, they do a query and look across all the various systems inside that law firm and give you an answer. For instance, (inaudible) about firm knowledge and who has it inside the law firm. 
Joseph Giordano: So want to drill down a little bit on some of the comps that – for things like the imaging business, you know we talk about the backlog in it and the outlook for Cryo-EM looking really strong. I know it’s been a drag for a while down again here. When does that start to like, it’s a longer cycle business I understand that. So when does that start to loosen up for and you start comping up something that looks kind of on the easier side and same with CCC.
Neil Hunn: I think with imaging it will do a little better in the fourth quarter, but it’s really 2018 is when they’ll have easier comps. And remember we keep pruning imaging, and we’re investing a lot in this technology at hand and limit (inaudible). We generally are pruning those businesses to try to have less unique, one-off, camera things or sciences. So it’s wonderful to win the Noble Prize, but generally speaking there is only camera [recorder]. So we’d like to have more application and it’s a business probably it shouldn’t really be reported in that segment. It’s really a precision technology business, more fitting with a storage or something like that.  So we like the business, we particularly what its contributing from a social view point. You can really proud about discovering the Zika virus. But it’s not an overly material business for Roper Technology. What was the other question?
Brian Jellison: CCC that is the business that still doesn’t have a big new construction project going on this space. It’s going to be a little bit later in the rebound before we get revenue from those types of project that really aren’t happening yet. So it is down and not down a lot. We’ll see when we do guidance both for ’18, and we would expect it go down much more to kind of bouncing around in sort of the bottom.  But they’ve done a really nice job executing. Their field service business has been improving. I think the management team has done a great job in a difficult environment. Great margin and I think the business will do well here whenever there is a little bit of an uptick in that part of the market. 
Joseph Giordano: And maybe last from me on Neptune, Brian you talked about Copper. I think I know the answer to this, but like given record quarter here, what’s the order intake kind of been looking like and just your view on the underlying markets there and I guess we’ve had a couple of one-off data points that people got freaked out about. But it seems like, looks like pretty green light there. 
Brian Jellison: I know the Neptune guys will be smiling when they are listening to other peoples’ calls so I can tell you that. There are a lot of people bad-mouthing the activity we don’t see it. It will be a record year for us. It’s a record quarter, we’re up double digits, but the one of the great investment houses has said Copper would be 245 at the end of the year. It’s 315 invested by a mile. But our people, we are absolutely briefly integrated. We have our own foundry, we make lead-free products, we are just incredibly efficient.  So we just aren’t feeling the difficulties that other people are. There’s certainly enough activity for bids. We have the biggest installed base that’s really valuable to haven an installed base, when you are looking at it and we believe we have the best distribution in the US. So that’s helps. And then periodically we get a little bit of international business that could help and we see some of those opportunities that might emerge in 2018. So it’s a very resilient, extremely nimble place. 
Operator: We’ll go next to Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research Partners.
Jeff Sprague: Just a few lose ends maybe for me to clean up. First, can you give us some idea of how big the MTA comp is? Brian you spoke your confidence in kind of getting over that hurdle. But kind of literally talking about there as we look into 2018?
Rob Crisci: On the MTA we still have a strong fourth quarter, but will be against the startup from last year. So if we look at ’18, strictly on MTA it’s probably 15 to 20. Well it could be as much as kind of $20 million headwind. But as Brian mentioned there are a number of projects that we’re bidding, so it’s really too early to tell that we might not be able to replace that or even more. But just on that particular projects, around 20 million. 
Brian Jellison: We’ve gotten our people look at it as, how much do you have to kind of like net new business and software, how much net new business do you need out of TransCore makeup for projects that are rolling off and that number is probably something around $50 million a year of projects. And the opportunity against which we are bidding is substantially larger than that $50 million hurdle for new business each year.  So I think people feel pretty good about that, and I think the organization increasingly gets more affective. I think they’ve gotten substantially better about the administrative side and what do you have to do to bid in those arenas. I think they’ve gotten better racial management. We’ve a relatively new CFO in that business, he’s certainly helping to make a contribution and then Tracy Marks, who runs it is really the domain expert in North America and around the world for these things. So people come to TransCore to brainstorm, and it just gives them a math. And then in some of the other arenas where they’re doing back office work, the number of other people have had big fears that are embarrassing. And so TransCore or TransSuites are for TransCore’s administrative routine around the infinity lane technology we have really give us a substantial advantage to competition here. 
Jeff Sprague: And then just two more quick ones, just based on tax, you’re making some good progress on tax and advance the tax reform. I wonder if you could elaborate on what’s driving that. I just want to clarify Verathon also, I think at the beginning of the call it was characterized as four or five points of growth, which is more like 15 million, not 5 million. Can you just kind of clarify that and (inaudible).
Neil Hunn: I didn’t hear anything like that, maybe when I said it was around $5 million or $6 million or so. It might have been that inside the medical business, maybe somebody is thinking about, we had 1% organic growth that clearly would have been more like 4% organic growth is (inaudible) we have that. Maybe that’s what you heard.
Brian Jellison: The mix versus our external model on medical was high single digits, it was like 8 or so of revenue, versus our model 8 or 9 and 6 of that Verathon and the majority of the rest was around the camera businesses and just kind of noise.
Jeff Sprague: And on tax?
Brian Jellison: Tax, yeah we were north of 29% in the third quarter. That benefited a little bit by favorable resolution from audit activity and we have been working with the tax department on a number of things to try and lower the rate certainly as much as we can prior to hopefully tax reform that went lower in a big way. But we’ve been in a sort of a similar tax range here for the last couple of years. 
Neil Hunn: And I think we expected about 30% and it came it at 29. So it wasn’t really material variance on tax I think. We might be a little bit better in the fourth quarter than we did in the third I hope. But the big benefit would be when you got probably close to two-thirds or 70% of the incomes in the US and you’re paying 35% plus that goes to 20, and you can kind of do the math on that, and that a huge deal for us. 
Operator: We’ll go to Alex Blanton, Clear Harbor Asset Management.
Alex Blanton: I just wanted to trick something that you said, you missed the revenue from Verathon probably 5 million to 6 million in the last two weeks. So does that come up to about $0.02 a share?
Brian Jellison: I don’t. Didn’t help.
Alex Blanton: It would be dependent on the incremental.
Brian Jellison: If we had 6 million and it is incrementally 40% and it would be 2.4 and take a third of it away for tax, it would be 1.5 million. So it might round to $0.02, but it’s probably more likely a penny and a half.
Alex Blanton: And the problem there was that you introduced some new products. So the customers decided to wait and buy the new product instead of the existing one. Is that what happened?
Brian Jellison: I think it was more about our sales force than our customers. If you’re having a good year and you’ve been having a good year for a while and you know you got a lot of new stuff that’s coming in to the bag, sometimes you can get behavior there that’s not perfect. So the products are generally speaking the best in the industry, I think they’re going to be even better. So how of it is that? I don’t know. I think it’s also that we were adding quite a few sales people.  So I think there are just some noise that (inaudible) as you’re changing territories and moving things around, that’s frictional. But in a quarter where we did a $1.171 billion and delivered 407 million of EBITDA, there’s too much focus and worry about the $5 million of revenue variance in one business out of 50. 
Alex Blanton: And one final question and that is about the perspective deduction in corporate tax rate. My feeling is that for most companies a lot of that benefit will eventually be competed away because every industry has sort of a normal rate of return, and if you suddenly get a big increase in the rate of return because of the tax cut, tax reduction than it opens a door for competition to compete that benefit away back to the normal rate of return. I mean think about each industry, why is the return where it is? Because that’s a normal return.  But in your case since you dominate so many industries and have so little competition in many cases. It would seem to me that that effect would be less that you would keep perhaps more of the potential corporate tax reduction than the average. Would you agree with that?
Neil Hunn: Yes.
Operator: That concludes the Roper Technologies question and answer session. We will now return to Zack Moxcey for closing remarks. 
Zack Moxcey: Thank you everyone for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with your during our next earnings call. 
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Roper Technologies Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I'll turn the conference over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Zack, please go ahead.
Zack Moxcey - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Debbie, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the second quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Neil Hunn, Executive Vice President; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We've prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast, and are also available on our website. Now, if you'll please turn to slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we'll make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, and also further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now, please turn to slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is on our press release and also included as a part of this presentation on our website. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items on a pre-tax basis: a $16 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquired deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions, and $1 million of related commission expense. This represents revenue and commissions that those companies would have recognized if not for our acquisition; a $73 million adjustment for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; and lastly a $9 million gain on the sale of an Energy product line, less a $2 million charge on a minority investment. And now, if you please turn to slide 4, I will turn the call over to Brian. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Hey. Thank you, Zack, and good morning, everybody. Here on slide 4, we're detailing the agenda, which will be to start by going through the second quarter financial results, and then look at the segment detail for each of our four reporting segments, and then look at the Q3 and, more importantly, full-year guidance for the company, and take your questions. So, next slide here on 5, we had a record quarter. It's actually an all-time record-setting quarter in our history, in virtually everything you could measure, certainly including revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow. The asset-light businesses that are really protected by these niches had tremendous execution this quarter, great focus. We've extended our quarterly review process as Zack and Shannon and Rob would be able to drive that and hear what everybody is thinking about for the balance of the year, and it was sort of remarkable how consistent everybody was with really only one business, sort of, down throughout the balance of the year. We'll talk about that later. Everybody else fundamentally at mid-single digit growth and above. Our revenue was up 23% in the quarter to $1.151 billion. We had 6% organic growth. And a great thing is, it really was across all four of the segments. This isn't just related to some bounce in the oil and gas business effect, that really wasn't relevant. The acquisitions, Deltek and ConstructConnect, continue to perform in an exceptional clip. You'll be able to see that when we get into the RF & Software segment. Gross margins were spectacular. They were up 170 basis points to 62.7%. So, I know a lot of other multi-industry types have had cost creep issues, and people worrying about disintermediation and being Amazoned, and you can see that none of those are risks here at Roper. Our earnings or DEPS were $2.24. Our EBITDA was up 26% to $394 million, sort of $1.6 billion run rate. EBITDA margin was up 70 basis points to 34.3%. And our operating cash flow for the first half of the year was up 33% from last year to $550 million. That allowed us to reduce our debt in the first half of the year alone by $570 million. And so, after those record results for Q2, we'll turn now to the income statement, next slide. The income statement, as you can see, revenue, gross profit, EBITDA, interest expense was up from $27 million to $46 million, but easily covered by economic performance. Just a word on the tax rate. What we do is, we take the adjustments, and we assume a 35% tax rate on those adjustments, and you apply the GAAP tax rate, which was 29.7%. And the two together form our tax rate, which is 31% for the second quarter. And we're going to suggest that probably the tax for the second half of the year would be around 30%, a little bit higher in third quarter than in the fourth quarter, which should be a little lower. Net earnings, you can see, we're up 22% to $232 million. Next slide. On slide 7, we'll look at the continuing ability of us to compound our cash flow. Here you see operating cash flow last year through the first half was $414 million. This year, it's $550 million. And I look back five years ago, at the end of June 30 of 2012, our operating cash flow was $261 million, now it's $550 million. Our year-to-date free cash flow represents 23% of revenue, which I think is pretty well a standalone kind of activity from us. And our deleveraging in the first half was terrific. We're down below 3.5 times our debt-to-EBITDA credit facility measurement, and we expect to continue to pay that down throughout the balance of the year. And when we say cash is the best measure of performance, all you have to do is look at these numbers, and see why we're so steadfast in our belief about that. Next slide, if we go to slide 8 here, our asset-light business model. In the first quarter of this year, we actually got to a negative working capital number. And here you'll see we're down to 2.4% negative, and the components are really interesting. If I look at inventory at 4.4% of revenue, five years ago, that number was 7.5%. So terrific results in terms of asset velocity there. Receivables are at 15.9%. Five years ago, they were 17.7%. Our payables are 11.3%, and five years ago, they were 11.5%. Deferred revenue is massively different, 11.4%. It's absolutely astounding number. When you think about the ratios, that deferred revenue at 11.4% is greater and exceeds the payables and accruals number of 11.3%. And that's what drives us down to a negative number at 2.4%. Five years ago, that number was 9.9%. So you got 1,200 basis points improvement in our balance sheet during that timeframe. Five years ago, we had $100 million of deferred revenue. And at the end of this quarter, we had $516 million of deferred revenue. So as we grow, we actually have cash provided to us rather than having to use cash to grow, which is an enormous strategic advantage. Next slide, 9, on our segment detail, we'll go through each of the four – most importantly, I think the gross margins above 50% for all four of our segments, and that's something that everybody running those segments is very proud of. Next slide, 10. We look at the largest segment, now, is the Radio Frequency Technology & Software arena. Here, our revenue was up 64%. Organic growth was up 6%, and FX cost us a point. Deltek was really led by their GovCon business that we discussed in the first quarter. And they were successfully able to launch a new software suite that really targets professional services and consulting firms. And that's off to a good start. Our ConstructConnect business, which has just extreme high-90s recurring revenue, was up high-single digits in their recurring revenue alone in the quarter. And they continue to have expanded opportunities with On Center, as we can cross-sell and do a variety of things there. Most importantly with ConstructConnect, they finally can now, kind of, focus on long-term forward growth. They certainly had to think about their private equity exit all of last year, and the assimilation of some small bolt-on acquisitions. So I think this is the first time they've been able to really behave in a way that creates the long-term behavior that we expect from our businesses. We wound up having our Annual Meeting this year in June in Cincinnati at the headquarters of ConstructConnect, and had our board meeting there, so that they could get an in-depth look at the ConstructConnect team. And we also brought some of the Deltek leadership in to talk about the opportunities we have with the two, and discussed some of the bolt-on acquisitions that we'll be making for these two businesses that they were analyzing prior to our acquisition, and we continue to work with them to see about which ones we might execute and when that would happen. Aderant continued to gain share in the quarter. We're very pleased to see their results. They've had a number of significant wins in large law firms, and so the growth rate there is up to double digits, now. And our toll and traffic project business was markedly better from a margin viewpoint. You might remember, in the first quarter, because tag sales were abnormally low for a variety of reasons, the Saudi project with TransSuite software doesn't really use tags, and the MTA tunnel project is mostly readers and other kind of activity. So, the tag shipments sort of came back to normal here on a relative basis in the second quarter and drove margins. In fact, the leverage in RF, sequentially, is nothing short of spectacular. In the second half of the year, we expect to continue to have sort of mid-single digit growth with continuously good margins and cash performance out of all the software businesses. The tunnel project is going to come full circle in the fourth quarter, where it will still be at a decent rate, but it will have been – the comp really from the prior year would be in that base, so you won't see much incremental improvement in that project in Q4. And we hope to have it completed here by the end of this year. Our tag shipments, though, in tolling should continue to improve sequentially. We're seeing a lot of bid activity, and a lot of people trying to get in front of the infrastructure interest that they hope to capture in 2018, but none of us are going to count that until we see something out of the government. We do expect continued momentum at Deltek and ConstructConnect. And then, Deltek, you should know, is seasonally strong in the fourth quarter, so that'll help our results there. And for the entire segment as a whole, we think we should expect mid-single digit organic growth. So, I'll turn to the next segment on slide 11, Medical & Scientific Imaging. Here, we had, for Medical, organic growth of 5%. Imaging was down low-single digits in the quarter, so the net effect was organic growth for the segment of 4%. FX was a point. The medical products business grew primarily driven by Northern Digital and IPA. The acute software business, which includes our decision support SaaS business for hospitals and diagnostic connectivity, grew and was also helped by some international business that we're growing now. The alternate site healthcare business was fine. MHA performed very well in the quarter, and both SoftWriters and SHP, which are derivatives of that business, did well. The Imaging business, while it declined just modestly on a revenue basis, right at the end of the quarter had considerable order placements and requests for some new camera technology that we've been launching that will go into this cryo-EM space, and it's going to drive an unusual second half of the year where we'll be relatively soft. And the Gatan business in the third quarter, as they're gearing up for this, sort of, changeover to the new camera technology, and then that'll result in an extremely strong fourth quarter for them. So, for the rest of the second half, we still think we'll have sustained kind of mid-single digit growth out of Medical. All three platforms, we think, sort of, will perform similarly in that category. We continue to increase our investment in R&D and channel development for all of those businesses. In fact, in the second quarter of this year, our investment in R&D and channel was up about 18% year-over-year, and yet you can still see margin improvement. Those focuses are really around genetics workflow, some things at NDI that we can't talk about much from a proprietary viewpoint. They're really non-medical electromagnetic applications for virtual reality and augmented reality. We talked about how Imaging will go. And then, mid-single digit organic growth for the entire segment. The next segment, here on slide 12, let's start with Industrial. And then you can see Industrial grew 9% organically with a point of FX. Neptune really had a spectacular quarter. It was a record in every category. And Struers did extremely well. Our fluid handling businesses were fine, and then Roper, which is inside the Industrial segment, did have a bounce-back from abnormally low numbers in the past, but not overly material for the segment, but certainly good news for Roper. On the second half of the year, we think we'll get mid-to-high single digit growth, and we do expect to have a record year for Neptune's water meter business. We've got terrific leverage on the growth, as you can see in the segment, and the same with Energy. So, if we shift to the Energy segment, organic revenue was up 7% here with two points of FX. About 35% of the Energy segment is Industrial. And we made two smaller transactions in here, so we sort of fine-tuned what we're doing. We sold our SETPOINT business, which was a portion of Compressor Controls to (16:06) in the quarter, and that was a little over $10 million. And then, we acquired a Canadian company using Canadian cash to acquire Phase Tech, which is a precision instrument company, that will be managed inside our PAC business. So net, we had a modest outlay of cash to achieve those things. And they'll kind of wash themselves out in revenue, but it will give us some positive EBITDA for 2018. The Industrial businesses, as a whole, grew sort of high-single digits, which were led really by Dynisco's polymer instruments and rubber instruments. You're probably seeing all of the tire companies investing heavily for new technology. Oil and gas had modest growth on improvement in the upstream, but that was largely offset by the continued expected decline at Compressor Controls. So not of a lot of bounce. I mean, those businesses were down dramatically in 2015 and 2016, and they're going to be up a little bit this year. The important thing to think about, the little of portion of Energy that's inside Industrial and then the two-thirds that are sort of inside Energy is that, in 2014, they've represented about 17.5% of the company's revenue. Today, they represent about 8.5% of the company's revenue. So, even a variance in those of any direction will no longer have the effect that it once did for the enterprise. Next slide. If we look at slide 13, the guidance update and – that's on 14, sorry. So, as we look at the guidance, we're going to raise all three categories of our guidance. We're raising the adjusted DEPS to $9.12 up to $9.30. It previously had been $8.98 to $9.28. We actually started the year at $8.82 to $9.22. Revenue, we started the year at 3% to 5% organic. And at the end of the first quarter, we said, well, maybe 4% to 5%. Now, we're going to say it'll be above 5% for the year. And total revenue, we started out the year saying maybe 20% to 22%. And then, we went up to 21% to 22%. Now, we're saying revenue will be above 22% for the year. Our operating cash flow is now going to exceed $1.150 billion for the year. And tax, I think I commented on before, we think that tax rate for the balance of the year will probably be in the 30% arena; higher in the third quarter, lower in the fourth quarter. And then, third quarter DEBS is at $2.24 to $2.30, primarily because of the shifting technology in Imaging with cameras which is going to pull stuff into the fourth quarter and out at the third quarter as people would prefer the new products. I think that's about all there is to say on guidance, all good news. We shift into the summary on the business. You can see that we did have these record results in all of the important categories. Cash return on investment continues to improve at Roper. Most of the multi-industry people are around 20% to 40%. We're going to be over 200% this year. Our cash earnings will be higher. And our networking capital and physical plant, equipment and cumulated depreciation taken together will be lower as a function of sales, and that's what produces the higher cash return. Half of our EBITDA this year, probably a little more than that will come from software and network businesses. We're going to enjoy, as we have in the second quarter, we think, broad-based organic growth throughout the year. The gross margins, which really demonstrate for those of you that are worried about people being disintermediated, which is one of the things that we've spent a great deal of time on over the last five years as we've reinvented the company to assure we didn't buy assets that had that risk, clearly isn't happening when you have 170 point increase in your gross margins. Year-to-date operating cash flow, as I said before, up a third to $550 million. Should be even better in the second half of the year. The existing acquisitions, Deltek and ConstructConnect, sort of outperformed the enterprise anyway. They're just truly exceptional. And our negative working capital gives us an ability to compound cash, as we grow at a faster clip than we have in the past, which was still best in class. And then, by rapidly deleveraging here, taking $570 million out in the first half, with considerable cash still to come yet this year, it sort of demonstrates the reinvention strategy that we had with the kind of deals we've made in 2015 and 2016, and then the fruit of those gets delivered here in 2017. A very disciplined capital deployment process is still alive and well, and you can expect substantial capital deployment in 2018 and beyond, and there may still be some yet this year. It should be a breakout year for Roper, and a year everybody can feel really good about. And lastly, before the Q, I just want to sort of compliment Rob Crisci and Jason Conley and Shannon O'Callaghan, and Zack, and our operating EVPs, Paul Soni and Neil Hunn, in this transition that occurred in the second quarter. It's very seamless. If anything, we've been a little bit more efficient in getting prepared for the call, and I think you'll find everybody is up to speed and knowledgeable about everything that's going on. And it's a nice transition to be able to achieve all that, mostly with internal people. So, with that, I think we'll open it up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our first question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Good morning, Chris (22:33).
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Good to see the transition, a lot of nice new exciting faces there. Hey, the RF margins, look, they've ramped a little faster from the first Q to the second than I expected. I know the new deals have some more back-half-weighted seasonality. Just wondering if that margin ramp was a little steeper than you expected within the first half.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: No. Really, the big story there is the Amtech tag business. And in the first quarter, it was extremely low compared to any kind of normalcy, and the margins associated without the operating profit are substantially higher than the service business. Now, Deltek and ConstructConnect certainly helped us well, but it's really the getting rid of the boat anchor that we had in the first quarter that made the difference as large as it is. Now, that said, sequentially, I think they did produce about $25 million OP on – $26 million of revenues, so we probably won't have that same leverage every quarter, but leverage is going to be terrific around here at 40% or so.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, within diagnostics, just wondering if you could update the broader complexion for genomics and molecular. How that adoption and progression is taking shape there?
Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Hey. It's Neil Hunn. Good morning to you.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hey, Neil.
Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.: So, we continue to invest behind the molecular genetic opportunity. It's a new laboratory being set up in virtually every hospital across the world. The adoption – the number of tests going into practice, it's a slow build, right? So we have to be there to automate the workflows. And we're there today, but we expect this to be a longer-term, multiyear build. And so it's still relatively immaterial in our results today. We'd expect that candidly for the next year or so, maybe two, and then slowly build into a nice, recurring, highly profitable business for us.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey. I love to give a shout out to the two rookies on the call, if I could. Zack and Shannon, welcome, and best of luck. And, hey, Brian, just maybe we could start off with forward-looking thoughts on the pipeline of SaaS businesses that you're looking at. What the competition is against private equity, staple financing? And then, you did call out as bolt-ons with ConstructConnect and Deltek, and how realistic in near term might those be?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: So, sort of a bifurcated answer there on the regular deal flow – deal flow for the world is down about 20% the first half of this year over last year, just in terms of M&A activity. Private equities is very aggressive, probably more so than they have been. There people continue to pour money into private equity, so the more money they get, the less discipline they have to be. Their internal rate of returns continue to get reduced, which doesn't get a lot of conversation; and high-yield debt still assumes there's no risk in the world, and so it's really, really cheap. All those things lead to very high-priced multiples. We haven't seen much in the way of a fall off of activity. There've been a couple of things we've talked to people about that probably coming in at maybe two turns of price to EBITDA lower than people were suggesting they would be. Fortunately, we still are seeing a lot of activity that would be attractive for us. We're just being cautious sort of throughout the year to get the balance sheet where we wanted. So I think supply and demand is okay. On these bolt-ons, when we were working in the fourth quarter of last year, we did a lot of work around market development for, particularly, Deltek and, certainly, to some extent for ConstructConnect. So we kind of went through about a dozen different small potential niche bolt-ons for people, and told them we would take a hard look at those beginning in the second half, depending on how the first half went. And certainly, the integration of those businesses, the governance model which has sort of been adopted and in place, and then the in-depth review we had at our board meeting in June has given us confidence to go ahead and execute a couple of these bolt-ons. Whether they'll happen between now and the end of the year or in the first part of next year, sort of hard to predict. There are conversations that were ongoing before we acquired the businesses, and they'll kind of continue to be held; but, there is a possibility we might agree to one or two or three of these, but they wouldn't be large.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And then, a question for Rob. So look, I see operating cash flow for the year is up 33%, but the free cash flow conversion this quarter was a touch light versus your historical second quarters. Was there anything unusual, any timing of payments?
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: I wouldn't say unusual. I'd say it's true we had two tax payments in the second quarter, right, and no tax payments in the first quarter. So given the fact that we have increasing earnings this year, then we have a little bit higher tax payments. We also had the new bonds that we did last year. That payment hits in the second quarter, so that's another incremental $10 million that happened sort of – $20 million of cash, but sort of think of it as $10 million that would have been in Q1, but actually hits in Q2. I think on a full-year basis, if you look at our current guidance, we're at about 120%-plus operating cash conversion. I think that's important to note. People like to call the sort of new earnings convention cash EPS, and the reality is it's adjusted EPS and our cash number is always going to be quite a bit higher. So we'll do 120% operating cash conversion on the adjusted EPS number on a full-year basis. So I'd say we're right on track, if not above, where we thought we'd be three months ago.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good to hear. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Robert McCarthy with Stifel.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I guess the first question I would have is – and I only get two – is with respect to the book-to-bill you saw in the quarter, how would you comment? Would you say it's strong, weak versus your own expectations? How do you expect to kind of channel the fill through the back half of the year in terms of the order environment?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: I'd say it was strong. We're really trying to avoid talking a lot about, first, because it is so unimportant when you get to all these software businesses. It's not like these book-and-ship business, where they go, but certainly orders were strong in all four segments; book-to-bill was fine. It was over, I think, 1.02 or something.
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Yes. 1.02 for the company; book-to-bill at Industrial, 1.05. That's a really good number. We had – we talked about the record year at Neptune. They had a record orders quarter as well. So I think in individual businesses, for us it's very helpful, to Brian's point, overall as a company, as we've moved so much towards software, it's becoming less and less important metric for us sort of at the enterprise level.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then, I guess, taking the vein (30:31) of that question to the working capital, obviously, continued impressive in terms of this transformation to more of an asset-light business model, but help us in terms of what businesses will lead the way in terms of continuing to improve that versus what businesses may be lodestones to there? Maybe talk about the product software mix.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: So, if you think about half the EBITDA coming from the software and network businesses, generally, all of those – or none of those would really have a positive working capital number. They'd all be modestly negative, some more so than others. Those businesses have extremely high recurring revenue, so the recurring revenue portion doesn't drive a lot more new deferred revenue. It's only the net new businesses they get that drives the deferred revenue. Then, you have the sort of other half of the enterprise that is the product businesses, and those have had – they probably have 90% of the asset velocity improvement that they're going to get over the last, really, 10 years, and in particularly five. You might remember, when I started I said I want to have payables offset the total cost of inventory. And then, all you're doing is managing receivables. And receivables are a different subject, because you get pricing and terms and various things that have to do with growth around receivables. And so, those businesses don't get the benefit of the deferred revenue, but they do get the asset velocity. They continue to get rewarded, sort of, qualitatively for improving the asset velocity. It's such a big part of the culture. I'm sure like somebody like Shannon, who is inside now from outside, probably is surprised at how much time is spent on that in these quarterly audit reviews and how focused our people on the subject. So we'll get continued growth in that. We have sort of forecast about how deferred revenue grows, and that'll help us. The other categories, inventory at 4.4% (32:55) and then receivables at 15.9% are probably about as good as you get. And then, payables at 11.5% (sic) [11.3%] is pretty decent. You get less inventory, it's harder to have extended payables.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Best wishes to the new gang.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: (33:11). One more question here is fine. Okay.
Operator: We'll take our next question, then, from Steve Tusi (sic) [Steve Tusa] with JPMorgan.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Hey. Good morning.
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Hey, Steve.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Congrats again to the new guys, even though Shannon is not quite a new guy. But congrats on the new position there.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: (33:39)
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: On Sunquest, can you just talk about how the roll-out of, kind of, the new products is coming along there? And just a little bit of color on the organic growth there? And then how you expect that to trend, kind of – any visibility you have on kind of that picking up in 2018?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Well, we can do that. I think all of the Acute Care businesses are really doing reasonably well. Sunquest in North America has been slower than it has been outside the U.S. I think hospital consolidation, which generally helped the Sunquest brand, the lab portions, (34:16) has been – while there's still been consolidation, they haven't decided to do anything. So that's been slower than normal. But even with that, we're going to have positive growth for Sunquest throughout all of next year. And again, I'd just caution everybody, you've got to look at our diagnostic connectivity business, and GeneInsight and UNIConnect and CliniSys is all part of the Acute Care thing. And in total, they're going to be growing this mid-single digit rate. But Neil maybe want to talk specifically about how we're moving ahead with UNIConnect and GeneInsight and Sunquest's whole brand of activity, because it's really incorporating all of those.
Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.: It is, and we talked a little bit about it before on the molecular genetics tracks. I don't want to repeat that, but we also see good activity and momentum internationally, and then also in our community and connectivity parts of the businesses. So, as Brian said, it's been a sort of as expected for this quarter, and sort of mid-single digit grower for us for the balance of the year and into next year.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And any update on growth – anything in Medical? Like, you have the med device businesses that moves around next year that either slows or accelerates? Or is this kind of the – you're kind of at a good solid trend line right now, given some of the puts and takes. Maybe MHA, drug introductions, anything like that that's currently visible that will kind of swing that number around at all?
Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.: So if we take the – let's take the three parts. We just talked about the acute care software on the Alternate Site, MHA software, et cetera. That's a very sort of predictable recurring revenue business. We did lap all the one-timers last year. We don't expect them or see them recurring into next year. We'd expect sort of continued mid-single digit growth in that part of the business. On the product side of the business, it's been, again, a solid mid-single digit grower for us. There's puts and takes, and the growth drivers will be a little bit different next year than this year, but we'd expect it to continue into next year. Mind you, we haven't done our business reviews into next year, and we'll sort of reserve the right to tweak and tune these, but at a high level, that's what we look at. One thing that might be worth commenting on, Brian touched on in the slide, is the investments that we made in R&D and channels across the platform. They're quite broad. They're obviously the ones in diagnostics international and acute care. We made a number of channel investments in Strata. There're some new categories for our SHP businesses there and again to continue the R&D investments in Northern Digital and Verathon to drive product vitality. In this year, incrementally, that R&D is up $15 million to $20 million across the platform. And so we're doing that to sustain or possibly increase that long-term, mid-single digit growth rate.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: How far above the corporate average is Medical R&D at the stage of the game for the segment?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: So as a percent of revenue for the segment, it's high-single digits as a percent of revenue. That's just R&D. If we include engineering, it's double-digits.
Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Oh, yeah, it'd be double digits.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. I appreciate it. A good quarter.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys, and welcome to everybody on board as well.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Good morning, Joe. Thanks.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So, my first question, it looks like things are just really kind of humming along, especially with the recent acquisitions that you guys have made. And I guess, if you kind of think through those acquisitions really being SaaS-based in industries that historically haven't had a lot of tech, so whether it's legal, construction, government, how are you guys thinking about potential consolidation within those spaces versus adjacencies for other SaaS-based type acquisitions?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: So, we look at those categories, right? So, the one advantage is when you have a network or sort of platform we have with Deltek and ConstructConnect, or MHA, you can make a small niche acquisition that doesn't have very much profitability, eliminate its cost structure, maintain the investment, get better channel access, and have it be a good deal. So you might find us doing bolt-ons that we would never do as a standalone, whereas, in the old product business, as you would have – perhaps we've done a standalone business here. So I think that profile could change a little bit. We've never really been tied down to a particular expansion in a category, right? I think where a lot of the M&A breaks down in the world is people who try to buy their distribution, or try to buy their competitor, and they're frankly driven by their product line nature of what it is they do, and they don't look outside the box for things that are attractive. We've looked at assets in the insurance industry, we've looked at assets in fintech, there's a lot of things that we've looked at, and we continue. We just want to do the best transaction possible. The wonderful thing about cash return as a metric is, instead of looking at an EVA approach, where as long as it's greater than the cost of capital, you could sub-optimize and do it, we're looking at things that are accretive to the cash-return profile, and it gets us a lot more discipline. The thing I think you'd see we wouldn't do is we're not interested in looking at an SAP or an Oracle type of small platform that applies ubiquitously across a broad series of categories. Basically, we want our software businesses to be providing a solution for a specific type of activity, usually a singular vertical.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. That makes a lot of sense, Brian, and I do appreciate the color. I guess maybe going back to prior question and, Rob, just focusing on the cash this quarter was better than we expected as well, how are you guys thinking about the debt paydown for the rest of the year, specifically? And what kind of gross leverage are you guys targeting by the end of the year?
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: So, we certainly have the ability to pay down quite a bit more debt the rest of the year. If you just look at our cash flow guidance, it's probably giving us roughly $400 million of additional cash that we can use to pay down debt. Now, listen, there's also some acquisition opportunities out there that we certainly could look at doing as well. So I think we came into the year saying we would de-lever by sort of $700 million or more, and we're at $570 million, and we're certainly going to still look to lower that number more throughout the rest of the second half of the year.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That makes sense. All right. Thanks, guys.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: We're also focused on increasing our EBITDA.
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: That's correct.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: So, there's two sides to that formula.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Joe Giordano with Cowen & Company.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Hey. Good morning.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: So, I mean, without tipping your hand, are you talking about Neptune having a great year? You've seen a lot of activity in that market with companies coming to market. How do you view that as – I know Neptune, a good business on its own right, but a little bit different than what you've been evolving towards. So how do you kind of view that business? How it's doing versus what you're seeing in the market? And appetite for those kind of businesses right now?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Well, Neptune has been probably the most important acquisition in our history, right? I mean it transformed the company totally. We made the biggest bet that we've ever made on that. We deployed four times the entire EBITDA of the enterprise. We issued equity, we did convertible debt, so we bet the company on Neptune in December of 2003. And it's performed far in excess of what anyone ever believed it would, other than us. We still think they're the – well, they are the market leader, certainly. We're investing considerable money into software development and a variety of technologies. I don't think people have a clue about what we're doing in those spaces. So we remain very committed to Neptune. We appreciate what it's done for this company, and we think it's got a great long-term future. We're not interested in water assets, generally, outside the U.S. Neptune has sort of a different capability in North America. The water meters that you look at in Europe are small and are apartment based. So there is some opportunity for commercial, but we're going to do well on a variety of areas. And some of our newer technologies will have a little bit more global reach than the current technology has. So we're pretty comfortable with it. It's certainly, in our view, the highest valued asset globally, and you wouldn't see us make another acquisition in that arena because nobody performs at our level.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Fair enough. Do you guys care to comment on how Deltek and ConstructConnect are doing margin-wise versus the overall segment average?
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, from an EBITDA margin, they're right in the sort of mid-30s, right where we said they'd be, kind of, starting out the year. I mean, they're right on track. They're performing very well. If anything, Deltek over-performed a little bit in Q2 versus what we thought they would do in Q3, as they were able to capitalize on some of the GovCon wins a little bit sooner than we expected; but, from a margin perspective, right on line with what we expected.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, maybe lastly, is there any, like, big lumpiness we have to think about with TransCore with some of your big projects? And at this point, you talked about New York wrapping up, you have Saudi, and then – was it Houston (44:38) big one going on now? Is there anything we just need to think of cadence-wise?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. That's not abnormal. Those kind of things happen all the time. The Saudi situation will wind down in 2018, but still will be there, while we'll actually just truncate at the end of the year with the MTA tunnel project in New York. But we're certainly having conversations with people about a variety of other things. I think the last sort of look at kind of a bid situation, we have more bids out, I think, than any time in our history. So it's impossible to predict when they'll happen. I think a lot of people are confused about what the infrastructure situation will be with the government. And those people that feel really bullish about that are at work aggressively and we would benefit from those projects. Whether they ever come to fruition is beyond our ability to interpret.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you, guys.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Good morning. Just a couple from me. Just at a very high level, is there anything in the ObamaCare meltdown political disarray that kind of ripples through your businesses or showing any signs of change in customer behavior in the near term?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: I don't think so. Our businesses are really all centered around things that aren't volume variant, so the number of patients treated, things like that, are not very important in the process. It might be slowing down in this hospital consolidation in North America; maybe decisions around that are a little slower. I don't know, Neil, if you want to add anything to that?
Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Just briefly, it didn't – when the legislation was passed a number of years ago, it wasn't really a tailwind then. So to the extent it gets restructured or wound down or whatever happens, that we don't expect it, as Brian said, to have a meaningful impact. I do think that hospitals wanting to know the environment in which they're operating in will help their decision cycles, but other than that, no impact for us.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: I think at the very beginning, you had this meaningful use initiative, and so that did drive up the Sunquest lab piece; but, we knew that. We planned for that and kind of worked around it. That's why we've turned it really into the acute care hospital family of activity. And so, we feel pretty good about that.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Also, just thinking about your gross margins, particularly in the software-oriented businesses, particularly, you're still relatively new in this transformation as a company and the headline gross margins look fantastic. But do you think about what your entitlement gross margin is there, where these businesses should be over time? I would think you don't believe they're over-earning. So to – correct me if I'm wrong, but to what degree do you see margin upside in those businesses?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Well, I think you want to be careful. The gross margins are really pretty good. Medical gross margins are 72%, (48:05) right, but then you have a higher rate of R&D, and channel investment in Medical, and you got a higher SG&A. Everything is getting sold direct, nothing goes through distribution. So the net yield is really quite high, but you don't manage those businesses like you do a product business. We're squeezing everything out. If you look at Industrial, there those gross margins are like 51%, but the SG&A is extremely low and you got a little bit of R&D and manufacturing overhead. So they're just different kind of businesses. I think we have learned how to manage all of the things in the portfolio really quite well, and that's why you see 170 basis points improvement in our gross margins (48:57).
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, a number of our software businesses have R&D well into the double-digits as a percent of revenue. I mean, a company like Deltek is in the teens. So it's really about R&D investment, which you would – certainly you can do given the high gross margin, and still generate EBITDA margin in the 30%, 40% plus range. It's very standard for those businesses.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: And then, just lastly for me. Good answer previously on Neptune, but what do you see moving into 2018 from a project opportunity or otherwise that would give you some indication on how to think about growth next year?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: For the enterprise as a whole, we haven't really done a lot of that, but when we go through our quarterly review governance process, we kind of talk about what people see and I think most people have, just as basically, they see the second half of this year as quite similar to the first half of this year. I don't think they see a trend that's really different going into 2018 than 2017.
Robert Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: And Neptune in particular, there aren't large projects, right? We have the big – you might recall the big Toronto project a few years ago. It's a bunch of small projects in general, just growth in the market. They gained share over the past couple of years, and they're holding that share and they're just growing a little bit ahead of the market. So that's very standard for Neptune.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: We'll go next to Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes. Good morning. Just a quick follow-up there really on the Industrial Tech business and Neptune. When I look at the order growth, kind of mid-teens order growth, was that pretty dispersed across the three pieces of the business there, Neptune Materials and Analysis and Industrial Pump business? Because you had raised – it appears that you raised maybe the second half growth guide, core growth guide for IT to mid-to-high single digits. Just – what weighted towards the high-single digit here at this point?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Yes. I think, well, as you know, Neptune is about half of the segment. And Neptune had record orders and good backlog for second half delivery. So that's really the big difference. We have a small piece in that segment that's upstream oil and gas, which has been strong but a very, very small number, and there's really no change to our outlook on those businesses, Roper Pump in particular. It's really – I would think Neptune would be the reason for the slight upgrade in organic for the segment.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I see. And then, also just a question, Brian, when you look at the acquisitions here over the last few years and your movement to the application software area, the medical area, could you just kind of maybe speak to the international growth opportunities in those newer businesses? And does it kind of accelerate your opportunity to grow internationally, given the software penetration that you've had?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Each one is different, so you can't really make a sort of blanket statement. So ConstructConnect is more around a North American strategy, that is a very global business. It's serving professional services, it doesn't matter where they are, whether they're in Europe or they're in Australasia or – quite large business reach for that business. The CBORD business is really for the most part a North American business with a little bit of activity in the Middle East and English-speaking territories. I would say it's not – it's not radically different than the rest of the businesses. There are just a couple of the software businesses that really aren't focused on international opportunities.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Just in the quarter, the second quarter, international, how do the geographies look relative to the core growth rate, total?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: So, for a company overall, U.S. led the growth. U.S. was mid-single, then sort of rest of the world was more sort of up a little flash.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. God morning, folks. Just two quick questions. First in the software business, can you comment on how sub adds, renewals, retention worked out? And then, as a side to that, on Aderant, congrats on the big wins. Is it big enough to set up a tough comp next year, or not?
Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.: So, this is Neil. On the software, you really have to go company by company on the adds and the retention rates. There's nothing that stands out substantially outside of history. I would comment that the ConstructConnect business is on the slides, recurring revenue growth has accelerated over the past several quarters. So that's a nice highlight for that business, good execution on the sales and marketing front. On Aderant, it's harder to tell. I mean it's a great quarter. Seasonally, the second quarter is generally strong for the business, just the way the market buys. And we'll just have to see how the pipeline builds specific to next quarter. I would conclude on the Aderant comment that the competitive landscape is stable, our value proposition is high, and nothing has changed in that regard. So the outlook for that business for the next several years remains nice.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thanks, folks.
Operator: That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. I'll now turn the call back to Zack Moxcey for closing remarks.
Zack Moxcey - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q1  (2017-04-28 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Robert Crisci – Vice President-Finance and Investor Relations Brian Jellison – President and Chief Executive Officer John Humphrey – Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Neil Hunn – Executive Vice President
Analysts: Deane Dray – RBC Capital Markets Robert McCarthy – Stifel, Nicolaus Joe Giordano – Cowen and Company Joe Ritchie – Goldman Sachs Steve Tusa – JP Morgan John Quealy – Canaccord Genuity
Operator: Your Roper Technologies First Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. All lines will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to your host, Robert Crisci, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Robert Crisci: Thank you, Jay, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the first quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Brian Jellison, John Humphrey, Paul Soni and Neil Hunn. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also are available on our website, www.ropertech.com. If you'll please turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. Now, please turn to Slide 3. Today, we'll be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our website. For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items. A $22 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions and $2 million of related commission expense. This represents revenue and commission that those companies would have recognized, if not for our acquisition. Lastly, a $72 million pre-tax adjustment for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. And now, if you please turn to Slide 4, I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. We will start by going through the first quarter enterprise results and then look at the specific segment detail for each of our 4 reporting segments and then talk about how we see the second quarter and the rest of the year and take your questions. So if we turn to the next Slide, Slide 5. We look at the Q1 enterprise results fundamentally, of course, our record first quarter for everything you can think of, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA, cash flow. Our revenue was up about 22% in the quarter to $1.108 billion and of that 5% was organic. Really broad-based growth, which we'll talk about in all 4 segments and specific improvements in our industrial and energy end markets. In February, we were at an investor conference and audience question, whether what could go wrong or what's still difficult and I said then, that there really – we didn't see any difficulties, there are continuing headwinds of the business that were meaningful, and I'm sitting here two months later and I have to get the same answer to that question, and we see really a breakout here for Roper in 2017. The DEPS were up 17% to $2.11. EBITDA was up 18% to $362 million. Our operating cash flow was up 55% to $378 million, and you don't want to be confused about the fact that last year, there was an even lower number that would make the operating cash flow look even higher because we had an adjustment around an out-of-period tax situation with the ABEL sale and record the fourth quarter, that was a $37 million adjustment. So we're quite content with being up 55% on that adjusted operating cash flow number the year before. The $378 million, we'll talk more about that during the course of the morning. Both Deltek and ConstructConnect came out of the box very well and have probably even more upside potential in 2018 and 2019 than we originally have forecast. We had a very interesting week-long strategic conference with all of our industrial and energy business leaders last week in Sarasota. That's the first time we've got everybody together in one large meeting for a couple of years. And the amount of product vitality that, that group's put together in the last couple of years during a more difficult economic time is really refreshing and all of those folks are very, very excited about returning to a growth forward nature, so that's good news. Next Slide. We look at the income statement. For the first quarter, you'll see the revenue at $1.108 billion versus $906 million last year. Gross profit, up 10 basis points to 62.2%. EBITDA, at 32.7% is down a little bit on a margin basis, but of course, up 18%. And that's just Deltek and ConstructConnect and the acquisition is coming in initially with a loop sort of looks like with less EBITDA on a margin basis. Tax rate in the quarter was 28.2%. We had a $7 million discrete item that we were aware of that we were going to get the benefit sometime during the year, but it actually hit just right in the quarter all of it. And you can see the detail. I'll tell you about what the GAAP rate was and what the amortization rate was when we apply 35% to that amortization. The net earnings then were $218 million and DEPS, as you can see, was $2.11. So next Slide. If we look at the cash flow side, this is sort of nothing short of spectacular. We had an exceptional first quarter although I would remind everybody that in the chart, you can see $888 million trailing 12 months of the end of quarter 1 of 2015, going up to $913 million and now, $1.135 billion. In the first quarter, we don't have any tax payments, so it's always a little bit better and then the second quarter, you wind up sort of with a double tax payment and then normal in the third, fourth. Our free cash flow in the quarter was $360 million, once again, just hardly any CapEx here. And we were able to reduce the debt in the first quarter by $370 million. So taking that down by $700 million, it'll be a very easy task for us. Our debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the quarter using the definition that is in the data range, minus 3.7x, and that actually gives us plenty of cushion in terms of what we said. So we're ahead of schedule using their definitions. We've always said that cash is the best measure of performance, and I think that really be brought home throughout the year as you watch what happens to our balance sheet and our cash. Next Slide. In terms of our asset-light business model, which has been a long journey for us. Finally this quarter for the first time, you'll see it's actually a negative working capital position. So as we grow now, we throw off cash instead of consuming cash, which is a rare business model that can get put into place. In the end of the first quarter, you can see every metric on this page was better than it has been previously. So inventory is down to 4.4% of sales and receivables were only 16%. So you look at that at 20.4%, but if you look at payables that are at 11.5% and then you look at deferred revenue skyrocketing to 11.8%, you got a negative 23.3% against the positive 20.4% and boom, there it is, a negative investment of 2.9%. If you go back on that journey five years ago in the first quarter of 2012, our inventory was 7.5%, now it's 7.4%. Our receivables were 16.9% and now, they're 16%. Our payables were 11.2% and now they're 11.5%. And our deferred revenue was 3.3%. Today, it's 11.8%, and that has changed us from being 10% positive on working capital to a negative number of 2.9% and of course, the amount of cash that, that throws off for us and our ability to deploy the cash is unprecedented at any time in Roper's history. You can see the deferred revenue nominal number at the bottom in the last two years has increased from $237 million to $514 million. So if you want to look at just one metric about really the reinvention of the company, it's right here on this slide. Next Slide. When we get into the segment detail, and I should have included this, the medical segment's at 72% gross margin, RF segment at 61% gross margin, industrial’s at 51% and energy's at 57%, which leaves us with an enterprise gross margin above 62%. Next Slide. So here, we start with energy systems, you'll see it had organic growth of 7%, and we had one business that was down, which we expected which is our Compressor Control business that will take a while longer to recover. If we excluded Compressor Controls, we actually were up organically 9% in the quarter in our Energy segment. Only oil and gas markets improved a bit. We wound up a sort of mid-single-digit growth. Terrific leverage in the business as you can see, the operating margins are up 380 basis points, operating profits up 25% on a revenue variance of plus 5. Really basically an improved outlook for the balance of the year. We don't really see any net negative businesses for the rest of the year, may be a slight pullback in CCC. And then when you think about the mix in energy systems, it's about 1/3 of that business is industrial and 2/3 are energy. So even though the revenue's $125 million, it really represents a little over $80 million that's directly associated with energy. So if we look at Industrial Technology, you can see here, that business was up by 8% organically. We had a little FX in there. And then you can see operating profit was up 15%, with revenue up 7%, so very strong leverage. OP margin up 190 basis points. Imagine that, an OP number of 29.2% for an industrial family of businesses. And inside that number, it's about 10% of that $183 million is really energy-related, so if you take the sort of $18 million for energy out of Industrial and the $80 plus million out of Energy, you wind up with about $100 million of total revenue that's energy related for the company. So it's around 8%, to maybe 8.5% of total enterprise revenue. And while it'll grow this year, you want to remember, it's a modest part of the enterprise. So in Industrial, we had kind of a high single – mid-single digits, maybe low single-digit growth at Neptune and term in was low high-end cycle stuff 6%, 7%. Material analysis was up dramatically in the quarter, double-digit growth there; and our upstream oil and gas businesses were up double digit, with outstanding leverage. We actually don't see any of the businesses in Industrial being down for the balance of the year, so all that gives us a kind of positive performance. And these things are sort of sorting themselves out to a situation where we probably think about 3 families within these 2 sectors of precision instruments, water businesses and energy businesses, and we'll talk more about that I think as the year goes forward. Next slide. So the next segment we talk about is Medical & Scientific Imaging. Really, this is the health care technology family of businesses. If you look at the mix of these, you can see organic revenue is up 5% for the sector as a whole. The Acute Care Software businesses, which include all of our connectivity business and laboratory businesses and the new genetic testing and workflow businesses with GeneInsight and Unit Connect as a family, internationally, we were up like 7%, sort of flat on the U.S. side and then up quite a bit on the diagnostic connectivity side and up substantially on decision technology business, though, which is Strata. When you look at that business and then compare it to the – along with the alternate site healthcare business, it was up kind of mid-single digits as well. We had a decent quarter out of MHA's GPO business; and then SHP and SoftWriters continue to be very much faster growing than other components in the area. Those 2 businesses, the Acute Care Software, which is like a half a dozen units and the alternate site healthcare, which is really 3 units and sort of run more like 5, they represent half of the total revenue for this segment. And then we have medical products, and that's about 35% of the segment's revenue. And the medical products, they were also up, everything sort of up mid-single digits when you add it together. But clearly, the big outperformer there is our Northern Digital business, which is moving into a number of activities that are beyond medical with the unique business that we have developed there, and that remains quite an exciting opportunity for us over the next several years. Imaging was actually up in the quarter. Gatan's life science technology we're getting more and more adoption on the cryo-EM. And Imaging represents about 15% of the segment, if you're trying to understand what's going on here. Operating margin was terrific at 34.4%, it's down 30 basis points only because we're continuing to invest at a fast clip in our genetic testing and workflow analysis. We have 2 revenue generators that won't be producing much profit for a little while longer in GeneInsight, Unit Connect, but they are very important pathways to the future for us around what we're achieving. In the rest of the year, Q2 through Q4, would be sort of similar to this quarter: broad-based medical growth, we think will continue, still at least at this sort of 5% level. Hopefully, we continue to get the market adoption of the new technologies with imaging. We don't see anything slowing that down. So overall for the segment, I think we'd wind up with this mid-single-digit organic growth. Next slide. On RF Technologies, far and away the largest segment now, $451 million in revenue, up 60%, largely driven by ConstructConnect and Deltek joining the company here for the entire first quarter. Organic revenue was 4%, a little bit of FX here. In terms of talking about the Deltek and ConstructConnect, we could sort of have a full individual slide on them. Our governance model's in place and working well inside these businesses. We've had Mike Corkery who runs Deltek and Dave Conway who runs ConstructConnect out talking to some of our investors. People getting exposed to just how great those businesses are. As we spend more time with them together, they're finding more opportunities for working together to accelerate growth. And I think neither of the businesses independently thought might be there, so they seem to be quite encouraged about that. Deltek's looking at a much larger GovCon opportunity as a result of the various things you see going at government these days, and they have a very large opportunity for adding paying customers to people that from time to time have subscribed to that software. They also were very successful in launching their professional service that's first stage. We have a – sort of 3-stage of rollout and the first one was launched on time and is up and running. When you look at the rest of the software businesses, that's a wide variety of things, from freight matching, to iTradeNet or CBORD, Horizon, On Center, Aderant legal software and the like. They were all up around mid-single digits as well, and they are, of course, incredible cash contributors. On the toll and traffic side, it was kind of a bifurcated quarter, with the intelligent transportation systems side was up double digits. But most of that's driven by the Transsuite software platform we have and projects that we've talked about before, Riyadh and the New York area. Those don't carry much in the way of tax. And so we saw deterioration in tag revenue in the first quarter, which we actually had expected but nonetheless, it's a big negative. It was down 36% in the quarter, and it carries much higher margin. So where you look over here on the OP margin, and you can see it's 24.1%, the core being down 210 basis points was specifically Amtech tag shipments softness. And we won't see that getting massively better throughout the year. It's still a very lumpy business with agency timings, and it'll be a very high-quality business. But we put the 2 together, we wound up with kind of low single-digit growth in the tolling activity. For the balance of the year, you can see we think that software businesses continue to grow with strong margins and really, outstanding cash performance. We think that the segment as a whole should be up 60%, but certainly, a lot of that, most of that is coming from Deltek and ConstructConnect acquisitions. And overall, we'll get a kind of mid-single-digit organic growth out of the segment because the tag shipments are going to drag down the overall number. But we could get some infrastructure tolling, but we're not – we're holding our breath on whatever is going to happen with the government in that respect. But if you did get an infrastructure bill, it certainly could improve our outlook from being low single digits to a better number. And then we thought it would be useful, you can see a pie chart here, to try to have everybody clearly understand the mix of what's going on in the segment now. So while we call it RF Technology and software, you'll see 65% of the revenue in the segment is coming from software. And that doesn't even count the toll and traffic software, which we just leave inside that because there's back-office software and there's Transsuite, so it would take it up to an even larger number. The tolling thing is about 25% of revenue, but a portion of that is really Amtech RF products that go along with the other RF products that are buying, so Technolog and Amtech's Royale Business and Teletrance and things like that. So the product, physical products, are about 10% and tolling is around 25% and software is around 65% and, of course, growing. Next slide. We get to guidance and I've got to turn the page here to Slide 14. So on the guidance, we're raising the full year guidance from $8.82 to $8.98 on the low-end and the high-end from $9.22 to $9.28, gives an $0.11 increase at the midpoint to $9.13. Revenue, we've raised from 20% to 22% to 21% to 22% because we're raising organic from 3% to 5%, to 4% to 5%. The cash flow, still looks to us like it's right at about $1.150 billion. That's around 24%, maybe even 25% of revenue, so just remains an astonishing performance. I do want to remind people that the $378 million in the first quarter is cash flow, it didn’t have any tax payment in it and the tax is generally ran around $85 million a quarter, so you’ll get that double hit in Q2 and the normalize tax in Q3 and Q4. Our guidance for the second quarter, we said it will be $2.16 to $2.24. CapEx for the year is going to be sort of what generally is around 1.5% of revenue, may be it will be $65 million to $70 million, and that will include any capitalized software that's in the acquired businesses. Our tax rate is going to be somewhere around the 30% level. And may be it could be a little bit higher than that. That should probably be in the sort of 30%. I think there's not much more to say there. If you guys all know what the interest costs are for the balance of the year, and so you can kind see how that operating cash flow will go by quarter that reached $1.150 billion or more at the end of the year. Next slide. So we look at the Q1 summary. Certainly, we had record results across everything that matters, a very broad organic growth across all four segments, nothing really holding us back anymore. We've got DEPS up 17% to $2.11; EBITDA, up 15% to $362 million. We reduced the debt by $370 million in the quarter so we got really a rapid strengthening of the balance sheet, which we expected, and we still have $650 million or more outside the U.S. and so we're kind of waiting to see just what happens on repatriation, and that will be very a dramatic benefit for us. And ConstructConnect and Deltek are really performing very well and the opportunities in these businesses is very much what we thought it was, probably more. Next slide. If you look sort of strategically about the quarter, you can see now how we're really benefiting from what we did in 2015 and 2016. So instead of hunkering down at the time of economic challenge. We really took the time to reinvent ourselves for the second time. First time we did this was back in 2003 and 2004 when we acquired Neptune and TransCore. And really, the second time around with the acquisition of ConstructConnect and Deltek is going to give us the same kind of positive results but with even better cash compounding along the way. Over half of the EBITDA in the enterprise now comes from software and from network businesses, and that doesn't count any of the software contributions we get out of TransCore's back office of Transsuite business or from Compressor Controls' software; even higher if we added those in. The deferred revenue is increasing our ability to compound cash. We now have over $0.5 billion of deferred revenue, and it's always good to use other people's money. Net working capital is now in negative territory, so we get to generate cash as we grow instead of having to have been consumed by the growth in things that show up in working capital. Our cash return on investment has been rapidly improving. The typical multi-industry guys are probably running somewhere between 20%, to 40%, 45%. We're going to be running over 200% by the end of the year. And you'll hear more about that as the year goes on. We have newly elected officers that all take their positions on May 15. So we have two Executive Vice Presidents, Neil Hunn and Paul Soni. Neil is getting close to his sixth year with the company. He's now an elected officer effective May 15. His responsibilities include pretty much all of the Medical segment with the exception of Imaging and most of the new software acquisitions, so a very broad piece of the portfolio. Paul Soni is leaving his role as Principal Accounting Officer, which he's been here for over a decade with me doing that to take on a series of executive leadership roles, most of which will be announced a little later. It'll involve some of our specific businesses and a wide variety of the senior process, things that need to happen here. Bob Crisci, as you know, has been our Inventor Relations and financial planning person, will be taking over as Chief Financial Officer in a couple of weeks and certainly, been acting like that for a couple of months. And Jason Conley, who used to be our Investor Relations person, you'd remember and financial analysis guy, went out to MHA to be their CFO and then as we acquired the software companies to expand MHA with SoftWriters and SHP, Jason was the person driving the integration and supporting the coaching of bringing those new organizations inside and he's returning back to the Sarasota headquarters from New Jersey. No taxes for Jason. And he'll be starting May 15 as our Principal Accounting Officer, which gives us a really fantastic team of well-educated and passionate and tireless people. All these appointments came from within Roper, which we're very proud of. And it really speaks volumes to the depth of the organization, talent we have and the strength of our leadership development process. Every one of these people has had multiyear plans in place for different exposures to different roles and different types of business, all of which supports our succession planning and positions us to have a leadership team that's very, very connected to the continuing execution of our strategy. And with that, I think we can open up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll go for to Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
Brian Jellison: Hey good morning Deane.
Deane Dray: I just want to start off with a congratulations to John on his retirement announcement, and I do remember when John joined as the rookie CFO, and you've come a long way and congrats and enjoy your retirement.
John Humphrey: Thank you Deane. I appreciate that.
Deane Dray: And just maybe to start off and, Brian, I know you sized the energy piece, but it was such a headwind for the company for the past year, and it's nice seeing that snapback. Maybe give us some color on how you expect to see these, especially the upstream businesses, come back here and maybe touch on Roper Pumps. I know it's a small piece, but it really was a ground zero with the fall off in fracking and you've built new capacity in Houston. And what's your expectations on the recovery there?
Brian Jellison: Well, it was up double digits in the quarter on the revenue side and up like 40% on the profit, maybe a little more, very high leverage. Orders continue to be pretty strong for that business. One of the reasons we had everybody together in all the product businesses last week was to sort of make sure we're ahead of what's going to happen for the balance of the year and next year and beyond, make sure we're smart about looking at – we kind of look at the whole product family as being responsive to the customers pulling stuff other than us pushing stuff to them. So we're kind of big process review, talking about cost push inflation, capacity utilization, risk of supplier interruptions, material cost escalations, and those kinds of things. I think that the broker enjoys a unique position if you got an expansion of fracking. And they could be up sharply. But you're right that they were off so much. We tried a couple of years ago to articulate the mix between upstream, midstream and downstream by taking apart a wide variety of businesses when we kind of. But it's almost better to just say here's the six or seven businesses that are primarily in that area. Roper Pump gets reported in industrial and really is an energy asset. I mean it could be up 40% this year, but it's very nice incrementally, but it's not – won't be overly meaningful. I mean, that's a business that used to be $100 million, it went down to $40 million. And it was up 30%, it will be a $52 million business so half of what it was in 2014 but a dramatic improvement.
Deane Dray: Certainly, and I'd rather be in a position explaining the nature of the snapback than where we were a year ago. Just switching over to Deltek and ConstructConnect. Brian, you alluded to some potential upside versus what you had initially discussed at the time of the acquisitions; pointing to the government opportunity, adding subscribers and professional services. Can you expand on that and how you expect to see those opportunities develop and maybe quantify what the upside might be?
Brian Jellison: Yes. I think the quantification would be more in terms of forward growth rates, so maybe mid-single digits and high single digits. I'll ask Neil to talk a little bit about what they see in terms of professional services with these new launches of products and a little bit around the GovCon opportunity.
Neil Hunn: Sure, Deane. So let's do Deltek first. What we've been talking with the team there and doing our reviews this quarter, Mike Corkery said, and he's a pretty conservative guy, former CFO of the enterprise, that almost an unprecedented level of activity around building the sales pipeline in the low to mid-market side of government contracting. And so fortunately, we're well positioned there on the ERP side of GovCon work. But it is just that. It's building funnel. The funnel's got to mature. It's got to convert. It's got to get implemented before it becomes sort of well into to our financials. So it's a good position to be, and I'm certain the end-market reasons for that are obvious around Trump and infrastructure and all that. I think the subcontractor universe is getting ready for that. Relative to the product development, it's really a machine in terms of what Namita does with her team there. There's ordinary run rate development work that they do and when we bought the business, there was an internal project that had 3 phases that was above and beyond that and the first deliverable of that, Deltek for professional services, was released in the quarter on time, on schedule, on budget, but it's just it's a new category. We're a challenger in the category, and it'll be sort of what we expect that to be a slow build over a long period of time in terms of building that business for us but we have the product now to attack that market. So we're very encouraged about – we've only been with the business now for 3 or 4 months, but it's very encouraging to start. On – and that's the summary on Deltek.
Brian Jellison: Okay, that's good. So maybe we're going to think we've got another 1 point, or 1.5 points, 2 points of organic down the road of what we thought when we bought it.
Operator: The next question will come from Robert McCarthy with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Robert McCarthy: Congratulations on a solid quarter; great growth. You've heard the song remains the same. And I guess, you're not a one-man band anymore, Brian, right? Given all these...
Brian Jellison: I am at this moment in time, Robert. The people just – some people don't believe it.
Robert McCarthy: But I guess, since we're on the topic and, obviously, we've had a succession. And again, I will echo the comments of Deane; congratulations, John, on a wonderful career. And, Rob, best wishes going forward. Have you – is there anything you can share about the Chairman, CEO succession planning from your standpoint? And that doesn't mean you have to share with me your Fitbit of your cholesterol or your vitals, so...
Brian Jellison: Well, I'm happy to do that if I were [indiscernible]. So actually, I'm not concerned about the succession at all. I think it's wonderful. I'm not a modest owner of the stock, so I've never sold a share of stock in my life since I arrived here, so it's finally accumulated to a meaningful number. I had to get rid of options because they expire in 10 years and so as that would take the crap out of me, but anyway, it is what it is. The opportunity for us adding capital value to the enterprise is the best it's ever been in our history. The company is going kind of through its second phase of reinvention. We had a marvelous run after Neptune and TransCore. And now, we're going to have the same situation again. The things that we can deploy capital to acquire are phenomenal opportunities, much better than what we were limited to, say, 10 years ago. So all that feel is really good. I think you can see from all of the new executive moves are from internal people. I think the board and myself, would be extremely disappointed if we didn't have an internal successor, but virtually everybody was here. We went outside a year ago to bring in a General Counsel because we wanted some specific knowledge about business acuity that we thought needed to come from an outside source. But other than that, I don't see why we would need to bring outside people, but we very much value the culture and the connectivity of everything we do. On our values page, the number 1 thing we have up there is we believe that cash return on investment drives shareholder value. And we're not too interested in somebody coming in with a different paradigm that thinks that businesses trade on some other foundation because they do not. They trade on cash return. It's an ingrained principle. It's – every part of our governance process is really characterized around that. When we had our strategic meeting with our product people last week, and we showed them everything that had happened numerically from 2011 by year through 2016 and what their vitality index of strategies looked like through 2019. I just don't think people do that. And we do that in spades, and we do it with numbers, so that people can go away from here and execute. So those are strong reasons why the board would be very much interested in assuring that we have put in place all the leadership succession processes that we need to have everybody immediately available to take over all the roles.
Robert McCarthy: And as a follow-up, which I think is related, obviously, you go to Slide 8, and you see what's going on there in terms of the asset-light business model on working capital. And then you start to think about the broad-based recovery on the macro side, the strength you're seeing in recovering energy markets. It's probably a good time for valuations from a standpoint of exiting assets and also potentially contemplating separation, particularly in the context of your kind of thoughts around the second phase of the company. Could you talk about kind of the puts and takes around potential separation or how you're thinking about perhaps divesting some assets to basically refine or – refine the overall portfolio?
Brian Jellison: Well, it really hasn't changed at all. You have the same forces of work. So you have the product nature of the company, the old energy and the industrial base businesses have very low tax bases. So as long as it's a 35%-plus leakage on whatever you get, people would have to pay a huge premium for us to get a net yield that was re-investable at the kind of rate we'd like to have. So we think the market reasonably understands what the portfolio looks like. There's certainly people have been – have approached us throughout the last couple of years with various reverse Morris trust concepts around some portions of the portfolio. We've talked about that sort of openly and the challenge is that people that approach us are guys that have 38% gross margins and 18% EBITDA. And you look at these businesses that have gross margins of 51% and 57%, and EBITDA margins at 30%, they marvel at them, and they can't figure out where are their synergies. Now the reason they can't is there aren't any. It would be – you need to acquire them and drive them on a CRI perspective, and we're not doing that. So our rate of reinvestment will continue to be driven around the kind of asset-light businesses and cash returns that you get out of the software businesses that we've been acquiring. So those core product businesses simply are going to grow at a faster organic rate for a couple of years. They'll throw off more cash. That gives us an opportunity to invest that in very high return and slightly better growth businesses. So I don't think anything's changed in that respect.
Operator: Now we'll take a question from Joe Giordano from Cowen and Company.
Joe Giordano: I wanted to just talk about Deltek and ConstructConnect. Is there any sort of – how can those businesses work together? Is there any sort of like go-to-market strategy to leverage the 2 offerings to the customers, in particular, or is there – are they kind of – I know they're independent, but is there a way to kind of leverage that together?
Brian Jellison: Well, with – the nature of the word and whether it's a verb or not is important. So we wouldn't force leverage putting 2 world-class businesses that developed independently together. But we're more than happy to facilitate the opportunity for the 2 businesses to look at how they can use each other customers to basically drive access to channel a customer that they wouldn't have if they weren't owned by the same company. Deltek and ConstructConnect each have massive goodwill in terms of how customers feel about them. So it is infinitely easier for a Deltek contact to a ConstructConnect customer knowing that it's part of that family. The receptivity is higher and the same thing is true, so sharing that customer opportunity is a big deal. And we allow cooperation and then kind of let the businesses – really, Corkery and Conway, they're CEOs of their businesses. And that's true of all these large businesses, with Hawkins the CEO of Acute Care and Sicilian's the CEO of Alternate Site. So we'll let Neil maybe tell you about how these early meetings have been so fruitful.
Neil Hunn: Yes. So we'll break it down both on the channel and on the product. On channel side, remember that Deltek is very – it's 40% market share globally in architecture and engineering as a vertical for professional services. They're a challenger in construction in the AC space and ConstructConnect lives in the construction space. ConstructConnect has 41,000 paying subcontractors and 850,000 subcontractors in their network. And so you can immediately see the opportunity to work together around regeneration on the product and – on the go-to-market strategy. On the product side, the core part of what ConstructConnect does is aggregate content and data that allows all the various building product manufacturers, GCs and subs, to know what projects are in the funnel. Deltek has a similar but different product that allows government contractors to know what sort of government contracting work's in the bid pipeline. So there's opportunity to sort of enrichen the data of – between both businesses and sharing content. So it's very much a tandem strategy, but it's being led organically by the 2 leaders of the business. It happened – they knew each other a little bit before when they became part of the fold within the same quarter. They immediately reached to out to each other. These meetings are occurring without intervention from the team here in Sarasota.
Joe Giordano: That's great color there. I appreciate that. If you guys were to look at the businesses that are snapping back here a little bit after definitely easier comps because that's part of it, but if you were to maybe try to strip out seasonality and look at it on a sequential basis going forward looking at your order patterns, how do you see that? Was it – do you look at it more of a step-up to just a higher run rate, or is it kind of – are you seeing month-on-month continued kind of acceleration on a sequential basis more than on a year-on-year basis?
Brian Jellison: Well, these things generally will have a stronger second quarter and fourth quarter on a seasonality basis. But when you're bouncing back from a situation that's artificially low, you could get sequential improvement all the time. We certainly will have sequential improvement second quarter over the first. So Rob, you may want to...
Robert Crisci: Yes, I think there is sequential improvement. The run rates with the Roper Pump and any of the upstream businesses, they're certainly up and that should continue throughout the year. And then, on a year-over-year basis, right, we're talking about mid-single-digit growth for each of the Industrial and Energy segment, than when we talked to you 3 months ago, we were looking more like low single digit.
Joe Giordano: Right, right, right. Just one last like nitpick on the guys just to get a sense of where you're looking. So the full year guide, up less than the magnitude of beating 1Q. Is there just – should we think about that as a bit of conservatism or you're kind of maybe factoring in some of this happening already and it's less of a surprise? How would you reconcile those things?
Brian Jellison: No, I think we just think that moving up from 3% organic to 4% is a 33% increase, right? So 4% to 5% organic is pretty strong for the enterprise. I think we'll have the one organic headwind for the year is going to be that portion of toll and traffic that's related to tags is going to be off, and it could be off $20 million at least this year unless there's some resurgence in new tolling activity, which there could well be because our bid process is off the charts. So there's lots of activity, but right now, we're relying on the base, and we'll have to see. But I don't think it's conservatism. But I think you've got to remember how small this whole thing is. If you look at all of that Industrial and Energy, you're looking at something that's about 25% or 28%. So if you've got something, it would have to be up quite substantially more than the kind of 4% mid-single digits we're talking about it for it be very material, so...
Robert Crisci: Yes, I'd just add to that. For the first quarter, the Medical and RF segments were right where we expected them to be and the outlook there for the rest of the year is just as we had it coming in for the year. So really, the only change is better environment in Industrial and Energy and rolling that forward for the year. And as Brian pointed out, that's a smaller percentage of the company than it used to be.
Operator: And now we'll take a question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie: So I guess my first question, with clearly great cash generation this quarter, I guess, Brian, as I kind of think about your cash profile moving forward, I'm trying to just maybe understand how I should think about that deferred revenue number as a percentage of sales clearly getting close to 12% this quarter. How do you think about that on a more normalized basis? And how do you think about like trade working capital on a more normalized basis?
Brian Jellison: It's normalized right now at negative 2.9%. There's nothing cyclical about that. We get more and more deferred revenue, it becomes a positive thing, right. So the more you grow, if you're paying in advance for what you do, the more deferred revenue you get. So welcome to probably the first negative working capital company in your coverage.
Joe Ritchie: That is – you guys would be the first negative working capital company in my coverage. I guess, the – at least at this stage of the cycle. Okay, that's helpful. I guess, my second question, and it relates to this, is if you think about your leverage, you're now down to 3.7, I think that in the conversations that we had last quarter, I think kind of a goal this year was to kind of get into like the mid-3s. It seems like you're definitely accelerating beyond that. Can you get below 3? Is the goal now to get below 3x net leverage at the end of the year?
Brian Jellison: No, I think we don't have any goal. We have certain covenants and certain requirements, and we can't exceed 4 without mentioning it to people. And we expect to get down easily to meet all of our commitments and our covenants. So it's much more likely we would run routinely at 3x debt-to-EBITDA than we would run routinely at 3.5x debt-to-EBITDA. And if we didn't do other acquisitions, I wouldn't borrow that. That's we wouldn't do this year. We'd certainly be down to levels like – and you can see we're going to have $1 billion of free cash flow. Other than increasing our dividend for the 25th time and become a dividend aristocrat, I don't think you'll see us have another deployment unless it's an acquisition.
Joe Ritchie: Okay, fair enough. And if I could maybe sneak in one more, and I know it's a smaller piece of your business today, but both Industrial and the Energy pieces of your business saw incredibly good incremental margins this quarter. And I know that you guys have kind of growth rates staying mid-single digits. So should we be expecting like pretty elevated incremental margins then throughout the rest of the year in both those businesses?
Robert Crisci: Yes, I think for those 2 segments, as you grow, we would expect really strong leverage, similar to what you saw in the first quarter because of where they are after the cost reductions over the past couple of years. On the way back up, we would expect pretty strong leverage.
Operator: We'll now move to our next question, and that will come from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan.
Steve Tusa: John, congratulations, again.
John Humphrey: Thanks.
Steve Tusa: So I didn't see the orders in the presentation. What were organic orders up in the quarter?
Brian Jellison: I don't know. All the data's in there. Book to bill is 1.01…
Robert Crisci: Organic orders for the company, plus 3.
Brian Jellison: Yes.
Steve Tusa: Plus 3?
Robert Crisci: And Industrial and Energy is where we – is where the orders number really matters and it was up 1.06 in Industrial and 1.01 in Energy. It's a less useful metric.
Brian Jellison: Book-to-bill.
Robert Crisci: Yes, book-to-bill. It's a less useful metric for the Medical and RF side.
Steve Tusa: Right, okay, okay, but up 3 in orders, that's great. And then, is it normal for you guys to – kind of going back to McCarthy's question, is it normal for you guys to have, like, 2 specific segments for one of these kind of enterprise meetings? I mean I'm just – I've never heard of a company that says let's invite these 2 specific segments for kind of that type of company-wide meeting. I mean, have you guys done that before? Have you done that with other segments where you just kind of like cherry pick a couple of the segments out of the portfolio to meet together?
Brian Jellison: No, no, we bring together people together that have great connectivity. So all of our Energy and Industrial people have similar kinds of challenges that we monitor and provide guidance to and measure. We have a separate strategic planning session with our medical companies. That was conducted in December when they're all together in the same place for a week. So we do those things in logical ways. There's no sense bringing a company together that's writing code for software with a pump manufacturer.
Steve Tusa: Right, right. It's kind of like industrial analysts covering a software company. That was a joke. So is this kind of a precursor to maybe collapsing the reporting on those 2 segments?
Brian Jellison: No, I don't – I wouldn't do read much in to those things. I think what would you see is for a couple years, I said we – it would be helpful for us, and we're trying to do that in this quarter again, to get really good clarity around. So how much energy exposure do you have in Energy and Industrial because they're not really clean segments. The Energy segment is about 2/3 energy and 1/3 industrial; and the Industrial segment's like 10% to 12% energy and 88% industrial. And so that's our fault, and it confuses people and we'll try to make that – I think we've made it quite clear this morning, but you'll continue to see clarity come in that area.
Operator: And now we'll hear from John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity.
John Quealy: My congratulations to everybody on the promotions. Just one question for me. Broadly speaking, can you talk across the platform on the hardware businesses, price and volume trends? And then on the software businesses, sub-ads or retention rates.
Brian Jellison: One of the great things about the company is we don't really have any standard products. There are just a few areas like residential, water meters, that they don't have the intelligent controls on them. So we're all an application company. It's very difficult for somebody to say what's the price yield because you don't have a SKU that you're following, and you can look at the SKU by channel. So you can always best measure it by looking at the gross margin in the enterprise, right. So pricing power comes from the quality of the product or service or technology you're applying and our gross margins continue to go up all the time. And so that is a pretty effective productivity measurement of whether or not you're getting the pricing opportunity that's available. You won't find Roper unilaterally raising prices like perhaps some private equity group might do for a short-term gain. We're going to have our pricing match the reality of sort of free market that we operate in over a long period of time. So as a rule, I would say we got some modest pricing in everything we do versus the prior year.
Operator: And that will end our question-and-answer session. We'll return back to Robert Crisci for closing remarks.
Robert Crisci: Excellent. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we look forward to speaking to you in 3 more months.
Operator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your call for today. We do thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Roper Technologies Fourth Quarter 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Robert Crisci, VP of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Rob Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Laurie, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the fourth quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Humphrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Neil Hunn, Group Vice President. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also are available on our website. Now, if you'll please turn to slide two. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we'll be making forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now, please turn to slide three. Today, we'll be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our website. For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of two items. First, a $7.2 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized, if not for our acquisition. Second, a $6.1 million adjustment for acquisition-related expenses, primarily related to the ConstructConnect and Deltek acquisitions which were completed in the quarter. And now, if you'll please turn to slide four, I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everybody. We'll start out by reviewing how the fourth quarter was, and a few comments about how the total 2016 finished. Then a segment detail on outlook for each of the four reporting segments. We'll look at how the first quarter looks from a guidance view point and the full year, establish our cash flow guidance for the year, and then take your questions. Next slide, slide five. So, if we look at the fourth quarter, we had record results in terms of orders, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA, cash flow and a lot of other areas as well. Orders were really spectacular, up 17%. Our book-to-bill was 1.07x. For those of you who follow the company closely, we always say something like a 0.97x to 1.02x is a trend line that doesn't tell you all that much, but if you get below that or above that it tells you a lot, and this sort of rate tells you a great deal about 2017. We had organic order growth in all four segments, although I think Energy was maybe 0.1%. But it's still – that's the first time in a long time, organic orders were up 11%, now about half of that comes from the New York City tunnel project, but without that it's still very outstanding organic growth. Our revenue in the quarter was up 7% to $1.18 billion with 2% organic growth. Our gross margin was up 50 basis points to $62.3 million. We're still making some margin improvement even with extraordinarily high numbers to begin with. Our EBITDA in the quarter was up 7% to $365 million and our operating cash flow for the entire year for the first time in our history exceeded $1 billion. We completed an important bond offering in December that sort of protected us from the vagaries of what might have happened going forward. The interest rates at the time certainly saved us a good deal of money. We deployed $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, acquiring Deltek and ConstructConnect and these are really transformational acquisitions for us, partly because of their size. But they really take us into software end markets and professional services, gives us a lot more diversification than our software which had been concentrated in supply-chain activities and medical application. So, moving greatly into professional service gives us a lot of ramp around other things we can acquire over the next several years. And it was a quarter-ago in which we hit several milestones and really some transformational things that outline how we're going to perform over the next three to five years. Next slide. If we look at the income statement, you can see pretty much all those things reflected that we just commented on orders, revenue, gross profit. The tax rate down there you can see was 29.8% versus 28.8%. So it was a 1% headwind which cost us about $0.02 to $0.03 in the quarter, notwithstanding that DEPS were $1.86 versus $1.82 last year. Next slide. Compounding cash flow is really what creates so much shareholder value for all of you over time. And, here you can see that despite the Energy headwinds, which have been ferocious for the company for the last two years, it's really remarkable that we've had 19% growth over the last two years in operating cash flow, despite a huge cash headwind in Energy. So in the fourth quarter, our conversion of operating cash flow, you can see was 142%. Our free cash flow at $259 million represented 25% of revenue. And for the full-year, our operating cash flow, which is a little over $1 billion, with 149% conversion, we continue to move up sort of cash flow to revenue. Back in 2014, it was 23.7%, and of course people are scared to death we couldn't possibly maintain it, and here in 2016 it's 26.3%. So, everybody here is very proud of the $1 billion operating cash flow for the first time. It's quite a milestone and hats off to everybody at Roper for doing that. Next slide. The asset-light business model, this will really cement a critical awareness of people about just how big a cash compounder we are and we're going to be. If you look at this slide, which we generally show you each time, people often times think it just couldn't get better. In 2014, you see that our net working capital as a function of revenue was 5%. Last year in 2015 it was 3.5%. This year it's 1.8%, cut in half, and it's important to look at the component, so you can see inventories dropped from 5.1% to 4.6% in the last two years, receivables are up 20 basis points from 16.1% to 16.3%, payables and accruals are up 80 basis points from 11.1% to 11.9%, but the big change here is deferred revenue. Deferred revenue was 5% in 2014 year-end and in the fourth quarter, we exclude acquisition. So, in December 2015, we excluded Aderant and Atlas that had some deferred revenue, and yet it was still 6.5%. This year as we close out, we exclude ConstructConnect and Deltek and store up the 7.2%. This is hugely important because if you look on our balance sheet that's attached to the income statement, you'll see that deferred revenue in 2015 was $267 million. You'll now see that deferred revenue is up to $488 million, but this is not reflected in our graph here at 7.2%. So you can imagine that that 1.8% number, which is insanely low compared to multi-industry companies, is actually going to become negative in 2017. This is why we get so much more cash to revenue than virtually anybody else. It's truly a transformational change in our cash return and to get a concept of how important this is, ten years ago we told people that our inventory was 9% of revenue, today it's 4.5%. We told people receivables were 17.4%, today they are 16.3%. We told people payables and accruals were 15%, today they are 11.9%. But now we have 7.2% of deferred revenue and as we report in the first quarter, you'll see that number escalate. So all of the acquisitions that we've been doing the last two years, $5.5 billion worth of investment, has helped to drive these incredible numbers to rates that just haven't been seen before. Next slide. Here we look at the segment detail and we'll look at each of the four segments. Next slide. We start with Energy Systems. The Energy Systems business actually had a book-to-bill of 1.02x. We had organic growth in orders in the Energy segment of 7%, so you got a little bit of improvement in the fourth quarter. Organic revenue, trailing of course is still minus 8%. Oil and gas was down about 15%, but that's actually the best negative V for a while. So headwinds have really been abating in that and this Energy segment, about two thirds of it is oil and gas related activity. The Industrial Test and Measurement portions of the business actually grew, and we had this sort of positive book-to-bill ratio around that. In 2017, we think the segment'll be sort of flat to low single-digit growth, off of the base that you see here. Then if we look at the Industrial segment, which is far less influenced by oil and gas, but nonetheless, still has Roper Pump in it, so that's a major component. Its organic orders were up 1%. The organic revenue was down 1%. Material analysis was strong in the quarter. Neptune continued to perform brilliantly. We had some sequential improvement for the first time at Roper Pump as rig counts moved up, and so Roper Pump sequentially was up about 8%. That said, that business alone in the last two years is off by $50 million of revenue and represents that drag that we've had. We think that goes away this year. If we look at the results for the segment as a whole, we think it's going to be up sort of low-single digits, because we won't get much out of the Energy portions, but we get a lot more out of the other pieces of that segment. If you combine these two when you look at it, which I was doing just in preparation here for the talk today, the combined revenue for these two was $321 million of revenue and had $98 million in OP. So it's really remarkable how great these businesses are. There are 30.5% OP to sales in markets that have been declining. So the guys who run these businesses have really performed in an outstanding way the last two years. Next slide. We look at the Medical segment. You'll see a book-to-bill here of 1.09. Organic orders were up 8%. Total orders were up 15%. Imaging revenue was down 4%, but Medical organic growth was up 5%. The way that we look at the businesses, there are really three primary areas, the Acute Care Software business, and it was up led by connectivity solutions between the lab instrumentation that we provide software for and the data gathering requirements that the hospital needs. And then, Strata's Decision Support Software continues to grow at a spectacular rate. The Alternate Site Healthcare business, which includes MHA, but very importantly includes our Software businesses, SoftWriters and SHP, the Software businesses grew well and the Long Term Care Pharmacy business grew in the fourth quarter. The medical products business, which includes a variety of physical products, its growth was led by Northern Digital, and we have technology that a rapidly increasing people of OEMs that we really sign contracts with, I can't discuss because of the proprietary nature of the product, have really interesting growth opportunities in Electromagnetic Measurement Technology area, and we're really at the forefront of that. So, there is some very important people that we've been working with, and increasingly signing those up, and prospects for that area are quite good. Scientific Imaging in the quarter was up on orders. It's about 15% of the segment these days. Book- to-bill was the strongest it's been over the long time at 1.12. In 2017, we actually believe Imaging will grow because of the cryo-EM opportunity that we have there and certain spectroscopy technology that we introduced this past year. In Medical, we just think we get sort of broad-based medical growth continues at kind of mid single digit growth that we've enjoyed for several years, and there are a series of initiatives that really we're culminating in 2016 and the early part of this year that should make our performance in a growth area, internal organic growth, brighter in 2018 and beyond than it's been in the recent past. And the Medical segment, really in the last two years, is up $283 million in revenue. So, that has largely offset the sort of drag, about $265 million drag, we had out of Energy and Industrial, and especially when you exclude the Abel disposition. Next slide. Here we would look at RF Technology. That segment will explode of course in 2017. You can see on the chart here, its book-to-bill was 1.10 in the fourth quarter. Organic orders were up 24%, a good deal of that was the New York City tunnel project, most of which got booked in the fourth quarter, and total orders are up 38%. Organic revenue was up 8%. Growth in the toll and traffic applications was strong in the quarter, and, importantly, we had a faster start to the all-electronic tolling in the New York City bridge and tunnel program than we expected. We did about $15 million in the fourth quarter, and that leaves us, the total project is about $52 million for the installation and technology purchase. So it gives us maybe $37 million for the coming year. Then there is another $20 million in maintenance that lasts for like $5 million a year for four years to get us back to the $72 million number we were talking about. So excellent start to that. We had sort of middle single-digit organic growth in our Software businesses. Freight matching did a little better than that. CBORD had a particularly strong quarter, up double digits with security deployments for universities. Aderant continued to lock in gain share in the large law office component. We completed the Deltek and ConstructConnect acquisitions, which really greatly expands our application software footprint and capabilities. It gives us some new platforms for growth in professional services. There are a lot of interesting things; end markets to explore and other things to bolt on to the business. And if you look over at this revenue graph, you see it going from $904 million to $1.224 billion. We put this 2017 chart on there, we'd have to change the whole page, because we're going to do over $1.9 billion in RF & Software in 2017. So, in 2014, it was up $47 million, and in 2015, it was up $86 million. Last year, it was up $187 million. It'll be up $650 million to $700 million or more this year. So we think we'll continue in 2017 with strong software growth, with really incredible cash performance out of this businesses. We'll continue to grow in toll and traffic projects, but a lot of this is trans-suite (17:35) software projects, which don't involve toll tax. So for the year, we should have nice growth out of completing the New York City project and the continuation of our Saudi project, but we're going to have fewer tag shipments and we've seen a fall-off in tags in 2016 related to railcars, which wouldn't surprise anybody and people tend to forget about it. But we have a tag on every railcar that gets produced. Next line is our segment revenue is expected to grow about 60% with huge contributions from ConstructConnect and Deltek. Incrementally those people will probably add about $650 million of revenue this year versus last year when we got a little bit of contribution out of them in the fourth quarter. In total then, organic revenue ought to be sort of in the mid single-digits, but the big story is all the added growth that you see there. Next slide. Next slide is just a page identifier that we're going to now talk about 2017 guidance. So we'll go to the next slide. In establishing the 2017 guidance, we've got an adjustment in terms of what we're adding to our adjusted numbers. A lot of people have asked us about this. We've sort of explained our view historically, and a increasing number of you think this is something we ought to do. We've given it a lot of thought. We've looked at a lot of information and do think it is a better way to report our earnings with taking the acquisition-related intangible amortization affecting it by tax and including it in the adjustment. So you'll see we didn't talk about that at all during the fourth quarter discussion, but we'll be talking about it from now on, as the way we'll report earnings and compare our performance against the prior year. There is additional information you'll see in our appendix that can help you with that. Full year 2017 guidance then would be an adjusted earnings number of $8.82 to $9.22 a share. That represents about 20% to 22% revenue growth for the company in 2017, of which 3% to 5% would be organic. We're assuming a tax rate of about 30%, everybody has heard the conversations about how much somebody like Roper would be benefited if you had a change in business tax, but for our guidance we're going with 30%. Now, it's true that a very high percentage of our income is in the U.S., so we're as interested as any of the rest of you are on what's going to happen to tax rates in the U.S. Operating cash flow is up 15% from last year. We're saying operating cash flow would come in at $1.150 billion, up from $1 billion last year. And our Q1 guidance is $1.92 to $2 a share, only an $0.08 spread in there, and the reason for that is, of course, we're into the quarter already, so we have a pretty good view about that. For the full year, we've established a $0.40 variance at $8.82 to $9.22 with the midpoint of $9.02. You should know that, in the first quarter, Deltek was seasonally soft in the first quarter, just how their business is and then up dramatically in the second quarter and so they do have a little seasonality in the way the incoming renewals and new business gets generated. If we look then to the next slide, we can kind of summarize kind of how the year wound up and how we're positioned for this current year. As we said, we had record results for orders and revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash. Really significant milestones. In the fourth quarter, it's the first time we've ever had $1 billion in quarterly revenue and of course you can see from our guidance it's going to be more of the norm in the future. Of over $1.5 billion in backlog versus $1.07 billion the last year, so we're up about $508 million in backlog going into the year. We have $1 billion in operating cash flow for the first time. Now we look back at what we said at the beginning of last year, our guidance was, we can do about $1 billion and we actually did a little over $1 billion for the first time. Really a transformational year for us on many levels. We invested $3.7 billion in software acquisitions this year after $1.8 billion the year before. And half of our EBITDA in 2017 is going to come from our Software and Network businesses and the other half from products, some of those are medical products. We're looking for about 20% revenue growth in 2017. We have really broad based opportunities. It's a better situation for us as we enter 2017 because the macroeconomic drivers fit our businesses really well. That headwind that we've had to bite through over a $265 million dividend in the Energy is gone. And the end markets we see are much more optimistic and our business leaders were sort of 80% through our 2017 review process with the field and the optimism is pretty good, maybe even better than what we're willing to endorse yet. We're going to continue to expand and compound our cash flow, and I think being up 15% cash flow in 2017 over 2016, and a business that's basically not cyclical anymore, is a pretty good achievement. So we've got great results and very, very strong exciting momentum as we go into 2017 and beyond. And with that, Rob, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. And we'll go to Scott Davis with Barclays.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Hey, good morning, Scott.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And thanks for moving to cash earnings. It's what all the rest of our companies do, so it just makes a little easier for everybody, for us at least. So thanks for that. I just kind of just curious to hear, Brian, your opinion on why you think orders came snapping back in the quarter to kind of when you think about Medical and Scientific Imaging? I mean is this a bit of a post – post election people are holding off on stuff and then it came through or is there some legitimate recovery views out there, I mean just kind of curious to see how you think about that?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: I don't think it's anything related to post-election activity or people holding up because of where the orders are, right? So, you didn't have a negative dip in orders in Industrial or Energy, so that helps at the beginning, right?
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: And then, you had an unusual situation with a large book boarded for (25:07) the tunnel project. If you took that out, then organic orders are more or like 6% or something like that...
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: ...I think that the improvement in Medical was pretty good. The people think about the Sunquest lab business, but it's actually the Acute Care Software business and it's doing really well, it's just that the lab business has been on the laggard for the last two years organically even though it's continued to be improve, but the ancillary things around it are growing at double-digits. So, they are getting bigger and their growth is organic and it comes in and you see stronger support. Same thing, we went through a little bit of a hiccup in MHA at the beginning of 2016, and we're constantly monitoring drug issues and pricing and what's happening with generics, and what's happening with the things we serve, which are not the big risk drug things. So, MHA is improving a bit, but the two software components that go into home health and alternate site treatment for people are performing exceptionally well. Again, these are sort of double-digit growers. So, I think that's good and then we had – generally our CBORD business does really well in Q2, and that's most of the year, but it had pretty good Q4. There is a level of optimism. Throughout our reviews that we do each business, a year ago, people were really apprehensive and nervous and you don't get that from anybody. So, I think as Rob and myself, and John and Paul put these numbers together for the year, our governance model creates what you see in the way of guidance. Maybe there will be some better euphoria throughout the year, but we're not banking on it.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Very fair. And then did Roper Pumps actually turn positive on orders year-over-year, or is it still year-over-year negative?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: It was down, I can tell you it was actually up 8% in revenue sequentially...
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: ...in the fourth quarter over the third quarter, but the – not the orders, but the revenue, so...
John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.: (27:22) But no, Roper Pump is still negative on orders and revenue in the fourth quarter, but sequentially a little bit better, but year-over-year it's still a headwind.
Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, okay. Well, I've got follow-up to you guys afterwards, but thank you, and good luck.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: All right.
Operator: We'll go next to Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning, guys.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Hey, good morning, Shannon.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. Brian, just on the deferred revenue. One, is that, I think I haven't seen it presented that way before in your working capital slide. Is that sort of a redefinition of the metric internally too, or are you just showing it differently to us? And is that going to be the main driver of the improvement in working capital from here, receivables and payables kind of reached a natural stopping point and the deferred revenue is going to be the driver from here, maybe just some thoughts on that?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. As far as the reporting convention, it's always been in our number. So this is not a change. We've decided to split it away from the payables and accruals line in order to show the increase in that deferred revenue side. I mean, look, there is always more opportunity on all these line items, right, whether it's receivables or inventory or payables. But I do think most of the future improvement will continue to be the growth that we see in software and we get paid in advance for that. And so that continues to build the deferred revenue balance. I anticipate that's where we'll see most of the incremental change. Of course the change in the first quarter will be substantial, because we'll be able to roll in a full quarter of deferred revenue for ConstructConnect and Deltek in addition to their revenue.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, thanks. And then in terms of the Medical segment, you feel like that's getting to a point where it can now grow like 5% plus on a consistent basis, or is there – is the nature of kind of the Imaging business as well as some of the pieces of the Medical businesses, is it such that we're going to kind of average the mid single-digits, but we're going to go through these periods of low-singles and high-singles? Maybe just some thoughts around the steadiness or lack thereof of the whole segment in total.
Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Sure, Shannon. So really this is the 12th consecutive quarter that the Medical businesses have been up mid single-digits or better organically. So really the noise in the segment has been with the Imaging businesses. As we mentioned, this quarter the Imaging business is down, so the segment was only up 3%, but the core Medical businesses have been consistently mid-single-digit growers now for three years, and we certainly expect that to continue.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: We'll go next to Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks, good morning.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Good morning.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hey. I'm just wondering on the Energy segment with I think some of (30:25) stronger than you expected probably and the orders were good. Is that proving a little earlier cycle than you might have expected, the sensitivity?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: No, I don't. All you can see is that the rate of decline improved. It was still down year-over-year except for those orders. So, I think we think it's going to be flat to low single-digit growth in 2017. But of the businesses we have that were involved in it, we really only see one of them that still has headwinds going into 2017, and that's our compressor control business which has – it has a lot of service content, but on the new applications, it still has to struggle quite a bit. And you had rig counts were up a little bit, so that you get a little bit of improvement at Roper Pump, but it's not – the materiality of Energy in 2017 is it won't be a headwind.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Sure. And then the corporate unallocated line looks like it had a lot of deal expenses in the first quarter. What's the outlook for that line for next year, and does the first quarter include some carryover from the heavy processes that you executed in the fourth quarter?
John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.: I don't expect there would be any carryover. Remember, we did adjust out the substantial by acquisition expenses in the fourth quarter for both Deltek and ConstructConnect. And so what you see there as far as the variance on a year-over-year basis is, frankly, our stock price is higher, and so our equity compensation expense is higher as a result. We expect that to be somewhere in the range of $140 million, the total for the corporate G&A line, about $140 million for 2017, reflecting the increase in equity compensation primarily.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Got it. Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next to Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Hey, good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, you guys disappointed, you're missing all the fun snowstorm in the Northeast today?
John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Terribly disappointed. We got four inches of sunshine this morning here in Florida. So...
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: All right.
John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Sorry.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great job. Maybe we could talk about the first quarter. The guide looks a little bit light. Give us an update how the quarter is tracking versus the year organic, 3% to 5%, and is there anything unusual in timing? You called out Deltek seasonally weak. Is there anything else you'd highlight?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Well, I think that just because it is historically a little light in the first quarter, and now it's really strong in the second quarter, the rest of the year. So I think organic is, Q1 and Q4 would be 3% to 4%, and Q2 and Q3 would be 4% to 5% or 6% or something like that. So, for the year, we're like 3% to 5% with maybe a little hope for upside.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And then, it was interesting you called out that your mix today is 50% in software and network businesses. What do you see as the optimal mix for Roper over time?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Well, I think, our focus would be to continue to compound the cash, right. So, the more we can grow in software and network businesses, the happier we are, because they just inherently are going to throw off more cash that we can reinvest for further compounding in the future than the products businesses. But our products businesses are about half of the EBITDA. Now a chunk of that, a notable chunk of that, is our medical products businesses. And then you've got the instrumentation businesses and you've got the oil and gas related stuff. We may enjoy a little bit of a cyclical spike on oil and gas, but it won't materially affect the balance of the company's EBITDA profile. Our businesses, as I said, you just look at the OP alone in the fourth quarter between Energy and Industrial is 30.5%. So we love the businesses. They are positive cash. They don't have much amortization in them, but moving the needle on compounding cash will come from software and networks.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And just one last clarification. I know you're not factoring in any of the potential changes in corporate tax. But for your medical products, are you considering any uncertainty in terms of ordering with uncertainty around the repeal or changes in the Affordable Care Act in terms of the outlook for 2017?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I'll let Neil comment on that one.
Laurence Neil Hunn - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Good morning, Deane. So the short answer is, we're not expecting much headwind at all, just like we didn't expect much tailwind when it came in. Majority of what we do is not procedure or patient driven. It's more elements that help the totality of the healthcare system do what they do. And so we have a lot of things that were consumed in a procedure than we would have been benefited and might have some headwinds, but that's not the nature of what we do.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, good morning.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Hey, good morning.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: On albeit the Trump stuff, I'm sure you guys have done a little bit of analysis. You got, obviously, had kind of a bunch of different subsidiaries that kind of roll up into the total. So it's hard for us to tell, but you do have a lot of U.S. related revenue. So what kind of impact would it have on your tax rate, if you did have kind of a lowering to that 15% to 20% range? And then, I think exports are like 13%ish of your revenues. Is there a material import component that offsets that? It's the first question.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: So let's deal with the border tax side first. There is not much. There we do have some assembly operations in Mexico that we get subcomponents from, for one, two of our businesses. But it's not a lot. Most of our international businesses are selling globally and our domestic businesses don't export. I mean, they're really not domestic business, they're global businesses. The locus might be here in the U.S., but they have manufacturing operations outside the U.S. So and then – and they could ship for many of them. So I don't think the border tax would be a lot. We did sort of a back of the napkin kind of assessment about that would be. Probably 75% to 80% of our operating profit will be generated in the United States. So, if we're telling you about 30% blended tax rate, the U.S. tax rate of course is 35% and above, so you can kind of do the math on our net earnings number and look at 80% of it and then take a 20% reduction of that or a 10% reduction or whatever you think and then add back the increased cost of the border tax and net-net it would be quite a material increase in our cash.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right, right.
John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.: And some of that (38:11) Steve, of course, there is no proposal yet.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah, yeah.
John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Right. So..
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: No. There is a lots of...
John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.: As soon as we see a proposal, we can give you a much better answer, but the elements of exactly whatever tax change all this is headlines in the newspaper so far.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah, and Twitter feeds or whatever, your handles or whatever you call them. On the infrastructure side kind of same question, I guess sort of the same topic. Assuming – if they do something, I would assume that the kind of the tolling business would perhaps be exposed there with any other businesses there, they will be positively exposed to any of this infrastructure discussion that's out there. Again, there is no official proposal, but assuming they do spend on some of the roads and bridges and things like that.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Well, I think that all of our professional services businesses, including these last two acquisitions; ConstructConnect...
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right, right.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: ...and Deltek could be dramatically benefited by the number of seats and the number of users that would want to get access to those technologies, particularly at Deltek with the Costpoint technology, which is ubiquitous for people that supply the government and that would be very helpful. In the tolling area, it's interesting. There is actually – we've gone through this huge technology transformation to our sticker tags away from what other people get stuck with with the plastic box from Austria. And that had a huge roll out in all of the big tolling stage. And so that's sort of behind us, that roll out, so you just have the maintenance, the maintenance is huge. The number of reorders, we're always amazed where will all these tags go. So it's good, but the project growth in infrastructure could well be in our trans-suite software and traffic management arena, that's really what the Saudi project is. And the electronic tolling project in New York, for instance, doesn't have – it's all electronic, so there is no tags on it.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: So it would definitely help us, particularly in revenue, probably not help us as much as it would have historically in the margin where people are also using the tags, but that's – it would be favorable to us. And then I think if you get – you got the various elements that appear to be going through that would get us back into production around shale, we came down to $165 million in two years in Energy and Industrial. We won't go back up to $165 million, but we won't be going down, we might go up more than we think. So that's a little bit of a question mark for us.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right. One more question just on the first quarter following up to Deane's question. The 3% to 4% organic is solid. I guess their earnings number is a little bit below what I would have expected. So is there anything that kind of that you travel from the top-line to the bottom-line, whether it's acquisition charges that you know maybe people won't have in their models or mix dynamics. And anything there, corporate, that we have to keep in mind for the first quarter that stands out?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Well, I think you just have the situation around, we got all the interest cost in Q1 for Deltek and its contribution doesn't come in as much until Q2 and beyond.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: So it's kind of tiny, right? But, in reality, first quarter guidance is about 22% of the full year guidance, and that's not that unusual. You would be aware that Q1 was 25% of the full year, right.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: So I think it's just an out of the box situation. And Q2 will be incredible for us.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes. Okay. Well, it's helpful, you guys give, a lot of companies don't give the quarterly guidance. So it's helpful to level set people and get everybody on the same page. So I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question is from Robert McCarthy with Stifel.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Robert.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Obviously, you've just completed two very large deals, transformative debatably and you are digesting that. But maybe can you just talk about, maybe over the next three years to four years, what is your M&A outlook fire power? How are you thinking about it? How we should be thinking about it? Because, as you know, money never sleeps. And so, as good as what you've just done over the last four months, and the changes you've made to your reporting structure, clearly, investors remain focused on the continued compound nature of the company.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: So the – a few years ago, people would remember, I said we already know the next $5 billion we want to deploy, it's just a question of when it happens. So we've done that all and we've (43:28) really got these things. The good news is we still know where the next $5 billion deployment needs to be and they are, and when they are ready to be assimilated. So, I think over the – if you look at 2017, 2018 and 2019, I would think we deploy about $4 billion, just not much of it in 2017, where we want to pay back existing debt to EBITDA unless there is some other source of cash that comes up that we haven't talked about. We're looking to pay down that debt level by $700 million or more, and that still gives us room for bolt-on for this year and then much larger acquisitions in 2018 and 2019 and the compounded cash is coming up and we self-generated the ability to do $1.5 billion a year. We just want to get our debt holders comfortable as this year unfolds.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Now, as you look at it, and this is a question that might be a little bit more for broader application than Roper. But, Brian, since you've been doing deals for a very long time and you historically worked at companies which maybe you had higher fixed cost assets and drove a lot of value through cost takeout. How do you look at the environment right now? If you're an acquirer and it's unclear given border adjustability and other issues, how you're going to get the cost synergies to kind of de-lever what could be ostensibly a high multiple, lower multiples? Now that's not your game anymore I understand, but I wanted to just get your view, do you think it creates a tougher cloud to your M&A environment for the standard acquirer, strategic acquirer in the Industrial space or how would you look at the M&A environment as being kind of from your perch?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Well, fortunately...
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: We look at it differently than hypothesis therein from our perch. If we look at M&A just sort of as a category of activity, the big question is, is interest going to be deductible in some kind of change in U.S. tax. So, if interest isn't going to be deductible, you can imagine what are the effects that has on private equity as we're thinking about what sort of multiples are going to put to work. So, if you're accustomed to putting seven times and eight times debt-to-EBITDA and getting a tax deduction for that, that gives you massive ability to compete with strategics. If you lose the interest deduction, your ability to compete with strategics goes down. If you remove one of the biggest acquirer of entities from the market, the strategics should have a field day. Now, that said, most of the multi industry people have very complicated import/export arrangement. So, I would imagine that they got a lot of issues with the border tax, painfully we don't. I think the M&A environment for us, as interest rates go up irrespective of whether you can deduct the interest, as interest rates go up, we're in a better position with each passing month that occurs because we have so much self-generated free cash flow. And if we do acquisitions with our own cash flow and lever of about three times debt-to-EBITDA, which is our model, we wind up with purchase powder requiring very little, if any, new debt of about $1.5 billion a year. And that's why I'm very comfortable saying I think over the next three years or a month or two beyond that we'll deploy $4 billion as it's easy for us. We're going to do it in acquiring things that are going to compound their cash. And so we keep getting more cash to reinvest as opposed to having to do big debt structures. So that'd be my best answer.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for the color. Appreciate it very much.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: We'll go to Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys, how are you doing?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Joe.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Going back to TransCore, just curious, obviously, in the infrastructure package from the federal government be positive, but what are you seeing out there just in terms of things that have passed that like the state and local level already, and there is some big packages in California, Washington state looks like California DOT is set to increase their budget if they get their legislation passed. So, just curious what that forward kind of outlook is there as well?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: There is a lot of bid activity and there is a lot of sweat equity that goes into things. I mean we sell the Title 21 tags into California. I mean, I mean I would do (48:01) the Bay Bridge. We had various other traffic projects that are currently under quote. But I wouldn't say that we have seen – we've seen a big increase in the last two years in terms of quotations and project opportunities. But we haven't seen something in the last two months that – it's a big deal. I think that we'd want to be careful that, if you look at total transportation spending, the tolling and traffic side is not a big percentage of that total, right. But nonetheless, if it goes up, there is more money available, we'll get more growth than we have now.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: And then, shifting over to Neptune, we haven't really spoken much about that. What kind of – what do you see in commentary on just the muni sector in general and levels of spending there? I think there has been a little bit of a mix signal so far from people in that space across the last couple months. So just curious what you're seeing there.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Well, we haven't seen any fall-off at all in Neptune. It's probably going to grow at mid single-digits in 2017, and it continues to have good cash performance. So there's a little bit of headwind for people that don't, aren't vertically integrated like we are around copper pricing. So, I think our competitors'll probably struggle more than we will. We're in good shape.
John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.: (49:27) that water utilities are generally self-contained, in terms of, they charge for water. And they use that revenue in order to basically maintain the system. And so, it's generally not been subject to the larger swings and municipal budget spending, it's generally its own little P&L inside the municipal world.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah. Absolutely. And just last one for me on M&A. You said that you already know, laid out the map of where you want to spend your next $5 billion, it's just a question of when they pop free. Now, given like where you guys are right now financially, if one of those larger ones was to pop free soon, would the leverage today preclude you from doing something like that, or would you consider equity if it was something sooner?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: I think that would just always be related to the quality of what it was that we saw. And the things that we are sort of hoping to acquire over the next three years, none of them are available today at noon, so it's not in a situation that we have to really be bothered with. But, we continue to monitor everything and have routine conversations. If you get the share price up here to what it's really worth given all this cash, a consideration, I suppose, but I wouldn't issue equity today.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Sure. Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: We'll go to Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes. Good morning.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Hey.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Brian, when you look at the current portfolio of businesses at Roper, how do you think about core incremental margins on the current businesses? I would think with as much software as you have, the core incremental must be – is it 45%-ish? And then it strikes me that given the Energy business is on a bounce, now, again we're not expecting that in 2017, but I remember the decrementals there have been reasonably high. So, would you look at the current business and kind of step up into that core incremental EBIT potential of 45%, and is that a fair assumption here?
John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.: So, I think the way to think about this is it depends on where it comes from, Rick. I mean, you're absolutely right. To the extent that we have more growth from the software businesses, that will come in at 50%, maybe even above that. Across the enterprise, I think what you will see is that we'll have somewhere between 35% and 50% to 55% incrementals depending on where it comes from. And I would say that the decrementals that we saw on the Energy side, they may be (52:28) high relative to others, but they were actually low relative to our gross margin, right. So, we still de-levered at a rate below our gross margins. (52:38) We're able to take the cost out ahead of just what the decline in revenue would have resulted in. Thus, we think that we did a nice job, I think our businesses did a nice job on the decremental side there. Even though it's a probably higher number than most other companies, but that's a margin discussion rather than a (52:57) discussion.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: But that's – maybe that's the point, that obviously taking the cost out on the way down, kind of managing the decremental does potentially give you more upside as you lever off of that cost base. Is pricing – and again, I would think in the current portfolio, do you have a price capture number for 2016 and has that...
John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.: No.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Has your pricing flexibility, though, improved with this portfolio as well?
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: No. We don't have standard products, right? We're an application oriented company, so you don't call up and order the same thing you bought last year. You might have recurring revenue, there may be some built-in maintenance fees associated with batter and SaaS. There may be some annual escalation. But, we're not a product company with standard products. Even the products that we have are pretty unique products and so they don't tend to have a standard price list that people can work off of. There is a few exceptions to that, but not many.
John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.: And the other thing that with – and what we do look up with respect to price is really what's the value capture that we're able to get inside the niche markets and applications that we have. If you just look at the Industrial Technology segment by itself, the gross profit margin I think is the thing to look at when you think about value and price and cost and things like that. And our Industrial Technology business is actually a 50.6% gross margin in 2016, up 80 basis points from where it was in 2015. Energy Systems & Controls still clicking along at 57% gross profit margin. So, I mean folks who try to say price as a discrete measure, just follow their gross margin and see if any of that price really shows up there, that's how we think about it rather than having standard price list and what a nominal price change might be advertised at. The proof is in the gross profit margin.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, John, just one last question. As we move forward into 2017 here with really more of a cash earnings number, is it the intent to report EBITA by segment or will we continue to report a GAAP profit by segment and then add the amortization kind of consolidated?
John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.: I think what you'll see us do is move to a segment profit description, which would add back the non-cash purchase accounting related amortization in order to be able to have the same comparability for all the same reasons at the total.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to John Quealy with Canaccord.
John Salvatore Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. First question on Deltek. In that, RF & Software guidance, would Deltek be right in line with that mid single-digit organic growth or perhaps are they a little bit more in the cash flow side, so perhaps a little bit less organic growth, but better cash flow margins vis-à-vis its peers in that segment?
John Humphrey - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. So, of course, Deltek is not included in our organic results or forecast for 2017, that will all be acquisition-related. On an apples-to-apples basis, for sure we have to take what their prior results were in the – with a little bit of grayness of salt. But, we expect that we are a mid single-digit grower. I think they're reporting something a little bit higher than that, but we expect mid single-digit organic growth on a long-term basis out of that acquisition.
John Salvatore Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, quickly, lastly much more speculative question, but if the tax structure changes, and I know you guys are loathed to sell major assets, given low tax basis. But, would you consider given the right tax regime, letting go some bigger assets perhaps on the fixed cost side? I'm thinking Neptune, for example, as a core asset given the market seems to be giving these types of water companies good multiples. Would you consider selling a bigger asset if the cash return would look more promising? Thanks, guys.
Brian D. Jellison - Roper Technologies, Inc.: No. We'd expect the market is smart enough, we believe it is to get the value for us – for Neptune being worth more than any of the other water companies, it's imputed in our price. There could be other businesses we have that are different. Neptune is very different. We're going to move that increasingly into technology and all kinds of exciting things going on there, which we're not going to talk about openly until it's too late for people to respond. But, I will say, when you look at some of the deeper product businesses, the legacy product businesses or some of the instrumentation businesses, you can see something happen there, but people would have to basically pay our tax. So, if the tax burden goes down to the acquirer then, hey, maybe there are more areas, I don't know.
John Salvatore Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you, guys.
Operator: That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to Robert Crisci for closing remarks.
Rob Crisci - Roper Technologies, Inc.: Well, thank you again everyone for joining us and we look forward to speaking to you in a few months.
Operator: That will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2016 Q3  (2016-10-31 08:30:00) =====
Executives: John Humphrey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Brian Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Rob Crisci - Vice President, Investor Relations
Analysts: Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets Robert McCarthy - Stifel Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company Brian Gesuale - Raymond James & Associates Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird
Operator: The Roper Technologies' Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. Today's conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Rob Crisci, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Rob Crisci: Thank you, Audra, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the third quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Humphrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Paul Soni, our Vice President and Controller. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call which are available through the webcast or also available on our Web site. Now if you will please turn to slide two. We begin with our Safe Harbor statements. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in on our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our Web site. For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of two items. First, a $2.2 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized, if not for our acquisition. Second, $0.9 million debt extinguishment charge related to the replacement of our former credit facility with a new $2.5 billion facility that closed in the quarter. And now, if you will please turn to Slide 4, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everybody. We will start here with the Q3 enterprise results, so next Slide. We had a record for just about everything again in the third quarter. Our orders were an all-time record at $929 million, and by the way if we had booked the MTA order couple of days earlier but it wasn’t quite ready to go, we would have been -- we would have had our first $1 billion order quarter in our history. Revenue was strong. Net earnings were, of course, a record EBITDA cash flow. Revenue was up 7% to $947 million, which gave us 2 points of organic growth despite the headwinds in oil and gas. FX costs us 1 point, and then acquisitions and divestitures netted out plus 6% because this was still the last quarter without all the divestment in. Growth was led by both the medical and RF technologies, software businesses and certainly Neptune. We had an outstanding quarter, you will see in a minute. Declines in oil and gas were basically about what we thought. We thought they would be sort of down 20% or so and they were. Gross margins were up 60 basis points to 61.3 and EBITDA was up 8% to $328 million. Our net earnings reached $169 million, which gave us a DEPS earnings per share number of $1.65 ahead of our guidance. Free cash flow was up 40%, really an astonishing quarter, where free cash flow was up 11% year-to-date but up 40% in the third quarter. And then our ConstructConnect acquisition, which we are announcing today, and which will close this week is another terrific business for us. It's a SaaS network business for the pre-construction industry, and we will detail that later in the call this morning, and it should close yet this week. So we had very strong cash quarter. We had record results and then we had this pre-acquisition. So the next Slide. Here if you look at the income statement, you can see orders were up 4%. The book to bill was 0.98, which is okay because of lumpy activity. It's in the wheelhouse but had we been able to book the MTA order, our book to bill would have been 1.05, which would give you just some idea about how strong really the core orders were. The only thing in the quarter that was odd is the normal fourth quarter delivery schedule stuff was not very strong. Revenue was up 7%. Our gross profit was up 8%. You can see we are up 60 basis points in gross profit. The operating income margin because of the acquisition and amortization in these things, you can see it going to 28.5%, which is still spectacular but down 20 basis points. The reality is, on the next Slide you will see the EBITA margin actually went up 30 basis points, which is the right way to look at a cash oriented business like ours. And then net earnings were up 4%. Tax rate at about what we thought. Next Slide. If you compare the operating and the EBITA margins, we certainly have not reported leading first with those kind of numbers, but our EBITDA margins, you can see in 2014's third quarter were 32.5%, last year at 33.4% and this year at 33.7%. So our margins on the operating cash side are up 120 basis points in just two years, and our gross margins continue up as well. If focusing on the operating profit margin where you get a lot of non-cash amortization charges which lead people to the wrong conclusion, it's the wrong way to think about a cash business like ours even though the results are outstanding. So we are really focused on continuing to improve our EBITA margins which were up 30 basis points. Next Slide. We continue to comp out cash flow at a quite strong clip and we don’t see that slowing down any time soon. We really have a terrific operating cash flow in the quarter, $317 million, both operating and free cash flow were up 40% and you can see the comparison to last year at $660 million, year-to-date operating cash flow, and now we are at $731 million, up 11% despite less than robust end markets in our industrial and energy businesses. Conversion was pretty spectacular, you can see our year-to-date conversion on operating cash flow was 146%. So excellent cash performance. Next Slide. Our asset-light business model which five years ago people told me you couldn’t make it any better than it was, continues to improve at really phenomenal rates. Here you can see inventories down 80 basis from two years ago, receivables are down 150 basis points, and payables and accruals are actually up 160 basis points. So, two years ago we had 5.8% net working capital to revenue in the way we measure it. Today, we closed the quarter at 1.9%, that’s a 67% reduction as a function of revenue in just two years, 390 basis points. So the quality of the asset-light acquisitions that we have been doing the last couple of years in addition to our own governance process around improving everything we own, is really having just astonishing impact on our ability to compound cash and deploy future capital. Next Slide. If you look here at the financial position of the company, you get some sense of the balance sheet. Just as a quick note, this is absolutely the biggest balance sheet that we have ever had to capture capital employment opportunities. We now have an undrawn revolver of $2.5 billion, and we have $882 million of cash, so nearly $3.4 billion of powder, and even after paying for the ConstructConnect business, our acquisition powder is right around $2.8 billion. We have deployed capital since January 1 of 2015 at a rate of $2.7 billion during that 21-month period. So our compounding of the cash and the strength of the balance sheet and the flexibility that our new credit facility gives us, is all great because we are going to be able to put that to good use with an incredible acquisition pipeline that we continue to see. And you can see our net debt to EBITDA number is only 1.7. After the acquisition it's still just around 2. So we’ve got a lot of ramp space here to be able to continue to make transactions that are accretive to the company. Next Slide. We will look at the segment detail of each of the four segments the way we had reported and then talk about the detail of the business here after that. So the next Slide. Here if we look at the Q3 segment performance of energy, you can see it's EBITDA margin was 29%, industrial tech 32%. The first point about thinking around these businesses is how remarkable there margin performance is in these challenging markets. The nimble execution that we have inside the presidents to run those businesses is really amazing. In 2003 those businesses, the industry and industrial businesses taken together, had about $377 million in revenue and this year taken together they had $303 million. And yet the EBITDA margin in '14 was 32% of those combined businesses and here this year it's 31%. So despite a significant fall off in revenue, the margins have been able to maintained. The second point of the Slide is that of course our future and nature of the enterprise you can see, continues to compound towards the RF, the application software, the medical software and the medical products businesses which now make up nearly 75% of the EBITDA of Roper's entire entity. And they also have done remarkably well. Two years ago those businesses had about 39% EBITDA, today those businesses have about 41% EBITDA. We look at the first, in our controls and energy systems now is down to barely 10% of the company, and its organic growth was down 13%, generally the way we thought it would be. The segment while down as expected really did modestly better than it did in the second quarter and is likely to do modestly better again in the fourth quarter. Terrific profitability. You know the OP margins in this segment in the third quarter were 25.4% and the EBITDA margins were 29.2%. When we look at the fourth quarter, we think oil and gas will be down about another 20% in this particular segment, same as it was in the third quarter but we don’t think we are going to get much growth in terms of fourth quarter seasonality. We didn’t get much last year but generally it's been quite substantial. So we are sort of assuming that we won't get that this year. Margins will improve again in the fourth quarter. You know we started the year out in energy with 20.4% OP. Second quarter went to 22.5%, the third quarter is already up to 25.4% and the fourth quarter will be substantially materially above that. So these businesses still in our view represent sort of a free shot on goal for us and the only represent 10% or less of revenue. Next Slide. On the industrial technology side, you can see that this is the, fortunately, the last quarter. We will talk about this divestiture of ABEL. If you adjust for the divestiture, the segment was actually flat despite the upstream oil and gas piece that’s in industrial technology being down 35%. So how did that happen? Well, it happened from double-digit growth at Neptune who continues to gain market share and very strong demand for the R900 automatic meter reading and AMI technology with lots of migrating upgrades. We had a significant number of wins last quarter, over ten. And really the $50 million that we put into R&D in the last three years at Neptune has gotten us into a very outstanding position that people will begin to appreciate just how much we have done and how far advanced we are going to be over the next couple of years in this space. We did get some sequential improvement at Roper Pumps and that we expect to have a little bit better results again in the fourth quarter despite the basically that two other businesses in here that are really purely related upstream and have been severely hampered. The rest of our businesses in here, it's kind of test businesses, are all doing relatively well. Some of them actually have record quarters and on balance we don’t see any deterioration in those businesses. In the fourth quarter we think we will have sort of similar revenue and margin performance to what we had in the third quarter. And while upstream markets are sequentially flat, there is a tiny bit of improvement that we are seeing. Next Slide. Here we look at the RF technology and software segment. It's really increasingly right to think about three legs in this segment with the RF product side of activity and then you have the tolling side of activity and then you have all this applications software business and of course now in addition to that with ConstructConnect. So here the businesses revenue was up 20% in the quarter, the operating profit was up 26%. The OP margin is 31.7% but the EBITDA margin was 38%, up 230 basis points. We had organic growth of 7% in the segment and had about one point of foreign exchange headwind and acquisitions helped by 14%. Very strong growth at toll and traffic on project activity in Florida and Texas, Pennsylvania. Sounds like swing states in the election. Continues high single digit growth in software led by freight matching and CBORD. We did some really exciting things at freight matching. We moved to a more modern software-friendly location in the Portland, Oregon area and that we have put together the freight matching networks of DAT in the U.S. and get loaded into a new software development. A process that’s going to expand our customer base. We had double digit growth in the RF products business. Lot of that’s driven by senior living. There are several of our businesses that touch senior living. And then toll and traffic would have had spectacular orders, of course, if we would have been able to book the bridge and toll project -- toll and tunnel project which we hoped would happen a little bit earlier in the year. We had a five year extension of our toll mandate in Dubai and the Saudi project sort of back on track. We wound up with our about 30 installations here in the fourth quarter we think which will get us to about 70 of the 350. So we feel much better about the progress in Riyadh. In the fourth quarter, TransCore was awarded the $70 million plus MTA project to convert nine bridges and tunnel around five boroughs. All of you who go back and forth in that are well aware of what that’s like in others, like 800,000 people a day going through that process. And conversion with our Infinity technology will people to not have toll booths and there will be fines, of course based on video tolling. But if you have a normal toll tag you will be able to get through. The growth in toll and traffic we think will continue to manifest itself in the fourth quarter and certainly into 2017. The software business universally remains strong. We had kind of mid-single digit organic growth in the whole segment which gives really strong momentum going into '17, certainly the best position that we have had in the segment in a long time. And now we have acquired ConstructConnect which we will talk about here in a second, for $632 million. It's got about $150 million in revenue and sort of Roper type expected EBITDA margins which will get better as it gets inside the Roper to govern its process. Next Slide. So talking about ConstructConnect for a minute. We issued a separate press release on this. I think today is an interesting day in addition to being a record quarter, it's a record number of press releases. This is really an amazing business. When our teams made the trips and the diligence process, and working with Dave Conway's staff, you get to work in their training center and you can watch the network live. It's really -- it’s just like watching the floor of the exchange with all this activity going, you realize how many people are interacting with this thing. They have $55 billion of bid activity. It's just remarkable. It's like our freight matching network where something is up for maybe 1, 1.2 seconds, before it's grabbed by somebody else in the network and here you are seeing all this usage around the data which is just unprecedented that is inside the network that’s accessible to everybody. So it's all cloud-based technology. The network allows people to see what projects are coming up. They can see what contractors, form their own opinions about who might be competing for it, what the call up is for everyone's specifications. There are also going to be benefitted by the way because they will work together with our On Center business that was just dry wall construction only. And their own niche things that are going to be able to fold into ConstructConnect going forward. Those 800,000 users were laughing about this -- in preparation of the call, basically there is 800,000 people that use the bridge and tunnels in New York every day. So we have decided to, perhaps every person going through the tunnel represents the ConstructConnect user. This business is headquartered in Cincinnati. It's revenue for next year should be something, hopefully about $150 million. It's got to generate something in the $50 million plus of EBITDA to us and remember lots of non-cash amortization in these things. So terrific cash business. It will meet all of our acquisition requirements. It's got a great management team. Dave's been running this business through its acquisition phase and through its evolutionary shaping of the preconstruction industry. So he really is the domain expert. Very high recurring revenue. It's a subscription business. So you have all those great cash characteristics. It has deferred revenue so have very few assets of any kind, and it really has multiple growth opportunities. And that’s another reason why we have found it to be a very attractive acquisition. I think a great home for ConstructConnect who can now focus really on continuing to shape the evolution of the pre-construction industry. Next Slide. The medical and scientific imaging business. You can see here we were up 12%. 8% on acquisition, 4% on organic. A little less than one point of negative FX but around its down as opposed to up. The medical businesses are 85% of this segment and they grew organically at 5% and interestingly throughout the year, the medical businesses have grown organically at 5%. Each one of the separate businesses are sort of hospital software or alternate type solutions business and the medical products, all three groups grew. Sunquest, the way we look at order intake is surely different than bookings against the entire business because there are so much recurring revenue that doesn’t really change from a bookings space. But on an order intake basis, they had a record and the third quarter was up by the most it's ever been. Scientific imaging was about 15% of the segment. It did okay in the third quarter. It had modest growth but actually it's a bifurcated situation where the life science portion, because of cryo-EM market opportunities, grew over 100% in the quarter, while the physical science business continued to be pretty weak and was down about 20%. So the opportunity in front of these businesses is best it's ever been. In the fourth quarter, we think we will have continued mid-single digit growth for the medical businesses, led really by the Alternate Site Solutions business. Scientific Imaging we think will be terrific on demand and bookings for new products but most of those probably will have early 2017 deliveries, which is another reason that you maybe get some here in the fourth quarter, we would just have to see, but we are going to assume that mostly that’s going to be the first half of next year. Okay. The next Slide is the guidance update. Turning to page, here is the specifics on the guidance. We are going to go in -- for the fourth quarter we had $1.77 to $1.89. It's a broad range, probably not really a broad range given how much money we make and how few shares we have. So seasonality in the industrial and energy business is not something that we think will help this year. We could be wrong about that and if get normal seasonality, then we will towards the higher end of the range. The New York City MTA ramp is very important in the fourth quarter. There was a commitment to get the first three projects completed by January 1 and how that project ramps will have a direct effect on whether we are towards the low or the higher end of the guidance. And then customer preferences around delivery. We talk of third quarter orders were satisfactory but not carrying immediate delivery kind of results. So I think there is some hesitancy in the industrial and energy markets about exactly when they want things that they are booked and committed to. The full year guidance, given the fourth quarter addition to our year-to-date results, would give us somewhere around $648 million to $660 million. Most of our internal projections and external projections are on around $655 million to $660 million. Full year cash flow conversions would still be spectacular, 140% or so. And that will allow us despite terrific oil and gas headwinds this year to have 5% to 6% revenue and EBITDA growth for the year. Next Slide. If we look at the summary of how we did in the third quarter, it's kind of a long list of good things. We got record orders, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow. Four standout businesses there. Medical software, tolling and Neptune were really quite good. Because, remember, we got 20 plus negative on the energy side of the business. EBITDA got up to 34.6% of revenue and our free cash flow was phenomenal. The New York City MTA bridge and tunnel all electronic tolling project, we really expected to win this for sometime but the news about it, the commitment around it didn’t come until last Friday. So we have been planning for a Q4 kick-off and we will do what we said we will do for them, which is get the first three projects done. But almost the vast majority of this work is going to come in 2017 and not in the fourth quarter. We acquired a great SaaS network business in ConstructConnect and it along with the things you can do with On Center in a cooperative way, will be very beneficial for us in 2017. The cash performance that we have year-to-date along with a brand new balance sheet with a much better credit facility, supports our continued ability to deploy capital. It's the most powder we have ever had and eh opportunities that we see are excellent. So we had outstanding results in the third quarter and we are very well positioned for 2017 and ready to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Deane Dray at RBC Capital.
Andrew Krill: This is Andrew Krill on for Deane. I want to start off on ConstructConnect, this is the second meaningful deal you guys have done recently in Software-as-a-Service after Aderant. So I am just wondering if you could talk about market share within construction, and if there are any unique barriers to entry versus peers for the business.
John Humphrey: Well, this is John Humphrey. So as far as barriers, I mean the barrier of course for a networks business is the strength and size of the network, and the ability for all of the different users to be able to transact business and grow their own businesses by utilizing the ConstructConnect network and software solutions. And I think it goes to the size of the network. When Brian talked about 800,000 users and 55 million invitations to bid every year encompassing almost 400,000 different commercial construction projects. I mean the size of the network and the combination that ConstructConnect has been able to put together between their different brands of iSqft, Bidclerk and Construct Data, and really turn that into a single integrated platform and that’s truly unique inside the industry. So from a competitive position. I think for most of those customers, the way that variable to grow their business and to bid on more projects and to win more, is through connection to the ConstructConnect network. And so that’s really the strength of that in the competitive position. There are a couple of competitors out there that also provide, particularly on the construction data side, but on the network and the integrated data, we really don’t think there is anyone of size there.
Andrew Krill: Okay. It is very helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. Do you have any sense of potential accretion and then I guess kind of where you guys that EBITDA margin could eventually go versus the sort of 33% or so you are expecting next year. Thank you.
John Humphrey: Well, we still have a lot of work to do. I mean we are going to close on the transaction but it is worth thinking about it as probably somewhere in the $0.10 to $0.15 accretive for next year. We will be able to update you on that of course as we finalize the purchase accounting. And the margin profile here is also very good, right.. We are talking about something that’s already in the mid-30% EBITDA margin. And so as it continues to grow, it will grow with high incremental margins. And so that’s how we see the margin progression over time as this network continues to get bigger.
Brian Jellison: I just want to add to the understanding that these acquisitions have a lot of non-cash amortization. So on a GAAP DEPS basis, people are looking at expensing that amortization and depressing what otherwise looks like earnings per share. Reality is, it will be very cash accretive. But on a GAAP DEPS basis it may only add $0.10 or $0.15. I think you get paid as a shareholder for monitoring what's happening to the quality of the cash earnings. The cash earnings of ConstructConnect will be great.
Operator: And we will move next to Robert McCarthy at Stifel.
Robert McCarthy: I guess, first, just talking about the -- again, congratulations at a very strong cash generation quarter. These questions will relate obviously to DEPS. But in terms of the medical cadence for the fourth quarter and energy, could you just expand on your comments about what kind of brought the guide down for the fourth quarter.
Brian Jellison: I think two things in terms of the DEPS. It's just our view of that is that we are not going to get much in the way of seasonality. When we look to the orders that came in the third quarter, we get a lot of footprints and we call them booked and so they are booked with a quarter, shipped within the next quarter. And we didn’t see any uptick that would give us a reason to think we would have normalized Q4 seasonality, but we could be wrong about that, that would be upside that could happen to us. So, I think it's more than any one item and then we have been ready to go on a couple of projects that we expect and we are ready to [indiscernible]. Okay.
Robert McCarthy: Energy is not particularly surprising but the medical cadence. Could you just expand upon that because I think your expectation was kind of high-single-digit growth as kind of an exit rate for fourth quarter?
John Humphrey: Yes. Rob, I think you are right about that. And once again, it goes back to what Brian was talking about. When we look at the product orders, and I am talking specifically around medical products. Well, we expected that kind of last time we talked, that’s exited closer to the 10% growth rate, that’s existing closer to the 5% growth rate, and that combined with the timing of imaging orders and deliveries. So all the life science things that Brian talked about earlier, those are actually very sophisticated instruments and cameras and filters. They aren't as kind of the -- it's not like just machining and creating a pump. So the process in order to be able to turn that from order to delivery can easily be 60, 90, 120 days depending on yield and throughput, particularly from suppliers around some of the centers. And so as we look at the deliveries and the delivery schedule, particularly on the imaging product side and also on the medical product side, that’s where we see a slight difference from what we would have thought before, but we still see this segment exiting at the mid-single-digit rate, very consistent with where it has been over the past 2.5 years.
Robert McCarthy: Okay. So you see no underlying deterioration in the core organic growth rate of that segment?
John Humphrey: No, we do not.
Brian Jellison: No, no.
Robert McCarthy: Okay. And then in terms of the M&A pipeline, obviously you have transacted on a very interesting deal this quarter. But I mean what's the state of play in terms of how you look over the next, kind of 12 to 18 months in terms of capacities of these deals and the environment to get deals done. Because it has been, in the main, kind of a difficult environment to get deals done.
Brian Jellison: Yes. You know if you go back to January '15, in that 21-month period we have deployed $2.7 billion in capital. I mean in the next 21 month period or much sooner I would think that that kind of run rates are impossible. You know we have got hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of capital to be able to put to work and getting the new $2.5 billion revolver which is [on ] [ph] done, was a big deal because it's given us some flexibility around how much we can deploy at anyone point in time and that’s very helpful. So there are a number of small deals that we are engaged with at the moment and a couple of larger transactions which would be even bigger than ConstructConnect that we are involved with, we think are very attractive. So you never know, in terms of your word, cadence, how that will happen. But I would be very very surprised if we didn’t deploy that capital in the next 12 months.
Robert McCarthy: The final question is just around, you have heard this many times, but would you consider doing something akin to what some of your competitors have done, simply not competitors but public comps, in terms of perhaps just shifting to EPS excluding amortization.
Brian Jellison: Well, there's a lot of smiling in the room because that’s the proper way to measure us. I guess we are not interested in stepping on the SEC. Those people that are doing that, they can continue to do it for a longer period of time and if the SEC doesn’t say anything about it, that’s a smart thing to do, because it's the proper way to measure the business. It's just not the way GAAP measures the earnings. So we had $50 million of amortization in the third quarter and what do we have, 101 million or 102 million of shares, you can do the math. I am apparently now allowed to say what that math generates. EBITA, earnings per share for the company will be and are spectacular.
Robert McCarthy: Brian, you would have banging my head against the wall for that for about 15 years and I am a slow learner. So I will leave it there.
Operator: We will move to our next question from Joe Giordano at Cowen and Company.
Joseph Giordano: Do you get the sense that given where rates are and when you are looking at deals, are you having to stretch a little bit more in terms of multiple because competitors who are looking at the same assets are able to kind of do some funny math with rates being here in terms of returns?
Brian Jellison: Well, I wish it were funny math but it isn't funny math. The difference is, we don't like to go above like four times debt to EBITDA, and those guys are willing to take [that staples] [ph] and banks put on things in non-bank entities, but [on times] [ph] at eight times EBITDA, right. So, they don't deploy much more equity in a transaction that we do, we just don't want to have seven or eight times debt to EBITDA. We are going to remain investment grade and to do that you want to be around four times debt to EBITDA coming back to 3 or 3.5 or something. So you know we are very disciplined about wanting to and guaranteeing ourselves to maintain investment grade status. The prices that people are paying for things are really bifurcated. Oddly enough, the industrial assets are trading at really more than they're worth in a normalized interest environment in the M&A world, because they don't have a lot of EBITDA even though they all require a lot of capital spending to maintain that EBITDA. So those multiples are interestingly high. Then the asset light business trade at a premium to that but the arbitrage for us on the asset light businesses is more favorable than those people that are buying the more capital intensive businesses. So something like ConstructConnect, it will be a long-term compounder of investment for us which is great as opposed to the guys that are buying the capital intensive businesses thinking that, gee, you know, it looks like I'm paying a lot but there is the nature of their cyclical activity and when there is this higher number, this will happen. We will leave that field to everybody else. It is not where we're going.
Joseph Giordano: Thank you. I just wanted to touch on Neptune as well. I mean the results this quarter, obviously very, very strong. There's this story out there, that has been out there for a while, fair or not, about a lack of investment. You talk about $50 million of M&A. Can you just talk about your positioning there on the highest technology type products, like on the AMI development and how you're capitalizing on your installed base? I mean the numbers speak for themselves but this has kind of been out there for a while and I guess, maybe give you guys a chance to address that.
Brian Jellison: Yes. I think $50 million was what we have done in R&D, not M&A.
Joseph Giordano: Sorry if I misspoke. Yes.
Brian Jellison: In the last three years we have put $50 million of work there. We are also opening a new software development center for Neptune that will really help us and a lot of things we're doing. So we're not going to provide a lot of information about what we're doing but I can just suggest you that we have the best reading technology that’s available and has the highest integrity results. We have an enormous installed base and maybe people forget that the way our 900 product works, we can upgrade that, the AMI status. And there is a lot of ways to collect the technology but if you have got the right core unit that can use multiple ways of gathering the data, you will be a little bit ahead of the game. So we are able to do upgrades for people in the AMI arena that they always, if they ever migrated to it, they do that and we have won a lot of those. Over $30 million of that just in the third quarter. You saw other things. Mobile activity, you see Verizon picking us as the person that they are working with development on mobile technology. So there's a lot of different things going on and we are not going to provide more information than we have around that but Neptune will have record performance in 2016. So if anybody thought it didn't have some kind of long term reason for performing well, explain to me why they are growing so much.
Joseph Giordano: Fair enough. And last if I could, John, you talked last quarter about, we were talking about Sunquest, some small hospitals, they were taking maybe [indiscernible] and you said that made sense for that size of a customer and your core being large hospitals. Can you just talk about how that went through 3Q? Is that kind of stabilized and then the customer base that you focused on, you remain to be -- the capture rate there is being consistent.
John Humphrey: Yes. It has been consistent. And you are absolutely right, in fact Brian talked about the order intake, right. So remember that fully two-thirds, if not more, of Sunquest revenue is recurring revenue in terms of maintenance on installed software that's already been out there. And so when we look at the order intake, it's a much smaller piece of their total revenue buy. But when they look at their order intake which is about the new Lab 8.0, it's about the new blood bank solution, it's the new outreach solution. So the nurses can start the testing process right at the bedside and be able to start that data flow and workflow to the lab right from the bedside. So all of those upgrades are driving that order intake to be a record level for the third quarter. It is true that on the lower end, the smaller hospitals and integrated solution can make economic sense for them, but the competitive environment and the solution that Sunquest delivers is, it continues to be very good and our competitive position continues to be very strong, particularly in those larger hospitals.
Operator: And we will go next to Brian Gesuale at Raymond James.
Brian Gesuale: I am wondering if you could expand a little bit on Sunquest. You talked about record orders. Maybe just the richness of this product upgrade cycle that we have seen and maybe give us a little bit of a preface as what we might expect in 2017.
Brian Jellison: I think it's early to talk about 2017. We actually have a review coming up with Sunquest in about a month. So we will be talking about not only 2017 but importantly 2018 and 2019, and the plans that they have around the investments there. So one is what I was kind of just mentioning in terms of the continued on the upgrade side around Lab 8.0 and the new blood bank solution. But also wouldn’t ignore the investments that we have made around genetic testing and the workflows associated with that. So you really have the blood side which is the core lab, high volume testing environment that every hospital has to have. And I think of the other side, which is the anatomic technology and the emerging genetic workflows around genetic testing. That’s where we have made important investments with the acquisition of GeneInsight and continued R&D around to be able to make that workflow as efficient and as quick with getting information back to the doctor as timely as happens today on the blood side. And so for all those reasons, I think the Sunquest and our entire platform of hospital software solutions, which of course includes Data Innovations and CliniSys, and GeneInsight and a variety of other things, all of those businesses really deliver those software solutions to hospitals. I think there future looks very bright as a result of the investments that we continue to make there.
Brian Gesuale: Great. That’s helpful. Maybe just a follow-up on the M&A pipeline. It sounds robust. You certainly have a lot of dry powder. Can you maybe talk about the quality of those deals? This ConstructConnect looks very asset light, negative working capital. It appears that the quality is actually increasing as the pipeline is. Could you maybe discuss that?
John Humphrey: Yes. You can really see that when you look at that net working capital chart where you are down 5.8, people think you could never get lower and now we are 1.9. Certainly a lot of that as you get deferred revenue and you get paid in advance for work you do and most of the things that we look at these days have those qualities. So I thought, we get to zero ultimately negative at some point but I don’t see us going up. The amount of small niche businesses that work in kind of oligopolies where customer [indiscernible] is critical and then those that have the ability to have kind of a network effect, there are most of those things out there than you might imagine. Because when you are focused on product businesses, you don’t necessarily see some of these kind of things. But all of the people that are involved in transactions and banking businesses and then private equity businesses, kind of meddle what we favor, what we look like. And so the funnel what we have of incoming opportunity is really amazing. And just incumbent on us to sort through that funnel, find the best management teams. So that’s the end market opportunities that are in favorably competitive environments. And believe me, there is more high quality things available that our balance sheet could tolerate. Fortunately, we have got a big enough balance sheet to capture some of them.
Operator: We will take our next question from Richard Eastman at Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman: Brian, could you just talk for a minute or two about the New York MTA contract. I think you had mentioned there sites should be performed in the fourth quarter, kind of accelerated. Given the size of that contract, are we talking about maybe $20 million to $25 million of revenue in the fourth quarter and then the balance of the sites, the other six sites, does that all fall into the first half of '17?
Brian Jellison: No. No. I think commitment in the contract is pretty specific in terms of what they've been willing to release. And it will be done by November of 2017, is what we're told. There was really even one -- remember you have got the, like ramp, right. So we've been doing some engineering work with them to assure that the overhead kiosk and everything that were being built-in, are going to be okay. So it will start slow. I don't know, maybe we could get $10 million in the fourth quarter of revenue that we have with the rest being -- whatever is it, it's about $72 million for the entire period and it will be really up to them at the pace they want us to do the installation and release of the technology.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Understood. And just then just a last question, I have, just around MHA. There is a lot of noise around drug pricing, both generic as well as branded. And then also I noticed in the Slide that you had, that there was a suggestion that the alternative site solutions business would kind of be a leader here in the fourth quarter. Can you just kind of pull all that together? Has the noise around drug pricing impacted just the revenue stream in the pasture there at MHA, and then also is this alternative site solutions business being kind of the fourth quarter leader? Is there timing there or is there contract renewals or what would drive that in the fourth quarter?
John Humphrey: Yes. Sure. So in terms of its contribution on the growth side, it was up in the 3% or 4% in the third quarter and we expect that to be modestly better in the fourth quarter. From a drug pricing standpoint, I mean you are right, that is something that we look at. A lot of the headlines that you see around drug pricing are really targeted for our being sold to the senior population. Remember MHA is around alternate site healthcare and the largest portion of their revenue is coming from skilled nursing homes, long-term care facilities. It's not really the headline prices around EpiPen or whatever else that you might read in the Wall Street Journal. It's really for kind of the longer chronic illnesses that are being sold through the MHA contracting vehicles. So, we do look at drug pricing. It's been lower than what we would have seen in years past but still positive in 2016. We're not counting on an awful lot of drug pricing lift as we think about the future for MHA. They continue to expand in their solutions in non-drug supply chains, including food and other things around long-term care facilities and other nursing homes. So they continue to expand that. And then they also expand their software solutions around data analytics. You have seen us make a couple of acquisitions that also serve the alternate site healthcare which are not GPO but are really around software solutions that allow those members and customers to run their businesses more efficiently. That's where we look for growth. We don't really count on underlying drug price increases as something that is going to drive our performance, although it does have an impact on our revenue.
Operator: And we will go next to Alex Blanton at Clear Harbor Asset Management. Mr. Blanton, your line is open.
Brian Jellison: Audra, we will have to follow up with Alex, I think.
Operator: All right. And that will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to management for any closing remarks.
Brian Jellison: Well, thank you very much for joining us and we look forward to speaking to you again in about three months.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for your participation.

===== 2016 Q2  (2016-07-25 08:30:00) =====
Executives: John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Laurence Neil Hunn - Group Vice President-Medical Business
Analysts: Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker) Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Operator: The Roper Technologies' Second Quarter 2016 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. I will now turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer.
John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Matt, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss our second quarter financial results. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results. Press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website at www.ropertech.com. If we please turn to slide two, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in on our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. Next slide. Today, we will be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also as a part of this presentation on our website. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consist of two items. First, the $2.5 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue or software acquisitions that we've made. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized, if not for our acquisition. Second, a small inventory step up expense, related to the acquisition of RF IDeas last year in the fourth quarter. Now, if you please turn to slide four, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. We'll take a quick look at sort of summary of the enterprise financial results here in the quarter, and then look at individual performance of the segments and the outlook for each segments and then turn to the guidance for the remainder of the year and go to Q&A. So, next slide is simply the introduction to the Q2 enterprise results; next slide is the explanation of those. So, orders were actually up to a record $956 million. They were up 9% in the quarter and our book-to-bill for the enterprise was 1.02. Revenue was up 5% to $934 million versus last year's first quarter. Organic revenue was down 2%. We had the divestiture that's still in our numbers through the third quarter, the ABEL divestiture, which pulls 1% away and acquisitions were up 8%. We had really terrific growth in medical and in software, and water, we'll talk more about that within those respective segments. But the oil and gas declines were actually worse than we expected. We went into the year thinking that we'd be down maybe in the high-teens to 20%. In the quarter, we were down 25%, but in the upstream areas, we were down dramatically more, 44%, 51%, 52% numbers that really were amazing for us. Those are across all businesses, so they all are directly EPS-type businesses because they don't have much in a way of non-cash amortization. The toll and traffic project delay was also a little bit of a disappointment that Saudi is rolling out their program slowly. We're on track with everything we do, but their rate of initiation of new zones has been slow. Our gross margin was another record, up 90 basis points to 61% and EBITDA was up to $314 million, 33.6% of revenue. Our DEPS number at $1.56 was disappointing from our perspective, because it did hit the low end of the range, but in a quarter where we had record orders or record sales, record backlog and record EBITDA and operating profit, we've just came up a little light on the revenue side from the oil and gas and project delays, each of which probably cost us $6 million to $7 million of revenue and that's why we were at $1.56 million at the low range instead of being up at the higher end of $1.61. Our operating cash flow was $170 million, which was strong in Q2. Year-to-date our operating cash flow has been $414 million which is 23% of revenue and that's a particularly pleasing number when you're going through the sort of oil and gas decline that you could still maintain these kind of ratios. Our recent acquisitions are performing well. We have an extremely strong pipeline, which is very active. We'll talk about it in a little bit. So it was a solid quarter, but we did have to adjust our outlook for the economic realities that we see in the second half of the year and we'll talk about that when we get to guidance. Next slide, here we're looking at the Q2 income statement. As you can see orders up 9%, book-to-bill: 1.02x, revenue up 5%, gross profit was up 6%, gross margin up 90 basis points. The operating income ratio is 27.4% versus last year's 28.5%, but as you can see amortization increased by $10 million and our EBITA performance, if we were reporting that way was lot better in terms of continued sustained upward trends in our ratios. The earnings before tax number was down 2% and the tax rate was a relatively big headwind in the quarter, although the tax rate is really sort of appropriate for us at 29.8%. Last year, we had an extremely unusual event in the Q2 numbers, which was $15.9 million of a good guide that came from a long-term settlement of a tax position. And that really – that $1.70 if you adjusted it for the $0.16 for that one-time benefit would have been $1.54 and this year we're at $1.56. Next slide. If we look here at the revenue bridge, I think most people find this to be quite surprising. The underlying core nature of the business is continuing to grow at double digits. Here you can see, if we looked at last year's second quarter, we printed $892 million. That included the $10 million Puerto Rico situation that we were trying to get out of because of all the reasons everybody knows, we were successful, but it's still in the number in the second quarter at $10 million. Then we have the divestiture of the Eastern German pump company for $6 million and then the oil and gas decrement in the second quarter alone was $33 million. So, those things were a $49 million headwind. If you look at the base spend at $843 million, you'll see we added $91 million to that number. So while the total revenue is up 5%, the revenue excluding the oil and gas and these things that are anniversarying, was up 11%. It's really almost identical to what happened in the first quarter or if you exclude oil and gas and Puerto Rico and the divestiture, we were also up 11%. The good news is that for the balance of the year, we think the second half will be similar, where we'll be up more than 10% excluding oil and gas, but we'll have a better organic growth, so they'll be a little less in the acquisition dollars and more in the organic growth dollars or at least until we do another acquisition. So, actually we felt the growth is pretty solid despite the headwinds. Next slide. Here, you can see that we continue with the governance process we had to make, remarkable progress in our asset-light business model. Two years ago, our inventory was at 6% of revenue and at the end of June this year, it's down to 5.1%, so a 90-basis point improvement. Receivables actually declined from 17.7% to 16.9%. So, we've got a faster receivables, and payables and accruals went up, as we'd like from 17.4% to 18.9%. So, we literally cut our working capital as a function of annualized sales in half in the last two years from 6.2% to 3.1% and that really speaks to the quality of the work that all of our independent operating people do executing our strategy. Next slide. On cash flow performance, again extremely good cash flow performance. Year-to-date, it's $414 million, which is 23% of revenue or free cash flow was 22% of revenue and our operating cash flow conversion was 132%. And note on this slide, you'll see in, two years ago our year-to-date cash flow had been $353 million and last year we printed $433 million, but $20 million of that was a onetime payment by Puerto Rico, as we got out of that situation with Puerto Rico. So, it's real money, but it was a onetime event. So, you take the $20 million, you're looking at $413 million and this year's $414 million, our cash performance will be even stronger in the second half, but still conversion is great. Next slide. From a balance sheet performance perspective, we continue to be very well positioned. You can see that, we've got a completely undrawn revolver of $1.850 billion at the moment, up from $1.185 billion last year. So, if you look at the cash and undrawn revolver, you're getting about $2.5 billion. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is $1.267 billion so our net debt number to EBITDA is running about 1.9 times. And that's after in that 12-month period, we've invested $1.450 billion. So, after $1.45 billion we still have a $1.9 billion debt-to-EBITDA number. So, ample liquidity we've got a very active pipeline. And really most of the numerous acquisitions that we're involved with now in late stages are application software companies and it's likely we'll be doing something soon. Next slide. Here, we'll look at the individual detail, and the outlook for each one of the segments. Next slide, all four segments continued to perform remarkably well. When you look at the kind of fall off in oil and gas that affects the Energy business, and to a lesser degree the Industrial Technology because Roper Pump is sitting in there. Here these two are clipping along with Energy at 26% EBITDA to revenue, and actually sequentially up from the first quarter, and Industrial Technology at 31%. So, those remain remarkable performance numbers. RF/software business at 38%, Medical at 43% as you can see in the Enterprise as a whole running at 37% without the corporate expense. Next slide. So, we'll take the largest segment first, which is Medical. Here you can see that revenue was up 12%. That came from eight points of acquisition and four points overall organic revenue, although imaging pulled that down by a point. So Medical organic in the quarter was 5% which is the 10th consecutive quarter that our Medical organic revenue has been mid-single digits or better and we certainly don't see that slowing. Growth was really led by the adoption of new products in three of our Medical product companies and software businesses as well. We had strong adoption of our Alternate Site Healthcare Solutions businesses where SHP and SoftWriters were growing at a very high rate and our internal software within MHA did well as well. Our new product launches at Sunquest, which would be very important for 2017 and hopefully important yet as the year winds down are launched and on schedule. We've got the sales pipeline which is growing, growing really rapidly and we have a couple of large people that we're talking to but you would expect to begin to see that affect the second half results favorably which you'll see below. In the second half, we think that the organic growth in Medical is going to be in the sort of 6% to 9% range. The product growth that we have in the core products is going to continue, we think that trend. The alternate site growth strengthens here because we are getting some real push out of SHP and SoftWriters becoming organic rather than just acquisitions. And then we actually have some favorable comps that will benefit MHA as the year unfolds. The laboratory software orders are going to increase on the adoption of many new products and while there are literally over 15 different things, that are being launched there are four core large launches around analytics and diagnostic communities and integrated pathologies and clinical content that we think will drive the future of Sunquest. Our imaging businesses are going to benefit in the second half as the cryo-EM technology emergence is getting better understood by people, and sort of our phones are ringing off the hook. They have a strong backlog going into the second half and their product releases are on schedule. Importantly, and here when you look at the operating profit margin, you see 33.7% which is down from the prior year, couple of reasons for that. The newer acquisitions have a lot of amortization. In fact, the second quarter number at 33.7% for OP, when you add back the non-cash amortization of 7.9%, you wind up at 41.6% or the every dollar of revenue contributing. And on an EBITDA basis it's nearly 43%. So, a good mix between Medical products and software and service, and then imaging should do better in the second half. Next slide. In the RF segment, which is really now increasingly a split between RF and software, you can see revenue was up 14%, acquisitions were up 18%, organic was down 4% but the organic revenue on our software and SaaS business segment was up 9%. Our toll and traffic had very strong orders but our revenue declined because of the Puerto Rico contract which finally anniversaried in the second quarter. So, that's a $10 million headwind that goes away. And then the Riyadh project is moving much more slowly. It could easily be $20 million less than what we were told earlier in the year, which is part of the reason for our guide down on the earnings profile. It's still going to continue to happen. The contribution margin we're getting as it rolls out is fine, it's just that it's moving more slowly. And it's not the only thing going into Saudi Arabia these days, it's moving very slow. We had very strong segment book-to-bill here at 1.09. Orders were up 26% with organic orders being up 9%. Again, lots of amortization in this segment. So you see an OP margin of 31.5%, which is up 20 basis points. But when you add back the amortization, which is 5.8% of revenue and the segment and you see the EBITA number is $37.3 million, the EBITDA number is $38.1 million, up 190 basis points from the second quarter of last year. We see at the bottom here in terms of forecasting revenue for the balance of the earnings, the segment organic revenue, we think will be up 5% to 7%. Toll and traffic will improve in the second half. We've gotten strong orders in Q2. The execution of those should be pretty favorable. And we have a big pipeline of opportunity. What has caused us to slow down the guidance for the balance of the year is that decision-making process around that has been slower than normal whether that's related to an election situation with people wondering about kind of ensuring their commitments, it's something that's not clear. Our software and SaaS businesses continue to grow at high-single digits with incredible cash returns that earns other investments and acquisitions. And then RF IDeas business and our On Center acquisitions from last year will go to organic in the fourth quarter, which is why you'll see this bigger mix of organic in the second half of the year and less on acquisitions than you did in the first two quarters. Next slide. On the Industrial Technology segment, here you can see that orders declined, well actually orders were up 3%, but the organic growth's declined by 1%, the divestiture was 3%. The organic, if you exclude oil and gas and Industrial was up 4%. The problem with this segment was simply that the upstream was worse than expected for Roper Pump and we'd expected a big down, but it was down 44%. It's a little bigger than we had anticipated. The good news is that it does appear that that's the bottom of the situation and of course Roper's Pumps' impact for the segment has dramatically deescalated as their revenue has dropped so much over the last two years. Neptune on the other hand is doing extremely well. They had double-digit growth in the second quarter on both orders and revenue. They continue to gain share in the marketplace despite people read about other people that are trying to sell their businesses. Neptune will continue to have record performance. The material analysis portion of the business, sort of test and measurement had record orders in the second quarter, which is very encouraging as their revenue had been down sort of high-single digits. So, that bodes well for the second half. If you look at the second half, we think that the overall organic revenue in the business will be flat because we don't see any improvement in the upstream markets. Although, there's a declining impact in the segment as the underlying base business at Roper Pump is getting very small. Neptune and instrumentation will be able to offset any of the declines we have in oil and gas. And finally in the fourth quarter the divestiture will anniversary and go away. Next slide; here we look at the Energy Systems and Controls segment. You can see that revenue there was down 15% and it's really a tale of two different businesses, the test and measurement business which was okay, and then the oil and gas businesses which were off. So, oil and gas was down 25% in the segment, and that really doesn't quite tell the story either because our petroleum analyzer business excluded a small portion of upstream and has – was really flat with actually improved profit contribution. But compressor controls, which is a high margin business was down by more than a third in revenue and de-levered at a quite high rate. We do feel that, from here, it's no longer is negative on a comparison basis as we started to see of course, some softness throughout the year. We did have sequential margin improvement. You can see the OP margin came in at 22.5% and this segment has some amortization which brought it to 25.8% and EBITDA a little higher. The OP margin in the first quarter was 20.4%, so we ticked up 210 basis points of sequential margin improvement. In the second half of the year, we think that the organic revenue in Energy is likely to be down between 7% and 10%, which is really driven by the continued lack of improvement in any of those oil and gas businesses. We do have an easier comp in the fourth quarter in those oil and gas businesses. They're normal. So there maybe some optimism there and a fourth quarter seasonal increase, we assume will be similar to what it was last year, which was not very good and that could be a positive surprise. The industrial test and measurement businesses will continue to improve. They're doing pretty well now, certainly in a low-to-mid single-digits growth mode and the margins there are going to continue to improve. And so that's quite good and the orders book-to-bill in the segment's about 1, so this seems to be pretty well under control. And we're into the guidance here, next slide, the outlook for the year, we took the full year down to $6.57 to $6.71, which gives you a mid-point, I guess of $6.64, which is certainly lower than what we had before. It's being driven by the more severe downturn in oil and gas. We thought maybe we'd be down in the neighborhood of $75 million in oil and gas for the year, but it – we're going to be down more like $100 million, so that's a $25 million revenue hit. And then the project push-outs in tolling were another sort of $20 million, $25 million. And then there's currency that we didn't have, Brexit and other factors and currency is another $10 million. So there's about $60 million revenue hit there and you can assume that comes in at close to 50% on a contribution basis. And then the rest is really just recognition of a somewhat lower global growth environment, so we think that takes a point or maybe two points off of the organic growth versus what we expected when we initiated guidance at the very beginning of the year. We did a very through bottoms up review for guidance this time with all of our senior operating people involved, and really kind of rebuilding what everybody had to assure ourselves that we were very comfortable with whatever the guidance we're going to put in place. We really could have some things that will become favorable for us. The factors that brought it down, oil and gas, severity, project delays and tolling, global growth challenges, maybe there's a little optimism there, but we're not ready to embed any of that in our guidance. In terms of an upside, certainly the toll projects could accelerate. I think the people had a clear view of what's going to happen with the election. They might have a better idea about whether they think they're going to be personally benefited or not economically from policy. The product launches that we have could ramp faster than we have in our guidance, so it'd be nice but you know, you never know. And then our capital deployment, which we certainly expect to have more of will augment growth as the year unfolds, but it's not in our guidance numbers. We look at kind of forward revenue and EBITDA leverage, and the EBITDA leverage is riding (24:45) a little better than a third of new revenue. So even with the deleverage we got from oil and gas, we're still having overall net positive EBITDA leverage on new revenue. And if we, what else we've got, the sort of organic growth is 2% to 4% with revenue growth of 7% to 9% for the second half. If we did a bridge, like we did at the beginning of the presentation, you'd see it would show similar results with the revenue being up by 10% or more excluding oil and gas. Second half tax rates are probably around 30% and then in the third quarter, we're looking at $1.59 to $1.63. Next slide, here if we look at the summary of what happened in the quarter, you can see for us, we normally we'd talk about the fact that we had record orders and backlog, record sales and operating profit and EBITDA, all of which is good. The margins are good, but we hit the lower end of the guidance, so we just didn't feel like leading what was kind of record results when we were a little bit disappointed on the actual EPS number. Orders, as we said were an all-time record and up 9% with the backlog at $1.14 billion and a book-to-bill well above $1 billion. So, we're well positioned to continue to have a stronger second half. We get rid of the $10 million-a-quarter drag from Puerto Rico beginning now, here in the third quarter and we get rid of the drag on the divestiture of ABEL in the fourth quarter, so little bit of a drag in Q3. Revenue being up 5%, we were able to do that because we had sort of high-single-digit, low-double-digit growth between medical, software and water, which allowed us to survive greater than 40% reduction in our upstream oil and gas businesses. Gross margin at 61%, we feel very good about that. The EBITDA margin is fine, likely to improve in the second half a little bit. Operating cash flow is the same thing, 132% conversion and $414 million. It will be stronger, as it always is in the second half. So, we're quite comfortable with where we are on the operating cash flow. Back in 2014, our oil and gas business was a little above $500 million and 14% of the company. And in 2015 that had dropped to around $400 million and about 11.5% of the company. And today, we think it will finish the year out at around $300 million, which will be less than 8% of the company and the upstream portion is going to be less than 2% (27:29) of the company, with the midstream being around 6%. So the worst is behind us for this kind of change and we're looking forward to that. We've got a very active pipeline. We're open on quite a few deals. We said at the beginning of the year, we'd expect to deploy $1 billion, but $275 million awarded thus far. And it's not going to be difficult to find a way to deploying that level of activity. We still have a great opportunity to continue to compound results. It really continues to drive our strategy. So, we've got our underlying core businesses doing relatively well on a growth perspective. It's just that the oil and gas and unique situation with Puerto Rico which was a win for us, even though it shows up negatively in the first half revenue, keeps us all of our strategies alive and we're very comfortable with our ability to compound results from here out. So, with that, we'll open it up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. We will take our first question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey. Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, Brian or John, I was hoping, you could start with bridging the guidance for third quarter and fourth quarter, just looks like the guidance cut here this morning is weighing higher obviously on the third quarter, down 12% versus consensus, but you're not as severe in the fourth quarter. And maybe is there some seasonality, is it the comps getting easier, better visibility on these product launches, but just some color there on the difference here, assumptions in the third quarter and fourth quarter?
John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, Deane. So, you did touch on it. So one of the things that we're expecting for this year is maybe not historically strong from a seasonality perspective but stronger than what we saw last year. And that's not just on the Energy businesses, but also on some of the other Industrial businesses that have some more seasonal activity as customers flush out some of their budgets. So we do expect that for the fourth quarter and that's why, you see slightly higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter as we look forward to this. My answer must have left everyone dumbfounded. Are we still live on the call here?
Operator: Yes, you're still live.
John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: All right. Next question.
John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So next question, Matt.
Operator: We will now hear from Robert McCarthy with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Deane must have dropped the mic. Good morning, everyone. How're you doing?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey.
John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: He must have. And well, if he comes back we'll insert him back into the queue.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. In any event, maybe you can talk about the Medical business in terms of maybe amplifying your comments around the product launches, the favorable compares to MHA. And then what drives to 6% organic growth versus the 9% organic growth kind of for the back half?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So we had – give Neil Hunn a chance – he's responsible for the Medical and software businesses there an opportunity to explain. The pipeline is growing candidly more rapidly than we could have even hoped for. And he can tell you a little bit about what these new launches at Sunquest are designed to do, so Neil with that fire away.
Laurence Neil Hunn - Group Vice President-Medical Business: Good morning. Yeah, the second half is – have strength across the board. I'll break it down by product and software. On the product side, there's new products at Verathon that continue to gain traction. On the software side, a number of – I think we've talked about before, a number of faster-growing software businesses turned organic, Strata, Data Innovations, SoftWriters, SHP. And then with the second half really at MHA, we see likely, well they are easier comps and then the market conditions around new customer adds give us an opportunity to do better in the second half than the first half.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: But I think people are more interested with Sunquest, so let's just talk about the launch of the new – you've got four major offerings and then you've got mid-teens in terms of enhancements and upgrades at Matt's group are putting in place that we're already starting to solicit revenue. So you might explain what those things do.
Laurence Neil Hunn - Group Vice President-Medical Business: Well, Sunquest, very excited about Sunquest. The reality of the Sunquest is we have worked very hard for the last 18 months on a series of new products. We've talked about those number of new products that are being brand new or material upgrades or enhancement increases being in the high-teens. We're on track for all of that. We've just come off a great user conference at Sunquest, where the customers were excited about the roadmap and what was happening. We've seen a pretty meaningful increase in the pipeline, the sales pipeline, the sales funnel activities that you'd expect to see coming behind a large number of new products. We'd like to see that pipeline convert in the second half. We expect it to convert in the second half. So, we'll see bookings momentum and then that will give us the momentum heading into 2017 for Sunquest that we've talked about in the past.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And switching gears to M&A capital redeployment. I think the messaging maybe up until this call has been a little more muted in kind of the second quarter given where public valuations are for a lot of companies, given where the cost of funds is. Maybe can you just talk about – do you think it's a difficult environment to transact deals, just given political uncertainly, a tentatively rising stock market, with an improving valuations and public fundamentals kind of bleeding into private fundamentals? And then kind of perhaps some of your companies thinking about the alternative route for initial public offerings. Could you just talk about how you look at this environment, and how do you think Roper's going to be able to transact in this environment and what kind of cadence you guys can transact in?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think for us, it's kind of a perfect environment, although you're right about the pricing of assets and the expectation of sellers, is pretty high. But fortunately for us, we're not buying public companies and paying a premium for it. So, we're buying private companies that if they were public would trade at a higher value than they do trade in the private marketplace, which gives us always some beneficial arbitrage. There are as many things available in the acquisition market as I've ever seen. We have looked at billions of dollars of transactions this year, and we're directly engaged with a couple now that have a higher likelihood of closing, I think than the ones that we were looking at earlier in the year because of the quality of the business. Lot of the people that are running these private companies aren't interested in becoming public. They would much rather join our firm – at the public equity in our firm that and not have the quarterly calls and all of the things that you have to do with investors and banks. So we remain a very attractive home for people. And I think that the acquisitions we've made in the last couple of years give us a wider variety of things that we can look at. Application software has a huge number of potential verticals and there are lot of niches within them that the largest people that are, roll-up people aren't going to be interested in, so it's still a very favorable hunting ground for us. Now, the challenge I think for the multi-industry guys in buying things is they tend to not buy things that are as high a quality as what we're buying. And if you're in a marketplace where you're looking for synergies that are going to be driven by overhead absorption or business consolidation or administrative synergies or something, those businesses are trading at a disproportionately high price than where they normally would because the interest rates are so low. The highest quality businesses oddly enough, trade at a much deeper discount to public comps. People will look at Roper and, oh my gosh, look, they pay 12 times for something. Well, if you looked at the public company comp, it was trading at 25 times or 26 times. So, I think that people are focused on product-oriented, more asset intensive businesses that are trading at 12 times or 13 times because of very low interest rates and people are buying them for 12 times or 13 times or 14 times, we're not in that space. We're in a space where we're buying stuff at 12 times or 13 times or 14 times that if it were public would trade at a higher number because of our willingness and experience and how to effectuate those companies joining our public family.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: If you indulge me to one last question and I apologize at the offset to be a little impolite, but do you think this is the last guidance cut we're going to face for 2016?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I do. I've bet money on that.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I'll leave it there. Maybe Deane will get back upon his seat.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Operator: We will now hear from Joe Giordano with Cowen & Company.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. When you – I don't want to beat on Sunquest too much, you've really talked about it, but can you kind of get into a little bit more detail what these new products are actually? Like what actually are they, how are they expanding the platform and maybe talk a bit about the competitive dynamics in that market versus you guys and that bit of concern, how that's been progressing over the last maybe 12 months or something like that?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, it's a great question Joe. So Neil, why don't you kind of explain these four core products and then all the enhancements.
Laurence Neil Hunn - Group Vice President-Medical Business: Sure. Well, I appreciate the opportunity. So let me give you a 30 seconds on the importance of what Sunquest does for our customers. So Sunquest customers are the largest, most complicated laboratories in the United States. These are laboratories that do millions of tests a year. And what our software does is automate from start to finish the laboratory processes. So you get super high quality results at low cost to operate the labs. So what Sunquest, the new – the turn of products ready at Sunquest is to extend that capability that's been steeped in the blood side or the fluid side of the lab and extend it to the other parts of laboratory. So first is a major product that is the integration of the pathologies inside a hospital. So it integrates the blood and to the tissue, to the molecular genetics, very important product for us and for our customers as they deliver medicine inside of their institutions. The second one is a completely refreshed view about how do you collect samples at the bed side. It's mobile enabled, it's integrated into a nurse workflow, important in terms of getting the draws correct, at the right location, with the right patient and get it to the laboratory as quickly as possible. The third category of new products is helping the hospitals extend their reach into the communities, importantly in the changing reimbursement landscape in U.S. healthcare, hospitals want the laboratory samples that are in the community, meaning where the physicians that feeds patients into their hospitals, they want the blood tests that are collected and all the laboratory tests that are collected in the physicians' offices to be routed into the hospitals or laboratory not just to drive volume in laboratory but to get the clinical information. And so we have a series of tools that integrate into the electronic medical records at the physicians' offices for ordering and resulting. And then finally, the laboratory space has been vacant of any meaningful analytics about how they run the operations, how they benchmark themselves against their peers and improve the operations. So we have a large analytics release that's happening in the second half of this year. Those are four net new opportunities. As we talked about earlier, there's a series of other meaningful upgrades. We've just released a major upgrade to our core clinical policy and our core blood bank. We've seen the opportunities associated with those upgrades number in the hundreds and so we're very excited about what the teams be able to build on a product perspective at Sunquest.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for the color, it's really helpful. One, just kind of going with that, typically we see a pretty steep margin ramp in the second half for that segment overall and guessing most of us are probably in that boat right now. So, can you kind of talk us through what drives that historically, and is that something we should still think is applicable for this year?
John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. It really is. It's something that we're expecting as well and it's truly volume driven. So, it's a – and this segment has our highest gross margins across the enterprise with gross margins that are north of 70%. Some of our businesses here even have gross margins above that. And so, as we see incremental growth on the top side, we expect that to fall through. And so that really is what drives the margin improvement as we go throughout the year. And, that's true on not only the software-type businesses like Neil was just talking about, but, also our products businesses and particularly at Gatan and some of our imaging business where they have very high gross margins because of all the technology and all the R&D that we invest there. It does result in high gross margin. So, if the volume increases, we expect that fall-through to improve, and that results in a higher margin in the fourth quarter than what we had throughout the first part of the year.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, good. And then, just last from me quick. On the order growth at RF Tech, is that driven more by TransCore, is that software related? I just want to kind of link that with your comments on who becomes president on the infrastructure side. It does seem like a lot of the road builders and those kind of guys see pretty positive outlooks right now. So, I want to see what you guys are thinking about that business in the U.S., particularly in the second half?
John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, as far as the numbers are concerned – I'll turn it over to Brian on the commentary around the business outlook. But the order quarter growth was both on the toll and traffic side where the book-to-bill ratio was very strong 1.14 I believe. But it was also on the software side. Now, a little bit of that is seasonal, is our CBORD business, in particular, which serves the college, the university market. They have a lot of their renewals and upgrades and security applications that are booked in the second quarter and then delivered or recognized as revenue throughout the year. And so a little bit of that is seasonal, but we saw a fundamental growth on the software orders as well, but the largest reason for the book-to-bill being well above 1 is the backlog that's building on the toll and traffic side. Even though we've seen delays there, we still see fundamental growth happening there in the second half.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning guys.
John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning Joe.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, my first question's on the portfolio. Brian, clearly Energy's surprised to the downside, Industrial remains weak. But – and you guys are continuing to evolve as a technology company. I'm just wondering whether any of the end-market dynamics have kind of changed your view about the portfolio, wonder if there's any potential divestitures that you guys are considering.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No. I'd say the answer is no. You know what, we went into the year thinking that we'd be down about $100 million on oil and gas, which comes in a little bit into Industrial, mostly into Energy. I'm sorry, thought we'd be down about $75 million, now we're going to be down $100 million. So, that $25 million extra negative situation on revenue is disappointing because it comes in at 50% or frankly 60% contribution. So, it's a big EPS number. It doesn't really diminish our cash performance by much at all. And, those businesses at the moment are just a free shot on goal for 2017 and 2018. They're on the books for well – extremely low basis. So, the only way if you were going to do something with them, you'd want to do either a straight spin or a sponsored spin or you'd want to do an RMT with somebody. It'd be safe to say that our phone's been ringing off the hook with people who want to do those kind of things. But we actually think there are substantial upside in those business, just not this year, and probably not in the first three quarters of next year. But, if they start cranking just modestly in 2018, we're going to have windfall kind of results. So, we'd prefer to hold on to them, continue to invest. The Industrial business was 26% EBITDA in the quarter for heaven sake. And, the Energy business, we got 31% in Industrial and 26% in Energy. So, I mean these are really good businesses. Most of our investors, when we talk to the long guys, their fear is, gee, if you put those someplace, how could we trust they can run them as well as you can. And, we always humbly say, well, maybe right. So, these are great businesses. They're just in a situation where if somebody's off 44% to 52%, it's incredible, but they're still able to perform at the levels they are because they're so nimble. So, I don't really see those as necessary sales. We know how to run, we know how to run them well. If they didn't have this extra $25 million headwind in the second half, our guidance reduction wouldn't have been so great. And then no one could predict what happened with what's going on in Saudi is certainly an interesting time and it's effected several of our businesses revenues in the second quarter, so. I think the underlying pieces for us is we've got some cash cow businesses that are at their absolute nadir. They're going to continue to drive a lot of performance over the years and they're a great annuity value for our investors.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got you. That's helpful color, Brian. Maybe switching gears, John, one quick question for you on the Medical and Scientific Imaging margins. In the first half of the year, down 250 plus basis points year-over-year. It looks like the D&A as a percentage of sales was roughly the same as last year. So I'm just wondering, were there any mix issues that impacted the first half as well beyond just the M&A?
John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. I mean, the M&A does have an impact here, right, because we acquired CliniSys, which on an operating profit basis is below the segment average. And frankly, even on an EBITDA basis, it's below the segment average, right. Remember, the segment average here is in the low-40% EBITDA margin range. So the fact that CliniSys comes in at only in the 35%, maybe a little bit less than that EBITDA margin range even drags it down. So that is a contributor. And then the other piece is, frankly, the relative mix between – so our Medical growth so far this year. And in fact for the remainder of the year as well, although not as much in the fourth quarter has been driven more by product, Medical product sales, still terrific businesses and great margin but not the highest margin businesses inside the segment, which is really more of the software and services side. So it's more of a mix issue, but we see that mix issue actually moderating as we go throughout the year and to an earlier question that's why we see some fall through in margin expansion in the fourth quarter.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue.
Operator: Our next participant is Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning.
John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Morning.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): If we look at the tolling and traffic timing, maybe dive into that a little bit more. I think you called out another $25 million or so second half headwind. I guess that's a mix of Riyadh and non-Riyadh pieces, but – is just a – does this project strength into the first half of in 2017, is that the best way to think about that?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, there is no question about this.
John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I mean, yeah that – the decision process – I mean look that decision's made, it's done, we've started, but we would have expected it to be in the thirties of millions of dollars and totally offset some of the issues with Puerto Rico. It's going to be above $10 million. How much above that is hard to say. If you'd really – they're doing a massive transit system over there. They've got lots of priorities. They're extremely happy with our performance. We're happy with the relationship. It's going to be extremely valuable over a long period of time, but in the short run, we're going to likely get at least $20 million less than we expected in the beginning of the year. And we've got somewhat less in the quarter. In this quarter and all of our numbers issues are really just around the severity of the upstream being far worse than we thought and the toll and traffic kind of stuff, if you look at the quarter is pretty significant. When you look at the year, it's easier to calibrate now.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then the non...?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You know just so you understand it's true, the projects are just getting pushed out. So if we're not having them now, they'll come in, whether they come in in the fourth quarter or they come in in the first quarter, they're going to come in.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And that holds for Riyadh and non-Riyadh, correct?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Absolutely correct.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then the Neptune growth was really standout. Any lumpy there or is that just broad-based rich execution?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think it's a combination of market share growth and all the normalized stuff and then them getting what we knew would be the lion share of new business from a customer that they didn't do much business with for the last couple of years. So, other people were talking about big revenue, we're showing big revenue.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, Energy Systems, you alluded to the – what's baked into the guidance is a weak 4Q seasonal ramp like last year, but you dangled positive surprise prospects in there. What's the kind of thought process behind dangling that?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we just don't know. Last year was – normally you get – basically because people have a lot of MRO left at the end of the year, but we didn't see any benefit of that because people just shutdown. This year, all year along anybody who's in the upstream business would know that people are cannibalizing what they've got, nobody is buying anything, rental fleets are in distress. But there're an increasing number of signals that would say that the cannibalization of all the stacked horsepower business out there, at some point will turn into new orders in revenue. We just have no idea where it will be. We do expect a modest improvement in the fourth quarter of this year, versus last year and could it be even better, I don't know.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Operator: Next we will hear from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes, good morning.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, good morning.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Brian or John, could you just speak for a second, the order number that you've put up there, what was the core order number in the quarter?
John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Organically, orders were up 2%.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Plus 2%, okay. And then, the assumption would be that that's pretty much driven by Med-Scientific is that reasonable core order?
John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So the core – so the organic orders, I wanted to give that to you by segment. So, in the Medical segment it was plus 2%. In RF it was plus 9%. It was plus 2% in Industrial and minus 11% in Energy.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Energy, okay. All right, I see. Okay. And then, also within the Med-Scientific piece of the business, could you just maybe sift through the core revenue growth, local currency was plus 4%. How did the Medical products do versus the software and SaaS business? Is it – I was just trying to pick up on the cadence there. The software and SaaS business effectively much better in the second half, how was it relative to the 4% core growth this quarter?
John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, the Medical products was up, I know it was in the 9% or 10% range, with the medical, software and services up I think 1%. And so, as we go throughout the year, that relative mix probably changes a little bit out if it goes to 8.2% or if it goes to 7.3%, but it's in that range. Maybe even it stays at 8% then the medical, software and services comes up a little bit. But that's the relative contribution right there. There's also little bit of what we were talking about with the margin impact and the outlook for the rest of the year.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I understand. Okay. And then, just one last question for Brian. You had mentioned earlier in the M&A pipeline, it was full, the application software businesses. There were a lot of those prospects in there. Is there anything that Roper could do in that application software area that would have more scale? We've seen good success with Sunquest and MHA, and tucking in some related businesses at Sunquest, at CliniSys and GeneInsight and Atlas. And I'm curious, do we stay on that path with the – more of the bolt-ons to Sunquest and MHA or is there something in there with some scale that we could pull in?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, it's a really good question. The answer is yes and yes. So, one of the incredible things about Sunquest and MHA is their platform status. So, if they allow us to do these incredibly attractive small acquisitions that we wouldn't do on our own. I mean, things like SoftWriters and Strata, and they're just really amazing. I mean, these are very high growth businesses and hopefully, we'll continue like that even though they're on a small base. If you look at the last large transaction was Aderant. There are a lot of things that are sort of the size of Aderant. And Aderant also offers us an opportunity for some bolt-on acquisitions to kind of grow its platform status. I would hope that the next acquisition we have is more like that where it's meaningful, it's something that we know how to do. People would be confident that we're already doing those kind of things. So that is likely what the next thing would be. Now, that said, this year we've looked at a number of very large transactions, and...
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: ...those are always an interest. We're incredibly conservative and careful around those. But I would be disappointed in the next two years or three years if we didn't do a quite large transaction.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): So, are there opportunities or targets in the pipeline that are not Medical-Scientific? I know Aderant was an exception there. But I'm thinking, anything literally it's a bad word these days, but something on the Industrial side that would be more software or SaaS, is there any of those opportunities in the pipeline?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, there aren't a lot of Industrial situations. There are a few, but there are a lot of things that are not medical, that are vertical, just like Aderant is certainly not a Medical business.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Some of the other acquisitions we've made are not Medical at all. I think that you're likely to see some acquisitions that are not Medical at all, that's why we're kind of suggesting...
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: ...there's a lot of attractive application software businesses that are immediately in front of us.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And there are project management businesses that are out there. Quite a few of those that are very interesting, some which are sort of horizontal opportunities and others that are small vertical. So...
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We have enough internal intellectual capital to handle a large acquisition that would not be in the Medical space.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Welcome.
Operator: That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Matt and thank you all this morning. And we look forward to talking to you again in October.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: The Roper Technologies' First Quarter 2016 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Leann, and thank you all for joining us this morning, as we discuss our first quarter results. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, Vice President of Planning and Investor Relations. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The Press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the web cast, and also on our web site. So if you please turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. Next slide? Today, we will be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, a full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also the part of this presentation on our website. For the first quarter, the difference between GAAP results and adjusted results, consists of three items. Our normal adjustments related to recently acquired businesses on both deferred revenue and inventory valuation which totaled $3 million to both revenue and income measures. We have also adjusted our operating cash flow to account for the cash taxes paid in the first quarter for the Abel divestiture. The Abel divestiture you may recall was completed in the fourth quarter of last year. GAAP required this amount, $37 million in those tax payments, to be reported as an operating cash flow item even though it is related to that divestiture. We’ve added this $37 million back to reflect the ongoing nature of our cash flow.  Now if you please turn the Slide 4, I’ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and after his remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: Thank you, John. So we’ll go through today the first quarter enterprise results and we’ll look at the detail around the four segments. And the outlook for the remaining of the year and while we’re doing that, we’ll comment on the second quarter and full year guidance at the end and then take your questions. Next slide. So we start with the Q1 enterprise results. Go to next slide, Slide 6. You can see there is a lot of great thing here, was a very, very good quarter for us and certainly puts us on track for a record 2016, but just one word I’d say before we get started, Mr. Humphrey over here is actually just celebrating this month his 10 completed year with the enterprise. And as John refer to it’s actually his 40th quarter. So with that, let’s take a look at our first quarter and congratulations John. Revenue was up 4.4% to 906 million versus the first quarter over a year ago and organic, you can see was down 3.2%, which is really not the story, because excluding oil and gas the company’s organic was actually up around 1% and if you look at the headwinds that we knew we had with the end of Toronto and Puerto Rico and so forth really the underlying basis, the activity seeing better than that or like plus 3. Our orders are up 9% in the quarter to a record. Book-to-bill was really spectacular, because we haven’t had a book-to-bill above 101 for 2.5 years, this time [indiscernible] combined industrial energy together the book-to-bill was 104, medical was 103 and RF was even just here above 1, but actually had an adjustment in there for some debookings around the business that we’re doing something with and otherwise it would have been 102. So very good backlog at 1.2 billion is also very good. Gross margin was spectacular, gross margin was up 210 basis points to 62.1% and what’s really remarkable given the macroeconomic challenges around the world is each of our four segments improved the gross margin in the first quarter. EBITDA was up 4% and reached 34% EBITDA margin, we’re going to talks more about that, we still don’t report on cash earnings, but increasingly, we need to make sure people understand the quality of our earnings and the cash earnings nature, because we just have so much non-cash amortization. Our earnings per share in the first quarter were $1.50. Our operating cash flow was 245 million, which represented 27% of our revenue. And the recent acquisitions that we’ve made in 2015, are really performing sort of beyond very well, they have outstanding growth, almost all of them are double-digit grower, so we’ll talk more about that throughout today’s session. We deploy 265 million in acquisitions in the first quarter, we have extremely big and attractive pipeline that we’ll talk a little bit more. And so with that we can move to Slide, next Slide, which is 7. On the income statement, just to kind of backup some idea about how importantly orders were, I’ll give you our book-to-bill for the last eight quarters was, last year it started out at 98 then 102 on a consolidated basis here. The next quarter was 99 then 101.98, a year before that, it was 101.99-101.98. So you have all way back to Q2 ’13 to see something as high as the book-to-bill we got here. And that was despite revenue being up. Gross profit was up 8%, our operating income was basically flat to the prior period, but that’s only because amortization in the quarter was up 120 basis points or $11 million, all of which is not in cash. So big difference between reporting GAAP operating income and what’s really happening on the cash quality of the earnings. Interest expense was up 7 million, we did $900 million bond offering. In December, which really kind of term out, what we were doing on the revolver. So it gives us substantial capacity well over 1.8 billion [ph] to be able to deploy here a capital deployments throughout the year and it’s certainly worth of the nickel impact. That said the different swings last year’s $1.55 and $1.50 is in track with that nickel. Next Slide, if we look here as operating in EBITA margins as the company. You’ll see that incrementally the operating margin went from 28.7 to 27.4 that’s with the 120 basis points of amortization, near the backend, you can see essentially it was the same outstanding results as the year before. On the right hand side though so you can see the EBITA margins, which increasingly are more important for us and here there is no D in either side of that equation, this is just earnings before interest tax and amortization. So that’s actually up in the last two years, 130 basis points from 31.6% to 32.9%. Furthermore, this gross margin increase that we’re getting is encouraging us, which we’re doing at a fast pace to step-up our R&D and engineering investment, which in this quarter was up 120 basis points over the first quarter of last year, it is now reaching 7% of revenue. Next Slide. Our asset like business model continues and were still easily able to compound our investment and asset like businesses and you get some sense about how important that is. So there is two aspects to slide like this, one is our governance process with our existing business and the second is the quality of the businesses that we continue to acquire. At the end of the firsts quarter just three years ago in 2013, our net number here was 7.7%, today it’s 4%. Nearly a 50% reduction in just three years. Inventory back at ’13 was 6.8% today it’s 5.5% receivables were 19.3 and in a tough markets for receivables today they are only 17.4 and payables were 18.4 and now there 19, all go in our way. So we go from 7.7% down the 4% and even just in the last two years they’ve gone from 6.3 % to 4% which is truly a remarkable number, we’re very proud of all of our people focusing on asset velocity and the quality of the businesses that new leadership teams are bringing to us as we acquire them, next slide. To look at our cash flow per performance here you can see in the quarter operating cash flow was 27% of revenue, free cash flow was 26% of revenue, that’s not a gross margin number, that’s the free cash flow to revenue number 26%. Trailing 12 months operating cash conversion is a 135% and even though the cash conversation is a quarter above 150, we really thought it’s much more balanced to look at the trailing 12 months operating cash flow to eliminate quarterly seasonality that occurs sometimes so, even there you can see gone from 8.44 to 9.13 and a we fully expect this year’s operating cash flow for the full year would be a $1 billion or more.  We’re continuing to compound cash flow despite these macroeconomic challenges and they are quite substantial for us, we had about a $100 million of foreign exchange in last twelve months and another $100 million of oil and gas headwinds and also the Toronto project for a millions of dollars and Puerto Rico escape which was another $10 million a quarter. So that compounding is to continuing the same way we would expect it to contain and we still think cash is the best measure of performs, next slide. If we look at the financial position the balance sheet is in really great shape, gives us tremendous amount of powder for capital deployment and our pipeline is really as good, maybe the best it’s ever been. Here you can see we still have the $0.5 billion of cash, our undrawn revolver is actually paid off now it’s $1.850 billion which is very substantial if you look at cash and the undrawn revolver you’d be over $2.3 billion and you could see the EBITDA at a billion 256 will continue grow handsomely throughout the year so we’ll have a very solid debt ratio opportunities. If you look at the last 15 months, we’ve deployed over $2 billion in acquisitions and with a $1.8 billion undrawn revolver we could absolutely repeat that effort and deploy another $2 billion in the next 15 to 18 months, next slide.  Here we get into the very specific segment detail, next slide. So in the first quarter the segment performance you can see here was again very strong all the way across for line on our EBITDA measurement down at the bottom, there are two really big messages that we try to convey with the slide, and first is there are RF software segment and the medical solution segments together represent over three quarters of the Company’s total EBITDA. But there is equally important messages here on the left hand side were we look at the energy and industrial business which remain as really extraordinary businesses. Those two business you can see how 25% EBITDA and energy even with all of the difficulty that you see we have very nimble leadership and the quality of those businesses still allow us to drive this kind of result, if you combined the two together $119 million in energy and $171 million in industry you only have $300 million out of our 906 in revenue, and yet you have 81 million of EBITDA on a $300 million base or 27% and those EBITDA margins in energy are going to continue to approve throughout the year. So great extraordinary businesses in industrial energy despite oil and gas, and oil and gas has becoming less and less critical and hear it’s well less than 9% of revenue. All right next slide. We start off with the smaller segment which is energy. Energy had negative organic in the quarter of 14%, but essentially all of that was driven by the oil and gas business which now represents just a little over half of the total segment and inside energy it’s different than the industrial portion of oil and gas because our energy business is primarily downstream about 75% downstream, about 25% up stream and the FX as you can see was 1 point. Oil and gas as a portion of the energy segment was down a low level 20% which is pretty much consistent with what we expected throughout the year, the biggest challenge and there used to be our diesel engine shutout valve business, this year it will shift over really to our compressor control business and they’re moving quickly to try to address everything they can do from short fall in project that we will see throughout the year. Very nimble execution, we haven’t really talked to the market about and the restructuring we’ve done which is been pretty considerable and we’ll do a little bit more in the second quarter, but we’re really not even asking for an adjustment on our restructuring investments because the payback is pretty quick. Zetec in the quarter did extremely well, which was up high single digits, there is a lot of activity around the power generation side in Nuclear and Zetec is best-in-class in this area and its going to enjoy some continuing tailwinds for the next couple of years. And then just as we move to thinking about the remainder of the year Q2 through Q4, I’ll just remind you that with the pullback in oil and gas about half of the energy systems business is actually industrial, measurement, technologies. We expect high single-digits organic decline in the rest of year, but that’s just because of the oil and gas. And then we think we’ll get this modest growth in the other half of the sector and we think margins will improve throughout the year sequentially and in energies you can see now it’s down to only 9% of the company’s EBITDA. Next side. If you look at industrial technology, the same situation with the oil and gas organic as a segment was down 5%. However, if you exclude oil and gas, industrial was up organically 3% in the quarter. So the upstream activity which in here is really Roper pump and a little bit of an adjacency there that upstream is about 80% of the market. And the total value of that, it’s only about $10 million out of a 171 million in the segment. So it’s down to less than 5% of revenue. Neptune had a really strong quarter, they were up double digits, then enjoying very good U.S. which overcame the fact this was the last quarter with the negative Toronto project variance which was mid-millions of dollars of headwind. This segment EBITDA margin I think if we can get a look at to which were really 30.1% on industrial. So the performance despite any of the headwinds that you see is still very solid. In second half of the year, we’re look at kind of low single digit organic growth for the segment. We don’t see any improvement in upstream oil and gas, we think that will actually continue to decline a little bit, but we’ll have kind of flat to modest growth in all of the other markets and then very strong growth at Neptune because as we get into the second quarter, the Toronto project tailwind is essentially behind gas and that was worth quite a bit of -- will be quite a bit of positive variance now in 2, 3 and 4. Next slide. If you look at the RF and technology and software business and we have to throw the software recognition in here because the software business is actually becoming larger than the totaling business. So when we look at the segment you can see organic was down 1, but actually organic would have been up excluding the roll-off of the Puerto Rico exit that we had, which was $10 million just in that quarter. We had record margin performance throughout this segment, very strong software and SaaS business growth with terrific margins and cash flow and all of those businesses added into our most recent acquisitions performing very well, we got several new wins which are of strategic importance that legal community can be talking about and has already started to discuss and comment on our share gains. In the toll and traffic area, as we say our IPS business was down because of Puerto Rico, our Tag business continued to be strong, very good project execution and I also want to point out that that OP margin which was up 170 basis points to 32.2, again realized the quality of the cash margin. Our EBITDA margins were at 39.2% up 360 basis points so did the first quarter of the year ago. As we look to the second quarter we expect flat organic growth in Q2 only because we still have one more quarter of the Puerto Rico drag of about 10 million bucks and that’s 3 to 4 points. But in the second half, we’ll have a much stronger organic growth because the Puerto Rico comps will be going away. We’ll get multiple opportunities we think in the Transco projects, we have very exceptional amount of bids in line, pretty confident in a lot of those, and the timing of when those are able to be announced will be important for us. And then the RF ideas which is doing phenomenally well will become organic in the fourth quarter so that will help our organic revenue comparisons. The software and SaaS business should grow kind of mid to high single digits, just a little bit better than we might have expected previously and they gives us strong cash returns. And then Aderant's is going to continue to gain shares which will help the segment. Next slide. Here we look at the medical solutions. Medical solutions points to another EBITDA margin story. You see the operating profit margin at 34.7, but that’s just because it has a lot of non-cash amortization, our EBITDA margins are 43.5% in Medical. Organic was up 2%, acquisitions added 13% but medicals organics as a standalone portion of the segment was up 6% organically while imaging was down 13%. We had double digit growth in the medical product which really was driven primarily by Verathon and Northern Digital. The acquisitions that we’ve made in this segment, our performing extremely well, if you put them all together, they actually or growing both at double-digit revenue and EBITDA basis. We had really exceptional growth at Strata, which is up very dramatically, as more hospitals understand what we’re doing and are signing up for our SaaS solution on their cost visibility and how to contain and structure your costs. We acquired a small business called TCI Medical in the quarter, which will boost Civco’s offering in Ultrasound and that business is close, we’ll add some revenue for us. If you look at the balance of the year, you have high single digit organic growth in the segment, that comes from continued strength in the medical arena and then Strata SoftWriters and data innovations become organic in Q2, which will make those comps stand out. Very strong performance in all of those acquisitions, the IPA business that we announced some time ago has done particularly well from a growth perspective. Imaging will continue to improve with kind of substantial gains out of Gatan. Gatan, we’re pointing a lot of money in innovation at Gatan to focus on cryo-EM markets, this involve significant R&D investments, but with really exciting out year opportunity, some of you have read about the discovery of the Zika Virus and how that was done and our products were absolutely crucial to the discovery, technologies that have been announced recently. We have positive contributions from our CliniSys acquisition, although CliniSys comes in initially at lower margins in the rest of our business, but we’ll continue to improve those as we work with them. Sunquest Investments in Genetics continues we acquired on just a day after the quarter, so we didn’t include it in here GeneInsight, which is a technology and business that was really good by partners help that we’ve been doing in concert with and will have long-term applications in the out years at Medical. Also I would just say that, when you look at medical in this pie chart down here it’s 43% of the company’s total EBITDA and to put that in perspective, you can see energy the smallest piece of that pie and industrial is the next smallest. Those two together are only 24% of our EBITDA, Medical is 43% and RF is 33%, so you can see what the future looks like. Next Slide. So here we get into the guidance of the company. For the balance of the year, next slide. So the guidance of date that we’re going to continue our current guidance as we articulated at beginning of the year. So we said the full year would be between 6.85 and 7.15 with the mid-point of $7 and then operating cash flow would be about a billion dollars. And our tax rate guidance is the same it was at the beginning of the year and really everything else, we see the same sort of revenue opportunities. There is one thing, we say about the second quarter, where we establish the guidance at 1.56 to 1.61. We had an extraordinarily low tax rate in the second quarter last year that some people were maybe looking at carefully. Tax rate was only 25%, we would expect the tax rate in the second quarter to be 30% to 30.5%. Another piece of good news, when we look at FY, we’re really comfortable with the second half of the year. We’re not really seeing any industrial contagion at all in those portions of industrially or the energy businesses that have not oil and gas. And certainly at the beginning of the year that was something that many people were worried about. And the high-end of our end what we really just be dependent on the adoption rates and project timing and seasonal activity. So it’s sure quite good about reinforcing the full year guidance. Next slide. If we look at the summary of 2016, it’s pretty simple series of things here, right. Revenue is up 4.4%, Medical and Software and Neptune were able to offset all of the declines in oil and gas. Our orders reached record level and got over a billion dollar backlog. Our gross margin, which would let you know how customers continue to feel about us and the products and services we provide or up 210 basis points and as we said each of the four segments increased their gross margin. Good thing is we're investing at the fastest rate in our history in R&D. Our EBITA margin, you can see is 32.9%, not all EBITDA is the same, we’re already sometimes frustrated people telling us about some of these EBITDA margins, but it’s really mostly D and then the CapEx sucks our away. In our world, the linkage between EBITDA 34 and EBITA 32.9 is only a 110 basis points. EBITDA as we said was up 4% to 307, acquisitions performing very well. We really can’t say enough about how well the acquired leadership teams are performing and how well they’ve embraced the Roper governance process. Every single one of these acquisitions is outperforming our expectation. And we have very attractive pipeline and we had said earlier this year, we expect to deploy over a billion in the year and it could easily be more than that. So great quarter on track for record 2016 and with that we’ll open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go ahead and take our first question from Scott Davis with Barclays. 
Scott Davis: Just trying to get a sense, I don’t think I’ve ever asked this question before and you may not have the answer off the top of your head, but you said 2015 acquisitions performing very well and clearly that looks to be the case, but can you quantify that? Is there a cash return on capital on those deals that you could quote for the first 12 months out or expected for 2016 or something that we could hang our hat on?
Brian Jellison: Well I think, you’ve been around us a lot to know that I am not a fan of return on invested capital where people look at stuff and don’t add back accumulated depreciation and don’t really realize how much future drawn cash, their CapEx will be. So in our world we look at new cash return on investment. So in that case, you look at the net earnings of the business and then you add back the non-cash charges and you divide it by the gross investment which is the physical plant & equipment plus accumulative depreciation plus networking capital. All of this acquisitions are well above 100% cash returns many of them are in the several hundred percent, cash return basis and some of them get paid in advance for what they do, so they have a negative cash return which is even more powerful. So they are all doing it very well, I think there is a general rule and more you can assume that our acquisitions are going to come in and they’re going to be substantially above the 34% EBITDA margin that the overall enterprise has and that they are going to have higher gross margins than the enterprise and they’re going to have higher cash returns than the enterprise. 
Scott Davis: Okay. Fair enough and as far as you put a lot of capital to work last year I think it was somewhere than 1.85 billion, would you anticipate I mean say over 1 billion in 2016 book, but you also said you have $1.8 billion or so of firepower, would you anticipate something closer to 1 billion or closer to the 1.8 billion that you have in the hoppers as a potential or is it just too early to say?
Brian Jellison: I think that we don’t sort of budget like let’s deploy $1 billion. So just thinking about what we think about it is very simple is we’re going to deploy our cash flow, we’re going to leverage it three times or more debt to the acquired EBITDA. So given this usually its more between 1.35 and 1.5 times our -- the powder of whatever our cash flow is. So if we have 1 billion in operating cash flow, we pay out some dividends or whatever and we multiply that to the acquisitions, it is very easy for us to deploy a 1.3 billion to 1.5 billion all the time. So that’s why we say we’ll deploy 8 billion over the next four or five years and as we said we deployed 2 billion in the last 15 months, we could easily deploy 2 billion in the next 15 months. So it’s not like a budgetary thing, Scott. I mean we’re looking at things now that are over 2 billion and we’re looking at things that are in the mid-100s of million and which ones we do and when they close is never thought of as a budget kind of thing but our balance sheet capacity and our debt ratios give us as much or more opportunities to invest than we’ve ever had. 
Scott Davis: Okay, great. Good reminder. Thanks guys and congrats on the start of the year. 
Operator: Then we’ll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Just giving all anxiety we had last quarter regarding oil, it’s interesting and some relief that the comments that you’re expecting to see, margins improved sequentially in energy this year. So any comments on the visibility, the backlog and I know you didn’t call it out, you mentioned you did restructuring this quarter, but could recite it for us how much restructuring was done and what that payback is?
Brian Jellison: We got a little bit towards the end of last year in anticipation of the difficulty we did more in the first quarter, we’ll do couple of million dollars here probably in the second quarter, some of that you make the announcement, it takes a long time for people in Europe but we’ll continue to pull back a little bit on the sort of baseline SG&A, but the businesses are really small I think if you add them all up we had about 65 million of oil and gas revenue in energy and about 10 million in industrial, right. So, they really don’t have huge cost basis, they are very high margin businesses, if you look at them with sort of 30% pretax numbers or higher there is just not a lot of cost beside that takeout, we don’t have big factories that we have to worry about with absorption issues and what have you. So there is another couple of million, I think we feel like where we could be.
Deane Dray: And then on organic guidance, I know you had a lot of moving parts in the second quarter especially, but what you’re expecting for organic second quarter and how about for the year versus the previous guidance of 2% to 4%.
John Humphrey: We’re still in the same spot as we were when we issued the guidance with respect to the full year, in the 2% to 4% organic, that does imply or in fact it’s a part of our expectation that the second half will be in the mid-single digit organic growth, second quarter would be about flat. 
Deane Dray: Got it and just one last quick on, corporate expense came in a little bit light then what we were looking for where there any unusual items and or timing within corporate?
John Humphrey: No, we’re not in fact that it was about what we had expected, in the it encompasses both from deal expenses as well as the equity compensation for the Company is all recorded that the corporate G&A line, in fact the stock price is up nicely from where it was last year that’s reflecting in that number also.
Deane Dray: Got it actually I emphasize that was -- it came in higher then what we were looking for so, just want to --.
Brian Jellison: That is a directly tied to the share price going up, it’s of equity comp.
Deane Dray: Thank you.
John Humphrey: We help it goes up higher again, it’s a noncash charge. 
Operator: And we go ahead and take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman: A couple of things in the mid scientific medical products business the core organic growth in the quarter in orders, what did that look like and may be was there a book to bill in the core business there ex acquisitions?
Brian Jellison: We saw in organic basis for medical we were up 9% versus last year and the book to bill ratio was somewhere to the total, just a little bit above 1 even on core basis. 
Richard Eastman: Okay. And MHA's business, is the pricing component there of their business, is it holding flat or has that improved at all?
Brian Jellison: So the pricing component for the branded drugs is continuing to be a positive contributor there, you do have some other impacts around generics which are either down a little bit or flat in prior you know last in couple of years those have actually been up, so in that net-net pricing is about -- is up very modestly for that not very much. 
Richard Eastman: Okay. But at least flat. Okay. And then just one last question. On the RF business, the EBIT margin there, we have some real positive puts and takes, namely Puerto Rico's exit and then Aderant coming into the revenue and profit number. But is it a reset EBIT run rate that starts to push 32%? Does that start to be somewhat sustainable at that level?
Brian Jellison: Sure, yes. I think it will be in a low 30% range for the year, of course the timing of that -- the software businesses that we have are clearly higher margin, the timing associated with some of our toll and traffic projects which are often times little bit more on the equity side, and have a little bit more of a cost component to them even though there is not any negative drag from a cash flow prospective. Those margins come in a little bit below the average for the segment and so it’s about timing of the IPS project of the toll and traffic project, but will effect that. We still see north of 30% margins here for the remainder of the year.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Shannon O’Callaghan with UBS.
Shannon O’Callaghan: A couple questions on medical. One, in terms of the plus 6% ex the imaging fees, the plus 6%, MHA, I think, had some comps in the quarter. With MHA down, would medical have been up even more? And then, also, as we think about margins for the second quarter and the year, should medical margins be down again because of either MHA comps or other comps or anything else? Or should we think about those starting to grow again? 
Brian Jellison: You know I think too we’re seeing on the medical, we want to have people understand, but we’re going to continue make acquisitions there, we have extraordinary margins that we had with Sunquest and MHA. We’re going to make lot of acquisitions and we’re going to have better then enterprise margins, but they’ll be dilutive to software component inside medical. So this doesn’t bother as in any way. Now medical products had spectacular performance versus the medical software which in services -- so we’ve put Sunquest and MHA in the medical software services component and they were down a little bit organically in the first quarter, medical products was up more than double digit and off-course we still have the little bit corruption around imagining because we’ve actually been intentionally winding down certain of kind of imaging businesses while we’re going to have much better growth in Gatan. But the camera stuff this, we are trying to only participate in profitable markets, I don’t know if that helps you, but that’s the best way to explain it.
John Humphrey: And remember the margins in this segment are just extra ordinary [multiple speakers], we expect our operating basis to maintain in the mid-30% all year.
Shannon O’Callaghan: Yes, that's fine. I knew that there was some lumpiness this quarter. Just in terms of getting the margins and the modeling and just lumpiness in terms of some of the margin contracts, that's all I meant. In terms of energy, Brian, you sound pretty constructive on the non-oil and gas parts of energy. Can you give a little more color there, Zetec and also the other pieces, what you're seeing there that you like?
Brian Jellison: Well, we like that they’re not going down. They're inching ahead into low single-digit growth in both sectors, but industrials are going to have better growth because of Neptune. And then in energy we are getting a bit better growth in small business called DJ Instruments, we have business called Alpha that should have a stronger second half and Zetec is high single digits, might even get to the 10% growth, that’s really becoming a secular trend for that. So for a while with Fukushima and other problems with bringing things online, Zetec was really challenged. But today these people are working with us on all kinds of new applications, so we feel really quite good about that. But it’s a relatively small business within the enterprise, but nonetheless important.
Operator: And our next question will come from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie: My first question's, going back to your comment on M&A, Brian, you said it's the best it's ever been. I'm just curious, how much of that is being driven by the IPO market not being all that great right now and PEs having a hard time exiting? I'm just wondering what the driving factors are there.
Brian Jellison: I don’t think, it's really the IPO market, because generally the kind of things we acquire are things that probably wouldn’t go the IPO route. They would either go to a strategic or they’d get flipped to another private equity group. So I think there is a lot of forces of the work, there has certainly been lumpy feedback to sellers about just how much debt capacity they can get on things. Although frankly we don’t ever see any -- well we see one thing right now but it's got six-times staple, but another one that we’re really pursuing as a six and three quarter staple, there are still some seven staples. But the cost of debt has flipped around quite a lot, sometimes the mezzanine portion unsecured bonds of 10.5% other times they are 9% and the LIBOR 4% has been in play sometimes, maybe they gets 4.75 on the term loan. But it's really isn’t because there’ll be LIBOR 4 of 100 spent, 5.75. So I do think that there are a lot of private equity people feel as that they’ve got an asset that they are going to sell in the foreseeable future, it may still be as good a time now to sale. And they changed weekly, and first they are very opportunistic right; so our situation, we are not affected by those things and our ability to finance stuff is certainly easier and better than their cost of debt, so I think that helps. But also there is lot of things we are looking at, they have been in various portfolios for a while, and they need to get out. They might be more worried about the financing markets in 2017 than they are announced. So I can think of the time we’ve made a call, somebody has talked to them about their business that they haven’t said come on over.
Joe Ritchie: That's interesting color and helpful. Maybe switching gears a little bit, you mentioned some of the known headwinds in the first half with Puerto Rico and Toronto. As we look into the second-half ramp, what do you need to see from an order standpoint? And how important is the second quarter to hit your organic growth ramp in the second half?
Brian Jellison: Well, what happens is, if you just think about the things that are going away that are reflecting us negatively. I mean if you adjusted for all of our headwinds, which is ridiculous. When you adjust for everything, it's bad. But if you really look through headwinds, we would have been up over 3.5% organically. So the idea that we are going up 2 to 4 organically over the course of the year is not a big challenge. I mean we should do pretty well in the second half, now things that can effect that are going to be the adoption rate of new products and some versions of software that are rolling out in second half, but you never know what those adoption rates will look like, great. So if they are high then we have a much better opportunity to get to that midpoint number above if they are moderate then it's harder. The second thing on the tolling projects, we have an enormous amount of bid activity right now. But there is never anything us as a supplier can do to influence the beginning or the execution of those projects. So if they go at an expected pace then that helps, if they go as a slow pace that it’s not particularly helpful and then last year we got nothing, out of the year-end instrumentation businesses in terms of seasonality, that’s the only time that’s happened in a decade. So we would expect to get some more modest returns to seasonality in the fourth quarter in those instrumentation businesses. So those are the things that will determine where we’re at, but within our guidance we’re certainly comfortable that we’re going to be within our guidance for the year irrespective of what happens with Q2 orders.
Operator:
.:
Stephen Tusa: Just a quick one on healthcare. What do you think for the second quarter organic? And then these acquisitions are obviously crushing it. Just remind us of the impact on the ones that are coming in in the second quarter. And then when you say they're growing strong, I think its Strata and Data Innovations. Are you talking these things are growing 20% plus? Just trying to understand those dynamics because the acquisitions coming in are a big driver.
Brian Jellison: So as far as the segment is concerned, we expect that we are up in high single digits in the second quarter on an organic basis and that is aided a little bit by those acquisitions that turn organic because they’ve been growing, you’re right are well into the double digits even above 20% or maybe a little more. And so they add a couple of points to us for that --.
Stephen Tusa: And those combined last year were like $25 million, something in that range, in the quarter?
Brian Jellison: [Multiple speakers] quarter.
Stephen Tusa: Okay. And then so if you're doing flat in the second quarter to get to 3%, the midpoint of the range organic, it looks like you have to do something in the 7% range in the second half of the year. You mentioned mid-single digits as a tweener. I think some companies we cover would round that up to high single digits to make it look better. But for you guys you're a little more conservative with your messaging. Is that the right math we're talking about? Do you think there's a chance you're in the 7% range in the second half? 
Brian Jellison: That’s the high end of our guidance absolutely.
Stephen Tusa:
O:
of :
 guidance. :
Brian Jellison: If you go to the 4% you’re absolutely right on the math. So kind of we’re at the midpoint, it’s closer to the 6% range for the second half.
Stephen Tusa: Okay. Got it. Thanks. Sorry, one more on Neptune, sorry about that, more detail. What was the debooking there? I haven't heard that term that you guys have used before.
John Humphrey: We didn’t have any fee booking at that time. That was in radio frequency software where we had a situation in the UK that we really decided with all parties would we better if they did something other than what they were asking us to do. So we debooked a couple of million dollars in the quarter.
Stephen Tusa: And that comes through in orders obviously. But that's reflected in your orders number or is that adjusted out?
Brian Jellison: Yes. That’s right. 
Stephen Tusa: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Robert P McCarthy with Stifel.
Robert McCarthy: Following up on some of these questions that have been raised, the second half organic growth outlook, are you going to have a better sense on the 2Q call what the adoption rates are going to be that drive the variability in your guidance, or is it not something you're going to know until mid 3Q?
Brian Jellison: Better view on the tolling project we’ll have a widely different view on product launches, little bit in the medical products, a little less so on the software version update. But I think maybe you want to think about the fact, we saw we have this sort of artificial, we thought it is real, but we have a 3% to 4% organic drag because in Puerto Rico that goes away right Toronto goes away. So, so many things go away in the segments and they wind up with, if they were growing 3% to 4% organically, some are already growing 3% organically they are just. 
Robert McCarthy: Right. And my only question is, can you declare victory one way or the other on the guide when you report in July, or is it still going to be unclear, is my question.
John Humphrey: We never declare victory until the game is over?
Robert McCarthy: Or you do a big deal. Now, moving on to the restructuring, obviously that's something to be applauded. You do a lot of restructuring. It flows through numbers. Do you have a size across the segments or any flavor we can give? Obviously the returns are incredibly high in terms of what you do. But anything around the narrative around restructuring that would be helpful?
Brian Jellison: All the restructuring is centered around the oil and gas businesses and so a substantial amount of that is Roper pump which is virtually all off -- not, almost all upstream and has just collapsed. I mean it takes your breath away if you look at the numbers in the first quarter of ’14 versus here. So, we’ve done quite a bit of restructuring there and we’ve done some restructuring at compressor controls and we’ll continue to do more because their underlying service revenue will continue to be good and even grow. Plus the project activity around Compressor Controls will be off quite substantially. So Q2, I’m going to guess $2 million additional as some of these European things finally come to bore. Be less than 3 million or 4 million in the last six months I’d say.
John Humphrey : And to put a little bit of more context on this. If you look at the number of people and industrial technology is down 10% more it was last year, saying first quarter this year versus first quarter last year. And then our energy segment it’s down, I think 7% or 8%. So our costs unlike most other companies, our cost or people related. We never like to brag about having to reduce people, but when volume goes down, it’s a necessary part of the retrenchment process. And so to put a little bit of contacts around that right, we’ll take big restructuring charges that cost a lot of cash, so you have to close down factories or take out capacity. But we have had quite a substantial reduction in the number of people, who workforce in those two segments.
Brian Jellison: And Robert where you really see it, look at the detrimental margins and energy and you can see that they’re dramatically lower than the gross margin. So people really do a great job and find tuning things.
Robert McCarthy: The last question would be just around the portfolio. This has been asked before so it's not exactly novel. But would you consider just separating into two companies, just allowing -- obviously taking the playbook of a noted competitor and then thinking about pursuing the higher growth opportunities? Do you think there's any crowd-out there that hurts the businesses that perhaps don't have quite the characteristics that your best businesses have?
Brian Jellison: Well, the reality is that, if you look at the industrial and energy businesses, they just have outstanding independent results, right. So they’ve been kind of consolidated businesses with 30% EBITDA. They get all the internal investment they need and they throw off positive cash. So our view on that at least for now is good brief. I mean, why wouldn’t you want to have a portfolio that you could deploy all of your cash into the highest possible returning businesses. So why keep the capital deployment model by forcing to invest in businesses with inherently lower returns than the technology businesses with inherently higher returns, it just doesn’t make any sense for our investors. From an investor view point, if you split the industrial and energy, you’re going to redeploy cash and stuff that produces dramatically lower returns than the high stuff, I don’t know why investors would like us for doing that.
Robert McCarthy: Thanks for your time.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Good morning. Brian, just wondering if, as it sounded, perhaps you're foreshadowing that Roper will switch to a cash-based preamortization earnings model. 
Brian Jellison: Well, I don’t think so. We’ll continue to watch what people say about that. There is GAAP really does distort a lot of things around cash. So I think we’re content with showing people what the GAAP number is and what the non-GAAP number is. This particular year though, because all acquisitions come in, the loss of non-cash amortization. So it doesn’t show up in operating profit, it distorts the number. So we want to have people understand that things are absolutely fine here. But we haven’t gone to the point of saying, well here is what the cash earnings are, here is our share count and that’s the earnings, cash earnings per share basis.
Christopher Glynn: Okay.
Brian Jellison: We think investors are smart enough to figure that out.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And then perhaps another area where there's a little distortion from the sales of the acquired businesses. You talked about the added amortization component of SG&A but that was up a lot, too. Is that an area to whittle away at the deals and that contribution on SG&A to sales? Or is your comment on ramping up RD&E a more important thought there?
Brian Jellison: I’m not sure we understand that question Chris. So there is a lot of happens. When you do an acquisition, say you do a $1 billion acquisition. You’re going to have 2.5% or 3% or maybe more of the purchase price filling into non-cash amortization. So if you deploy a $1 billion are going to have all that cash deployment that’s gone into something never coming back, it’s not like capital reinvest that’s continued to reinvesting and the depreciation is a call in the future. So that non-cash amortization on the billion might be $30 million. So it shows up in GAAP as a reduction in operating profit, when in reality it’s an increasing cash earnings. So that’s all we’re talking about.
Christopher Glynn: Right. Yes, I guess I worded my question poorly. But even independent of the 120 basis points you called out, SG&A to sales was still up a good bit, so I was just wondering.
Brian Jellison: We’re absolutely investing in product management. I mean, just like we said R&D is up 120 basis points. Our sales investments and product management they’re excelling, they’re probably up another 110 basis points. That isn’t going to change. We’re going to continue drive for long-term growth.
John Humphrey: And as we continue to really become much more of a technology company as oppose to manufacturing company. SG&A is that’s where our value add is for customers. It’s not really in the cost of goods sold line. It’s about whether you’re able to machine the widget more efficiently than the next guy. If the intellectual capital which is inherent in the Research & Development, it’s in the engineering, it’s in the customer support and customer application people, show up as G&A. But those are value added resources for us. And as we continue to be more of a technology company, that’s how our P&L will continue to look like with less cost of goods sold and more on the SG&A side. Not as a cost to be reduced, but as an investment in the value producing parts of our enterprise.
Christopher Glynn: Perfect. Got it. Thanks.
Operator: And now we’ll end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Thank you and thank you all for joining us this morning. And we look forward to talking to you again in July.
Operator: And that does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

We have prepared slides to accompany today’s call, which are available through the webcast, and also on our website. Now, if you turn to slide two, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today’s call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today’s call in the context of that information. Next slide: Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our website. For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of three items: First, we completed the divestiture of Abel Pumps during the fourth quarter, resulting in a pre-tax book gain of $70.9 million; this was partially offset by an impairment charge of $9.5 million relating to an imaging investment we made in 2007. Second, a $4 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions made in 2015. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized if not for our acquisition. Finally, we have a $2.6 million inventory step-up expense relating to the acquisition of RF Ideas. Now, if you please turn to slide four, I’ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. And after his remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: Thank you, John. Good morning everyone. So, we’ll start off here with our Q4 results. They were flat to last year; we talk a little bit about that. At $948 million, it’s exactly the same number as last year, but there is a lot of activity to get you there. We had another 2 points of FX headwind in the quarter and then the acquisitions net of the Abel divestiture offset the organic shortfall in Energy primarily. The industrial and energy markets declined in the fourth quarter and really had less seasonal adjustment favorably in the fourth quarter than normally, and we’ll talk about that when we get to that segment. But we had very strong growth in Medical and the RF segments. Our gross margins continued to escalate; they were up 190 basis points in the quarter to 61.8%. Our EBITDA margin also hit 35.9%, that’s the EBITDA margin, not the gross margin. And EBITDA was up another 2% to $341 million, which is sort of an annualized run rate of $1,364 million. Our free cash flow was up to $261 million and is 140% cash conversion. And we also issued 5 and 10-year bond, which totaled $900 million in the month of December and deployed over $700 million in the quarter and some very attractive acquisitions. So, we enjoyed both, good execution in the quarter and terrific disciplined capital deployment. Next slide: If we look at the income statement in the quarter, you can see that while the orders and the revenue were exactly the same as a year ago, no two businesses would have been the same. So, this was a case of watching the ducks on the pond, but a whole lot of paddling going on underneath it. The book-to- bill at 0.98 is actually pretty good for a fourth quarter. Just to give you some sense of history, in 2011, our book-to- bill in the fourth quarter was 0.94; in 2012, it was 0.95; and in 2013, it was a flat 1 or 1.01; and ‘14 was 0.98; and this year was 0.98. So from a historical perspective, it’s about what we would expect to see. Our gross profit, as we said, was up 59.9% to 61.8%. And operating income, the margin was 30.1% and that absorbed 70 basis points of higher non-cash amortizations as acquisitions came in. The interest expense was up $5 million due to the bond issuance and a little bit more drawn at the revolver during the quarter. Net earnings were down 1% from a $187 million to $186 million, which you could see just from the interest. Next slide: Here we shift into the full year enterprise results, so next slide. On the enterprise results, the whole point of the year really was our ability to demonstrate nimble execution in the field and then deploy capital in really a top acquisition market with great transactions. So, if you look at the records, everything once again was a record. We had the most orders, the highest revenue, the best margins, the highest net earnings, and the best EBITDA and cash flow of any year in our history. The growth was led by Medical and RF. We had continued margin improvement through the year. The gross margin was up a 140 basis points on a year to 60.7, and the operating margin was up 80 basis points to 29% operating profit margin, and of course EBITDA was higher. A very strong cash flow, we were up 11% in cash flow for the year, and that was 26% of revenue. Our cash flow was also up 11%. And our cash conversion on a free cash flow basis was 132%. We deployed a $1.8 billion in acquisitions in 2015 with almost entirely a focus on software and medical technologies. All of our acquisitions are really very high margin businesses; they are all asset light; they’re very specific leaders in niche markets; and they have high recurring revenue and strong management teams at each one of these companies that we acquired. And on our recent acquisitions have been growing in excess of 10% a year which gives us as they become organic rather acquisitions, a benefit to our organic notes. Next slide: If we look at this bridge, we put together I think really help people understand about the performance in the forward nature of what we’ll do in 2016. If you look at the base revenue in 2015, it was $3,552 million and it ended the year $3,593 million but that’s not the story, being up 1%. The story is that we had organic growth in our RF segment; we had organic growth in Medical; and we had substantial acquisitions, even though we divested Abel, which was $20 million plus revenue business. So, those three components added 7% to our trailing revenue number of last year. But we had a 3% currency headwind, almost all of which was in the Energy and Industrial segments. And that 3% brought the number down and then we had $35 million of negative organic growth in Industrial, almost all of which was in Roper and FTI which are our upstream fluid handling businesses. And then we had $72 million negative organic in Energy, the vast the majority of which was again upstream, although in the fourth quarter, we didn’t get the seasonal push that we normally would get. So, we had a little bit of fall off in the fourth quarter in the mid and downstream business. So, about 2.5% of the 3% negative organic in Industrial and Energy was related directly to oil and gas. Also, something that gets us obscured a bit by the numbers is our organic growth in the first quarter of ‘15 was 6%, excluding oil and gas. And we actually grew 2% in the second, third and fourth quarter excluding oil and gas. So, those headwinds that we had to contend with in 2015 around oil and gas markets will be dramatically smaller in 2016 than they were this year, although there is still some real challenges. And the currency isn’t going to be $104 million; it will be probably 80% less than that negative number. Next slide: If we look at the outstanding margins, you can see on the left hand side the gross margins in 2013, we were at 58.6, and those were raised 70 basis points in ‘14 and then raised twice that a 140 basis points this year to 60.7. And our EBITDA margins in 2013 were 32.8; they were raised 100 basis points in ‘14 to 33.8 and another 80 basis points this year to 34.6. So, the continued margin expansion just comes really from a focus on our asset light businesses, being able to reinvest for growth for and themselves and we had great leverage throughout the enterprise, as a result. Next slide: To get to really what’s the core of our entire business model is compounding our cash flow. And this compounding you can see continues to be outstanding in a year where we really only had 1% revenue growth. Our free cash flow is up 11%; our free cash flow at $929 million is up $89 million from the $840 million. So, we had a great quarter in the fourth quarter with $269 million in cash but we had a terrific year with $893 million in cash, in our view still the best major performance. If you look at our cash guidance, you’ll see our cash guidance tells a different story than the EPS guidance. Next slide: If you look at the financial position of the Company, here you can see cash at the end of this past year closed down at $779 million, up from $610 million a year before and up from $460 million in 2013. Now, we’ve deployed almost a third of that here in January to close the CliniSys acquisition which is a little bit over $250 million, and that happened in the month of January. We also upsized our revolver; our revolver use to be $1,500 million, our revolver is now $1,850 million, and you can see on our undrawn revolver, we have 1,670 million. So between cash and undrawn revolver is about $2.5 billion of powder there. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA 1,250 million of course will be -- that’s not a pro forma number and it will continue to get bigger as the year goes on. But even at 1,245 million, our net debt to EBITDA is only 2; at the end of ‘13, it was 1.9. So, we’ve done over a couple of billion dollars of acquisitions and only have net debt of about $500 million. So, we still have a great deal of ample liquidity to do anything we want to do in the acquisition front in 2016. Next slide: Here we will start to look at the specific segment detail and outlook. Next slide: If we look at the four segments, the Energy segment; the Industrial; the RF; and the Medical segment, you will see that they all are -- performed phenomenally from an EBITDA and gross margin basis. So, even though you have a year where Energy and Industrial together came in at $1,333 million, which was down 12% from the prior year’s 1,519 million, they still delivered 31% EBITDA margins in both years and both were over 50% in gross margins. In our RF and Medical space, those guys were up 11% from $2 billion roughly to $2.260 billion and of course they have even stronger margins with 36% EBITDA for RF and 45% EBITDA for Medical. And the Medical and the RF businesses are now already 70% of our total EBITDA, even though all the segments have extraordinary margins. Next slide: So, we will start first with Medical which is our largest segment. And here you can see in the quarter we had organic revenue of plus 3%, acquisitions of plus 12% and foreign exchange a negative 3%. The SHP and IPA acquisitions from ‘14 finally went to organic, and they delivered double-digit growth for us in this quarter. We had very strong sales out of nearly double digit with new product launches that we had talked about earlier in the year continuing to gain tracking. And our Northern Digital business had an outstanding year, were up more than 10% with very strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Atlas Medical which is small acquisition that we bolted into Sunquest in the fourth quarter, its integration activity is doing well and we expect that to contribute in 2016. And I’d say, we should comment on completed all-time record year is just compounding their growth and everything going well in that arena. In 2016 the way we see the year unfolding is that we will continue to be nimble. And when I say our operating leverage for the full year in Medical was 50%, so as these grow, they contribute outsized incremental gains for us. We think we will have mid-single digit organic growth in Medical throughout ‘16 and we think that will get stronger as the year goes on. Sunquest has a number of version changes and software release updates that are rolling out in the second half that will be quite beneficial. And then Strata, Data Innovations and SoftWriters which are growing rapidly, will become organic in the second half. Verathon and Northern Digital are going to continue to grow at a relatively high rate in ‘16. And then we closed on January 7th, the CliniSys acquisition in the UK which is European hospital laboratory software provider and it will add to our acquisition sales growth in 2016. Next slide: Here we look at RF Technology. And RF Technology was up in the fourth quarter 4% organically and had a negative FX of a point and acquisitions and divestitures added 15%. So, their revenue was up 18%, operating profit up 30%, and the operating profit margin 31.1%. Software throughout the segment performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter, as we returned to pretty good growth at iTrade and double-digit growth of Freight Matching. Aderant was acquired in October and it’s off to a great start with the Aderant team. And in fact some of us are working with them in terms of coordinating some of large clients, being more secure going in with Aderant in the future as opposed to the fact that they were run by private equity in the past. Toll and traffic projects are progressing really quite well, Riyadh is doing alright, although the startups in traffic in Riyadh tend to be a more civil engineering at the beginning, before we get all the software revenue, but they’re still fine. And our Infinity Lanes that we’ve been rolling out in Florida and Texas are on schedule and contributing substantially. We think we’ll have mid-single-digit organic growth for the year with stronger growth in the second half for RF, primarily because TransCore is finally out of an arrangement where we were providing tolling administration in Puerto Rico, and that’s been quite a challenge in last half of this past year and will be completely out of our business model this year. So, it’s a little bit dilutive to our revenue, but it’s very much accretive to our sanity as trying to get money out of Puerto Rico as you know is not an easy task. But that will put a drag on revenue in the first two quarters about 10 million bucks each quarter, but that’s revenue we’re happy to avoid. Our operating leverage for the segment by the way in 2015 was up 56%. So, here again as we get incremental revenue and we expect to have that in 2016, you’ll see continued margin enhancement. The software businesses, we think will grow at kind of mid-single-digits, but they do have exceptional margins that allow us to use cash to reinvest in other transactions. And then the recent acquisitions that we’ve had Aderant, RF Ideas and On Center are all growing at a pretty strong rate and they have excellent cash flow performance and eventually they too will become organic. Next slide: If we look at Industrial Technology, here in the fourth quarter, organic revenue was down 8%. It’s all pretty much all oil and gas upstream with our businesses that are related to that. To get some context about this, in 2014, the oil and gas portion of Industrial Technology was about 12% of revenue and unlike RF where it’s zero and Medical where it’s zero. And Industrial Tech was 12% ‘14, and this year that dropped down to 9% of revenue; and in our forecast for ‘16, we think it will be down about 6% of revenue in the segment. It’s almost exclusively upstream activity for surface and water pumping projects. We also had the divestiture which came full circle with Abel with about in the low-20s of revenue that contributed nothing in the fourth quarter of this year, and of course will be out all of next year. Neptune grew really quite well double-digit growth in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. The Toronto project was still there as a headwind as we told last year, it’s closed to 10 million a quarter. But it finally sunsets in the first quarter of next year. So, Neptune’s growth in 2016 will be outsized compared to the way it has looked with the Toronto headwind in the past. We’re forecasting continuing declines really in the upstream oil and gas. It was off about 30% for 2015 and we think it will be off another 30% in 2016, but of course it gets to be down to a smaller number. So, it’s about a $20 million headwind for the segment going into 2016. And the rest of the businesses we think will grow at kind of low-single-digit numbers, maybe a little bit better than that. So we go to the next slide. I should say that OP leverage and Industrial for the year, it deleveraged 40%. So with gross margins about 50 and delevering at 40, we think that was pretty good performance. Next slide: On Energy Systems & Controls, they had this continued fall off, as one would expect, particularly in the upstream arena. Their operating leveraging for 2015 though was really quite good, negative 39% and their gross margins were 58%. So, I think everybody performed quite nimbly, although in the fourth quarter Compressor Controls started to see really deep dive on their project work and hadn’t really restructured around that yet, and that activity will happen here in the first quarter. So, they contributed terrifically over the last several years but are going to have to face the reality of a major decline in project work. It’s not going to reoccur for some long period of time. Now, in the quarter, organic growth then was off as you can see 17%, FX by 4%. Our seasonal improvement actually did occur sort of as we forecasted, just not quite as much. We were up 9% seasonally in the fourth quarter energy, but normally were up kind of 17% to 20% and occasionally 25% in the fourth quarter. So, we had thought we’d be up maybe 15% in the fourth quarter and by only coming up that kind of pulled back our revenue tad in the fourth quarter which was direct result of being little less revenue than we expected out of that. Certainly, backlogs are reduced in the segment, and that oil and gas project businesses are kind of rapidly deteriorate, although that’s not a surprise. The unbelievable growth in Zetec as both South Korea and Japan and Middle East are roaring back and in fact we are up quite dramatically in Zetec and we think that will accrete to very strong performance for Zetec in 2016. The operating margin which really speaks to the nimbleness of the operating people we have in these businesses was still 32.7%, even though the segment was down substantially in revenue. As we look at what we are talking here for 2016, you can see sort of high single-digit organic decline for the segment; oil and gas we think will be down about 15%, which will be about $50 million drag on the settlement, so about $20 million out of is Industrial and about $50 out of Energy. The project activity is going to be force Compressor Controls to do some aggressive restructuring. And I know that it’s a challenge for everybody but there is no question, the market requires us to do that. And then we think we’ll have modest growth in the rest of the areas in the industrial and nuclear arena. Next slide: So, here is we get into the 2016 guidance. Next slide: We created another bridge for you here for 2016, so you get a sense of what’s really going on and the health of the overall business. You can see, we finished this last year ‘15 at $3,593 million. We expect revenue to be up between 8% to 10% in 2016 and we think organic revenue will be between 2% and 4% in the coming year. So, we’ll get mid single-digits organic growth out of RF and mid single-digit organic growth out of Medical. I think we’ll have a low single-digit organic growth out of Industrial whereas last year you might remember, it was negative number. And then already completed acquisitions net of the Abel divestiture are going to contribute sizeable portion of revenue in 2016. We think we’ll still have the high single-digit organic drop in Energy but that’s a big improvement over last year’s organic drop. And in foreign exchange which was a $104 million last year is probably going to be about 80% less headwind for us in 2016, so maybe something in the $20 million to $25 million arena. And that makes just as we showed you, we grew last year’s 7% until you hit the oil and gas number. Just easier comps throughout the year for us once we get past the first quarter. Next slide: So, if we look at the 2016 guidance, you can see for the full year, we’re saying operating cash flow, we would hope would meet or exceeded $1 billion. And operating cash flow is going to have just a very limited CapEx drag for it to convert to free cash flow. This past year, I think CapEx was $36 million; we wouldn’t expect it to be any higher than that this year; so, certainly less than 1% of revenue, probably quite a bit less than 1% of revenue. Full-year adjusted DEPS we’re saying are $6.85 to $7.15. And the key assumptions around that is we get for the full year revenue growth of 8% to 10%, organic growth of 2% to 4%, comps ease after the first quarter, and in the first quarter we’ve got a lot of headwinds. So, we’ve got revenue drag out of Puerto Rico, we’ve got oil and gas had not really hit us in the first quarter of last year, and then we had some unique revenue coming out of Roper Pump; that won’t continue, and we’ve got little higher interest cost because of the bigger drop with acquisitions but we also get benefit in earnings. But Q1 last year at 6% organic and the last three quarters had 2% organic, so we certainly don’t expect 6% organic net of oil and gas in the first quarter. Our non-cash amortization increases by $30 million, so our non-cash amortization will be a $195 million in 2016. And if you want to use cash earnings, you can add that back to the net earnings number. Interest expense is about $25 million higher than last year to $109 million. Our tax rate is going to be somewhat similar to this past year in the 30% to 30.5% arena. And of course none of these includes any new acquisitions and we do expect to be pretty active in 2016 and add in additional high quality businesses. In the first quarter we are going to establish guidance at $1.42 to $1.47 because of those things that we have to face in the first quarter that what were not at the end of last year. But we’ll get improvements throughout the year on those things with quite dramatic improvement in the second half, which is not based on hope but just the reality of when we know to be the case. Next slide: As we look at 2015 summary and then the outlook for the year, we delivered record annual results for orders and revenue and margin and net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow in ‘15 and that was despite probably the biggest headwind period we had with so much coming from currency and oil and gas. Our operating cash flow was up 11%, free cash flow also up 11%. We had terrific margin improvement with gross margins up 140 basis points to 60.7%. EBITDA margin is up 80 basis points to 34.6%. And free cash flow at $893 million represented 25% of every dollar of our revenue and 132% cash conversion versus the DEPS number. We deployed $1.8 billion in really attractive acquisitions and we increased our dividend by 20%. As we go into this year, we expect to deliver record performance in ‘16 with that revenue growth we mentioned just the slide before, 8% to 10%; operating cash flow around $1 billion. We think we’ll deploy well over $1 billion in acquisitions that can easily be higher than that. And we’ve already closed our first one with CliniSys for about $250 million in January. We’ve got a very attractive pipeline. We are looking at a transaction on Friday and another one on Monday. And so, there is just a great deal of activity going on, probably the most that we have ever seen in terms of pipeline. We continue to compound cash, increased shareholder value last year, you got a lot of alpha [ph] off us in 2015. And we’re just going to think we can continue to increase our cash as we look at 2016. So with that John, I think we are ready for questions.
John Humphrey: I think so. So Diana, we are ready for the Q&A portion of our call.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instruction] Now, we will take our first question from Shannon O’Callaghan of UBS.
Shannon O’Callaghan: Brain, just on the assumptions on the oil and gas of the down 30 for Industrial Tech, and down 15 for Energy, maybe just explain a little bit more the differences between those two decline rates, and then some of the other businesses around the oil and gas stuff within the energy segment that you have a better outlook for.
Brian Jellison: Well, in industrial, basically Roper Pump is almost exclusively oriented around upstream oil and gas. So, it’s not a huge business but it has a big, big drawback when you have change in tracking and it’s primarily U.S. business. So, if oil and gas component was down 30% in ‘15 from ‘14 and we expect it will be down another 30% in ‘16 ‘15, but it’s still fairly small number. So, it’s about $20 million revenue drag that we’re modeling into ‘16. None of the other businesses in Industrial Technology have anything to do with oil and gas. They’re instrument companies or over half is the Neptune and water meter business which is going to grow next year. So, it’s just that one isolated. And there is no midstream and downstream activity really in Industrial. When you get into Energy much, much bigger total dollars of what you are talking about, about 60% of the segment is oil and gas, but only some of it is upstream, primarily upstream portion or couple of very small businesses, Viatran and little bit of Amont [ph] and then quite a lot of Compressor Controls. So, Compressor Controls has been living off of a great project backlog. Their service work we expect could be a record this year in 2016, but we think their project work will drop really dramatically, it could drop $30 million to $40 million. And the midstream and downstream activity for the year has been really decent all the way along; the only drag has been the currency. But then in the fourth quarter, we didn’t get as much of a seasonal uptick in those downstream businesses as we normally do, so mostly testing businesses. So that bodes for slight deterioration, probably in ‘16. The rest of the Energy businesses, the 40% are really mostly test and measurement kind of businesses and then were up really sharply at Zetec. So that helps offset -- that’s we are saying 15% for Energy but it’s 30% for the upstream portion of Industrial.
Shannon O’Callaghan: And then within Industrial in terms of getting from organic declines to starting to grow there again, what is the Toronto comp impact; what was it in 4Q; what is it in 1Q? And then what’s driving that double-digit Neptune growth; I mean is that kind of a sustainable rate or what’s the…
Brian Jellison: It’s certainly going to be very solid growth in 2016. It’s about $10 million dividend [ph] each quarter for the Toronto project as it’s fell off. There is a little bit of revenue we are still getting out of Toronto for last minute adjustments but it’s not very meaningful. It’s just domestic growth in commercial water meters and new wins in projects. We are going to have some -- I mean we are having share gains that are really obvious to us when we look at the data and we are going to have further share gains in 2016 that we are confident of based on all of our contacts and with our bid process.
John Humphrey: Yes. Shannon, Toronto project really completed substantially in the first quarter of 2015. So, it’s still kind of in that $10 million comp range in the fourth quarter against the fourth of ‘14 and it will have a little bit of a headwind in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. But then after that it’s going to be more normalized. So it’s not an acceleration that we’re looking for; it’s really some headwinds that start to go away.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: I’d like to go back on to the oil exposures for Industrial and Energy, and just talk about if you could your visibility in the businesses, specifically around orders in the quarter. And then on the organic assume declines; maybe discuss what volume versus pricing. There is a lot of supplier squeezing that’s going on in the sector and wouldn’t be surprised to see if you’re seeing some pricing pressure as well.
Brian Jellison: Well, if you talk of ourselves, I’ll tell you it’s massive pricing, but there is no pricing pressure. That’s not the issue at all, just pure -- the biggest component of course is currency, but then from a unit situation, it’s the project work at Compressor Controls this year. It’s really easy to detail that out. So, those numbers are pretty good. Last year, we actually said when we initiated guidance, we thought upstream would be down about 20%. You correctly challenged us about CapEx is down 30, might it not be down 30, and we said well it could be down more than 20, but we thought we had a particular arrangement around surface drilling, which is new technology, which has rapidly gained share and it was doing that at the time and we thought that would continue in the second quarter. But in the second quarter, they basically stopped all ordering and consumed all inventory they could and that hurt us a little bit. And then in the fourth quarter, we didn’t get any seasonal bounce -- well we did, but not as much as normally would. So, we’re very comfortable around guiding down 20 million on oil and gas, and industrial and around 50 million in energy. I think that’s quite correct. And then, there would still be a little bit more drag on a nominal number basis with currency, but it’s definitely not pricing. And the guys have been pretty correct, all year along except for that Q2 situation Roper Pump where our supply agreement got suspended for that quarter.
Deane Dray: What were orders in the quarter for both?
Brian Jellison: The segment book-to-bill was like 0.88 for energy in the fourth quarter.
John Humphrey: And it was 0.97 for industrial. So on the industrial side that 0.97 is the kind of typical for a fourth quarter, but it’s definitely wider. So you asked about visibility also. So for the products businesses, particularly around upstream and even on the mid – downstream, those are generally going to be book and ship inside of a relatively short window, two months or so. Where we do have better visibility and where we’re talking more about this is on the Compressor Controls, right because it’s more of a project business and that’s where we saw an order shortfall in the fourth quarter leading to that 0.9 book-to-bill area, and why we’re expecting that to be a tough year for the project based business, because we have good visibility in that area.
Deane Dray : Brian, your referenced back in the second quarter some of our expectations that upstream could be worse. Just to kind of give you a data point, we had launch on Friday with the CEO of Schlumberger and their expectations is upstream could be down 35%. So, we’re in that right neighborhood. And just last question for me would be these businesses, so we talk about Roper Pumps or Compressor Controls; these are legacy Roper Industries businesses and certainly not something that you would be looking to invest in today. Now, in the teeth of the oil pressures here, certainly not a time to talk about divesting, but would there be an opportunity at some point to separate the Roper Industry legacy businesses from Roper Technologies, where you’re focusing today?
Brian Jellison: It’s certainly possible; we talk about it quite a lot. And there are a lot of different avenues for achieving that. It could be spun off as an independent entity where people would be able to make kind of one-for-one decision about whether they wanted to be in that space as an investor and it could be put together with another business and some kind of merger. Again, it’s not something we would likely sell, because the tax [indiscernible] sale is just pretty prohibitive. And the businesses are very good. I mean the oil and gas businesses, we put the whole thing together, and they have an EBITDA margin of 34%. And they don’t take a lot of assets; they are very, very cash accretive to our number. And for those people who like EPS, they give us terrific EPS, because there is no amortization. But you’re right. I mean it’s something we’re always going to look at. And certainly there have been more than one phone call in-bound about people who like to do something, but selling them is not the best thing for our investors, finding tax free alternative to that would be more attractive.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Joe Giordano at Cowen & Company.
Joe Giordano: So, what I’ve been trying to get with everyone’s guidance is kind of separate how much is the progression throughout the year is, anticipating a market upturn like an underlying market upturn and how much is specific to the company as cadence of revenue that’s already in hand, orders that you already have in hand. So, how do you separate your expectations with better second half versus what you know and what you are hoping?
John Humphrey: It’s a whole lot more of what we know and what we hope. We don’t really have very many businesses, only one or two that have any tide at something that’s kind of a larger macro in the markets. The markets that we serve are so niche. They end up being more driven by our activity around new products or new software releases rather than hope for some macroeconomic recovery. We are not really expecting any of that; that’s not something that we try to forecast. It really doesn’t drive many of our businesses. But it’s not as simple as orders in hand because we really don’t have orders in hand for products or for activity that’s going to jump in the third quarter or fourth quarter. So, we’re not a projects type of E&C business like that. But it’s really around things that we know that we’re going to able to introduce to the niche markets that we serve and again new products growth in those areas.
Joe Giordano: And then as you look at your pipeline into 2016, what have you seen in terms I guess across the various sectors that you play in, and in terms of bid ask spreads and how they are moderating or how they are moving, which areas are looking increasingly more attractive or increasingly less so in terms of valuation?
John Humphrey: In terms of acquisitions?
Joe Giordano: Yes.
John Humphrey: The bid ask spread is wide, it’s always wide. We were able to deploy $1.8 billion last year and we’ve already got a quarter of $1 billion done now. So, we don’t anticipate any difficulty at all. I do think that the notes out today are interesting. So, there weren’t any IPOs in January. So, if you were a seller of private equity, you might continue to say whatever you think somebody is going to listen to. But the reality is their debt costs are going up and their active strategies are diminishing. We remain the best mid market acquirer of assets on the face of the earth. So, we are not going to have any difficulty in finding high quality businesses at rational prices.
Joe Giordano: At what point does it -- do you start looking -- you guys are ahead of getting away from some of these energy industrial type of applications into where you are with your medical businesses? At what point do you start to look opportunistically a little bit more aggressively at some of these sectors that have been down a little bit more?
John Humphrey: What we always look at is the cash return we can get out of an investment. And so what happens is it’s hugely difficult for an industrial asset to have the kind of cash returns that we are going to demand. But whenever we see them, we are willing to make investments in those. We bought a pure product company in RF Ideas this year which is just a world class business with terrific leadership, very high margins, relatively light assets but they are certainly making stuff and they are selling stuff. So, it depends on the quality of what it is we see. But we would never buy something at a public market deep discount. Let’s say some energy business dropped 30%, we wouldn’t buy something because it dropped 30%; we would only buy something because its forward cash returns were extremely attractive. And as generally as a rule, people overpay for low quality assets under the theory that they are going to find some way to make it better. So, we’ll leave the buying of distressed assets to others. We want to buy businesses that have consistent growth and recurring revenue and light assets models. And we haven’t seen any other than RF Ideas. We haven’t seen anything in the last two years in the Industrial segment that qualifies for that.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman: Brian, could you just speak for a minute or two to the medical segment in general? Again, given the ‘16 guidance, mid single-digit growth and the core order growth of 7% in the fourth quarter, it looks little attractive. Is there anything in the mix to be alert for in ‘16 between medical products and software and imaging when you are talking about mid single-digit growth either of those or any of those kind a leading core growth and could give us an upward bias on the margin line for medical?
Brian Jellison: It’s a good question. Sorry, I have to dissect it. Remember that in the medical and software, we have a huge amount of recurring revenue, right? So, the recurring revenue, it’s not going to grow by a higher number. So, when we say mid to high single-digit that has to be something that takes a whole segment into consideration. So, the product portion in the new software sales have to be higher than that in order to get the whole segment up to mid single-digits. I don’t think that there is any -- certainly Sunquest in the second half of the year should have outsized growth to what it had throughout 2015 because we had the meaningful use improvement in ‘14 and the beginning of ‘15 that is a comparative drag and that will go away as ‘16 matures. I don’t think there is really any particular driver we -- in the medical software -- in the software businesses and RF component, there some drivers that have had escalating growth. I don’t know John, if you want to add anything.
John Humphrey: No, I don’t think so. So, I think it really will be. We expect ‘16 to be led by more higher V [ph] on the medical product side with some continued new product introductions; we introduced some things at Verathon in the latter part of ‘15 so those start to really ramp up. We have other new products that are being introduced to the market as well, as well as continued growth around some image-guided surgery applications that Northern Digital continues to just perform phenomenally well on. And then as Brain mentioned, in the software and services side that’s kind of a mid-single digit grower anyway because of the huge amount of recurring revenue. And that’s what we expect in the latter part of ‘16. We are not expecting a whole lot of recovery at all in the imaging world. I think that’s expected to be flat to maybe up a little bit.
Richard Eastman: And then just one last question, John, when you kind of speak to ‘16 overall, again we -- we all have our estimates as to what acquisitions completed will contribute to the EBIT line. But on that 2% to 4% core growth, what’s just kind of a mid-point conversion rate that we should see on the 2% to 4% for the core business?
John Humphrey: Conversion, you mean like leverage?
Richard Eastman: Yes, to the EBIT line?
John Humphrey: It’s not a come up to your own, we expect that to be somewhere in the 40% to 50% range.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Robert McCarthy of Stifel.
Robert McCarthy: So, two questions, one is just kind of the old chestnut that people asked about Roper and M&A. And clearly, given the environment we are seeing, and I guess one of the cofounders of Apollo [ph] just talked about the financing markets shutting down and the sky is falling. But in terms of just coming back to that question, is there particular types of companies that you are kind of looking at now that really lend [ph] themselves to be acquirer in these environments for really there is a crowd out of traditional private equity and really you can kind of sweep in besides just normal, is there particular vertical or end market where you are really well-positioned or well-advantaged? And does this allow for bigger deals of size or of a certain deciles and shaking out this environment?
Brian Jellison: Well, it is certainly true that there -- on things that are relatively large in potential acquisitions, maybe there will be less competition for those assets as the year unfolds, than there have been in the last three years. I noticed on some of the large things that we looked at, if they get bought back private equity, it isn’t one fund, it’s three guys going together. But debt staples were still out there. I mean we are looking at a deal Friday that has a six and half times debt staple. So, as long as debt staples are that high and we wouldn’t use it, the private equity is going to use that. They can put in four turns at EBITDA and you are still 10.5 times EBITDA. So, that kind of businesses that we acquire, they were public, they tend to trade at 25 times enterprise value to EBITDA or more. I know it’s hard for people to follow that because they’re looking at traditional multi-industry stuff but multiples are dramatically less. So, we are going to continue look at these things are with a great deal from an arbitrage perspective in a public market versus what we have to pay for them. And those tend to crowd out the lesser quality businesses where people pay eight, nine 10 times for something that’s worth 10. And we tend to pay 11 and 12 times for something that’s worth 25 and that’s really how we get all this out for performance, consistently over a long period time and that’s going to continue. Last year we did something that I wouldn’t have forecast which is we did six or seven deals to get the $2 billion; we would have rather done $1.5 billion deal and a $500 million deal. But the small deals were unbelievably compelling and they are all growing double digits. So, I think it was a good thing to do. We are still seeing a lot of those kind of opportunities. So, as the year unfolds, it will be a battle between sort of saving our powder for really large transaction and we’re going ahead and investing early on things that are somewhat modest. At the end of the day for our shareholders, the result is about the same. It’s just easier for us to do a large deal than five small deals. But it should be an easy year for us to deploy capital, very favorable.
Robert McCarthy: And as a follow-up, I mean just obviously in ramping up coverage of you all again after a long dormancy. The cash return on investment kind of metric you use and kind of animates your M&A and capital redeployment strategy obviously makes a heck lot of sense. And I certainly have drunk the Kool-Aid with respect to the discipline around it. I think the most important epiphany coming out of it is basically the strategy and the metrics are kind of completely aligned. In another words, you don’t stretch for what is perceived as a strategic deal, because a strategic deal’s one which meets the metrics, right? So, I just the only question I have is, where do you think there are risks to the CRI discipline or maybe the businesses you’re looking at? Do you think it’s may be an assessment of the code? I know you use a third-party consultancy to kind of look at the -- kind of related intellectual property and software and association with deals, and there can be obviously risk there, can be risk of technological substitution. Maybe you just talk about where you just level headedly think about the risks in association with your capital redeployment strategy?
Brian Jellison: Well, let’s maybe just for a second, if we have think about risk in general, if you look at transactions, because people were asking questions about when we buy some cheap stuff. So, the cheap stuff in industrial and there is all kinds of stuff and their public stocks are going to continue to deteriorate, and you could buy them. Hey, what’s wrong with those as they can get working get disintermediated from distribution channels. They can wind up with the premium model out of Google on some bizarre thing; they wind up with Amazon selling past their competition at low-price point. So all kinds of things that happen, they desperately need absorption. So if revenue falls off, there is nothing they can do without big restructuring charges. When we get to our space, it’s really around whether or not the people in the niche that we acquire have domain expertise, which is very hard for somebody to break into. And so, the entry barriers for their success are entirely different. So, the risk is that we continue to assess the quality of the management teams that we acquire well and we understand whether or not there are technologies that could leapfrog what they do. So that we spent most of our time around the people aspects of the business and then around big risks that those people don’t see that we would put kind of a different factor on. We tend to discount their forward growth projections, because we don’t pay for synergies or forward growth, we only pay for what we think the business is going to deliver at the time of the acquisition. And that really puts a huge dampening effect on the risk that we might otherwise have. And we’ve been kind of blessed to be fortunate in that arena. But I think our disciplines are such because we actually start with somebody’s balance sheet and then we start with what it takes to run the business. We don’t do like what a private equity people do, they’ll buy a software company and they’ll mandate an immediate 10% reduction. One of the private equity firms out there actually goes in and does a listing up the highest pay people and they whack off the highest paid people and put new college guys and big salary reductions. And then that kind of hideous serious activity doesn’t manifest itself in the business for four or five years. So, you have to understand what each private equity groups business model is when you’re looking at the assets they hold and you’re acquiring it and I think we knew that better than anybody.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Just wondering, in medical here the product cycles in the devices seems to be coming on pretty well. I wondered Northern Digital, Verathon, you look at hose to be able to climb for double-digit rate at some point and are the product cycles that have been notable the past few quarters, is that sort of a couple of year dynamic do you think?
Brian Jellison: Yes, I do think so. What we’re really seeing out of Verathon is a refresh. So, it’s not a completely new product category, which actually reduces the risk for us. These are really upgrades and extensions of their existing live scope like in 2015 in BladderScan and 2016. So those are kind of a couple of year adoption rates that go on there. Northern Digital doesn’t have to get up to double-digits; they just have to continue double-digit growth. They’ve been growing at double-digits here for couple of years, as they’re really the leader in both the optical tracking as well as the electromagnetic tracking for computer assisted surgery applications. And those continue to just expand. Those applications just expand. And whenever there is new that an OEM customer wants to design, they always come back in Northern Digital because they’re the world leaders in that technology.
Christopher Glynn: And then just if there is any room left there, so wanted to expand on Rob’s question a little bit where you had a record year last year in deal flow and talked about I think record pipeline volume or breadth. Have you transitioned more kind of wholeheartedly to CRI and is increasingly tolerant definition of strategic part of the reason why your pipeline and your yield has kind of accelerated to somewhat unpredictable levels?
Brian Jellison: No, no. Let’s go back and think about with -- reason I said some time ago that the Sunquest and question MHA acquisitions were more transformational than the Neptune and TransCore transformations were. Because at Neptune we paid four times EBITDA of the enterprise in December of 2003 to acquire Neptune at what somebody probably thought was a high price for $500 million. The next year in 2004, we just paid about four times again the trailing revenue of the firm, 3.5 or something, for TransCore, 600 million. Well, neither one of those businesses have lend themselves to adding exciting bolt-on activities to them or giving new domain experience in an area that was easily widened. When you acquire a leading laboratory software provider in a world that’s going to have more and more laboratory instrument usage and will move to genomics in the immediate future, you have big upside ramp. When you have MHA with senior living and nursing homes and all the things around non-acute hospitalization shifts and demography, these things just give you all kinds of opportunity. Well good heavens, we have acquired now SoftWriters for MHA which is growing at double-digits, so it’s a terrific acquisition. We’ve been able to acquire CliniSys which we connect really with Sunquest. We acquired Data Innovations which is phenomenal company that guides all the instrumentation in the hospital into various systems and yet it’s part of Sunquest. So, that’s why we can look at these things which are somewhat synergistic at least in the marketplace or in the information technology side of them that we couldn’t do with the industrial and energy businesses.
Operator: That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Thank you. And thank you all for joining us. I know there were a couple of folks on line for follow up questions; we will get back to you as soon as we can. Otherwise, we’ll look forward to talking t everyone in three months, at the end of the first quarter.
Operator: That will conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-10-26 08:30:00) =====
Executives: John Humphrey - CFO Brian Jellison - Chairman, President and CEO
Analysts: Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets Scott Davis - Barclays Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird Joe Giordano - Cowen and Company
Operator: The Roper Technologies' Third Quarter 2015 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Wes, and thank you all for joining us this morning, as we discuss our third quarter results. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, Vice President of Planning and Investor Relations. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The Press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the web cast, and also on our web site at www.ropertech.com. So if you please turn to slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. Next slide? Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation available on our web site. For the third quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted, consists of purchase accounting adjustments. One, to acquire deferred revenue and our recent software acquisitions, that totals $2.2 million. In addition, we have an inventory step-up expense for RF IDeas of $2 million. As a reminder, these adjustments represent -- absent our acquisitions, those businesses would have been able to recognize their profitability and revenue. Now if you please turn the slide, I’ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and after his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. So we start here with our Q3 enterprise highlights. We had a record third quarter, which we thought, was significant, given sort of issues associated with the end markets and foreign currency. Our revenue actually was modestly up from last year at $886 million and our book-to-bill was 101 and above almost everywhere, with the exception of RF, which is of course project driven. Growth was led by Medical, which was up 12% in revenue and RF Technology, which was up 6% in revenue. The declines that we saw in industrial and energy were virtually exactly as we had modeled. FX was about a 3% headwind in the quarter, and that result was a bit of negative organic, as you can see it was about 2% with those industrial and energy headwinds. Gross margins were spectacular, they were up 130 basis points to 60.7% over last year, and even up sequentially from the second quarter. EBITDA margins were up 80 basis points to 34.4, both records. Net earnings were up 4% and our diluted earnings per share were $1.61 versus our guidance of $1.53 to $1.57. Our free cash flow was $220 million, which was up sharply from the second quarter's $162 million and the $220 million of free cash flow represents 137% conversion. We deployed $435 million in three acquisitions, RF Ideas, Atlantic Health Partners and On Center, which we have discussed earlier, and we just completed the Aderant acquisition on Wednesday, which was $675 million net of tax benefit acquisition, we will talk more about this morning, and today we are announcing two more transactions, CliniSys and Atlas Medical. So it was really an outstanding quarter and of course great capital deployment for us.  Next slide; if you look at the income statement, we are sort of laughing, because it’s the old story about the ducks on the pond and they are moving along nicely, but underneath, these are moving wildly. Lots of activity, but at the end of the day, we are up $1 million, but you got to know, that that's in the face of oil and gas being down about 3% of our entire revenue, and FX about 3% and of course, the City of Toronto roll-up, another one, so we had to overcome quite a bit of headwinds and still produce positive results. Our gross margin was up from 59.4 a year ago to 60.7 and it really demonstrates the quality of our businesses, because even in these difficult markets, they not only are holding our gross margins, but oftentimes, increasing them. If you look at the operating margin, it too shows incredible execution, 27.9% a year ago and 28.7% this year, up 80 basis points, despite having quite a bit of M&A expense we took in during the quarter for all this activity. You can see that tax rate was 30.4, which was a little bit lower than last year's 31.3, but I'd remind you, our second quarter it was only 25.7, so there was a $0.12 headwind relative to Q2 on the tax rate, and the tax rate gives about $0.02 favorable in the quarter. And then you can see the DEPS at $1.61. The compounding of cash flow, if there is any theme around here, it would be that. We are in base, a compounder. You can see our cash flow -- operating cash flow is going up from $579 million during the first three quarters of last year, at $660 million now. Operating cash flow conversion was 141%. Our free cash flow conversion was 137%, and while we always ask people to look at, even though we don't report on a cash earnings per share basis, if you take a look here at our revenue, free cash flow, you will see that 25% of our revenue turned into free cash flow in the quarter. Our year-to-date free cash flow is up 15% over last year at $632 million, and we still do think cash is the best measure relative to performance. We continue to look at the balance sheet and our asset velocity. You will see that, we have improved another 160 basis points from the third quarter of 2014 through the third quarter of this year. Everything is better, inventory is down, receivables are down, payables are up, and so the net effect as we go from 5.8% at the end of the third quarter last year to 4.2% now and our governance process just continues to drive the working capital focus for every one here throughout the unit. Next slide; we look at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with very strong balance sheet. We had $700 million in cash, while its outside of the U.S. of course, an undrawn revolver, giving us sort of cash and undrawn revolver capacity of about $1.6 billion, and our gross net number you can see there is at about $2.8 billion. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is about $1.239 billion, that's not pro forma, that's just the actual number, pro forma would be higher, of course with our acquisitions, giving us a gross debt-to-EBITDA profile of about 2.3. Our pipeline opportunities are still really quite good, so we are going to continue to see acquisitions flowing here in 2016. We are rapidly getting to the point, where we are going to have $1 billion of cash flow very soon on an annual basis, and of course, we tend to reinvest that at about 1.3 or 1.5 times that cash flow. So we still look forward to another $1.5 billion or so of investment opportunity next year. The Aderant transaction of course is going to be around $695 million in terms of the cash cost of that, so that will take up the rest of our revolver, and as a result, we have upsized the revolver from its $1.5 billion to $1.850 billion, and the CliniSys transaction will be basically funded out of non-U.S. cash, so there is no new borrowing required. So it gives us a very strong balance sheet. Here we just have a placeholder before we start talking about our segment deal and the outlook. Next slide; if you look at the performance of all four of the segments, they continue to be just marvelous. I mean, here you are with these headwinds and currency challenges and everything else in energy, and yet our EBITDA margins in the quarter were 33%. Our Industrial Technology, which is only about 10% effective by oil and gas, still had 31% EBITDA margins, while RF had 36% and Medical 45. So all of these segments have just incredible margins, and if you think about it from a historical perspective, going back to look, just to 2011, not very long ago, our collective EBITDA is up about 580 basis points since the third quarter of 2011. And also, you want to remember, when we report EBITDA, almost all of our D&A is really just non-cash amortization, and unlike depreciation, that non-cash amortization has no call on future capital spending. Also, you can see Medical and RF are still over two-thirds of our total EBITDA. Next slide. So we look at the smaller segment, Energy Systems and Controls, we went into the year saying that about 60% of that segment would be in oil and gas, and that's actually going to be slightly less than that, just due to the sales, but notwithstanding that, we had a lot of FX exposure in energy with a lot of non-U.S. activity, so FX was a negative 5% headwind in the quarter. The oil and gas markets, were about as weak as we expected, in fact, when you look back about how they performed versus how we model them, there was literally no variance. The other served markets were flat with a few modest exceptions that were up. We had really terrific margin performance, as every body executed very nimbly, terrific deleverage performance and the operating margin is actually up 60 basis points from a year ago, and I think notably, its up 330 basis points from what we reported in the second quarter. So we have gone from 26% OP margin to 29.3% sequentially, on effectively the same revenue. So that's quite an accomplishment, and I think those -- everybody in this segment, for the most part, deserves a lot of credit for that. When we look at it, it's trending into Q4, what we would see is sort of the same level of weakness, but some incremental improvement, just because of some seasonal programs that tend to occur inside Energy. But with Energy being less than one in every $7 of revenue, it won't have a big effect for us. We had strong growth in our nuclear test business on improving market conditions. There is a good deal of activity that's emerging, both in China and Korea based opportunity in the Middle East, and startups again in Japan for their nuclear activity. So that's going to be a material improvement for us in the fourth quarter, and into 2016. The cost actions that we took earlier this year, you can see, have already improved our margins here in the third quarter, and we expect the margins to improve still a bit more into the fourth quarter of this year. Next slide; the industrial technology segment, which is about 10% oil and gas by the way, a little less in this quarter, it had a 4% hit on FX. We also have, in the industrial technology segment, the City of Toronto roll off from Neptune, which we said this year, would be in the neighborhood of $40 million or about $8 million to $9 million a quarter, and that's about what it was in this quarter. So that's most of the organic issue. Neptune, on the other hand grew mid-single digits, excluding the completion of the Toronto, so we were pleased with that. Our oil and gas markets were almost exactly as we expected them in here, but the margins remain really strong, when you think about the challenges that those folks had. They could have done a little better job on deleveraging, and we have talked to them about that, and I think we will see better performance in that respect in the fourth quarter. We continue to have growth in our Material Analysis businesses and they are holding up very well, given their European and Asian exposure. In the fourth quarter, we have already announced, as of October 2nd, that we completed the divestiture of Abel Pumps; that was a business that we sold for €95 million. It has very strong fourth quarter, so the buyer would be benefited by that, we had it projected in our guidance at about $14 million in revenue and about $0.03 a share of earnings, which of course, now goes away. On the other hand, we get €95 million and have already effectively reinvested that money in the acquisitions we have just made in higher margin businesses that don't require the assets that Abel was going to require to sustain its growth. Oil and gas is still weak, but growth in the other markets is pretty good and is offsetting for the most part, the oil and gas weakness. We do think in the fourth quarter, we will have better margins, with better leverage performance. Next slide; we look here at RF Technology. We were up, as you can see, 6% of revenue and up 10% in operating profit. If you look at that operating margin at 30.3% up 120 basis points, I want to remind us that the EBITDA margin in this segment is 35.7. So we have a lot of non-cash amortization and the 35.7 number demonstrates just how powerful the cash earnings profile of the RF Technology segment is. Organic revenue was up 4, FX was a 1% headwind, the growth continued in our Infinity Lane Systems, both in Florida and Texas and we have a number of quotations out, so that looks very favorable, as we go into next year. We had quite reasonable subscriber editions in our various Freight Matching businesses that supported growth in the quarter, and then we acquired RF IDeas in September, and that business has historically grown at double digits, and we certainly expect that that will be the case in the future; both Rick and Craig who are driving that business, have been there a long time. They have created an unbelievable value-added reseller network and terrific direct connectivity with OEMs. Primarily, the business provides proprietary card reading technology, so we can think of it -- doing for the individual, what Neptune reader technology does for a big collective entity. Lots of identification and authenticity ID that they have -- a lot of it is for single sign-on things like printers. There are literally hundreds and hundreds of applications and thousands of customers, its quite a decent balance sheet, as you might imagine, as our deals are. If we look to the fourth quarter, the software business, as we think will continue to grow at mid-single digits. We will get great leverage out of them and terrific cash flow performance. The backlog and proposal activity that we have at tolling traffic is pretty good. We don't see any slowing in that arena, and we will finally get done with a couple of projects, which have been -- things that have been challenging, to say the least, that it will be behind us, and that's really good news. And then, we will have very strong segment margin performance, we think, continuing, led by our SaaS and application software businesses. Last Wednesday, we completed the acquisition of Aderant. Aderant is really an incredible company, if we turn the slide here, we can look at a detailed exploration of Aderant. In a sense, its just a great business. It has lots of complementary notes that have come to us from various admirers of Aderant and Chris Giglio's team is -- I think we have never had as many unsolicited inbound notes about what a great business this is, and thank goodness its finally in the home of a public company, that will continue to invest and there has been an amount of fear, maybe unwarranted, but nonetheless, very real for law firms, who I am sure, wouldn't shock you that they tend to be somewhat conservative, who were not too happy to see Aderant in the hands of private equity previously, and it always makes people worry about, whether they can depend on continued internal development and growth. Aderant has a really end-to-end platform of mission critical software, that primarily goes to law firms now, but could be expanded to other professional services organizations. It has 3,000 of the world's largest law firms and professional services organizations, and they really do a full suite of activity, all the way from time capturing and billing to docketing. They are in Atlanta, they have got a great software business also in Auckland, New Zealand, which we were very encouraged by. We think they are going to generate over $125 million in revenue in 2016 and beyond, and of course, it is as always, a high margin business. If you look at our acquisition criteria on the right, you will see it has got an excellent management team. In fact, we are retaining everyone. So that's a checked box [ph] high recurring revenue yet, you can check that box, over 95% customer retention. Strong cash flow characteristics, asset life, well once again, negative working capital, so people pay us in advance for work that we are going to eventually perform. Very deep domain experience inside -- in terms of people who are accustomed and used to working with law firms and what their needs really are, and it has multiple growth opportunities, including opportunities to do additional acquisitions at Aderant, which is one of the things that we have been so encouraged by these last three larger transactions in the form of Sunquest, which you see us doing continual bolt-ons to and MHA, which we continue to do, and now Aderant, which is the third largest acquisition that we have made, will have a very strong forward opportunity to continue to add businesses to this very good platform. So another great niche software business for us. Next slide; if you look at Medical Solutions, and we haven't really dropped the reference to scientific imaging. I mean, the reality is, that its no longer very material; and in the quarter, the scientific image business had about a 6% decline, all of which really was our rugged mobile business, which we have been just gradually winding down. As you recall, we sold the Black Diamond business. That was reported in RF, it had a both DAP and JLT, and these things should be pretty well cycled through before the end of the year. If it weren't for that, scientific imaging would have been flat in the quarter. You can see that the medical businesses grew organically by about 5%, while total revenue was up 12%, because of the acquisition content. FX in the segment was 3% headwind. We had continued growth at MHA, with significant customer acquisitions, and Mike Sicilian and his team were able to acquire Atlantic Healthcare Partners, which is really a vaccine GPO, but it gives us a new channel direct to physician offices. It will contribute meaningfully to our EBITDA in 2016, and it is a terrific acquisition and so congratulations to Mike and Jason Connelly and others there. Our recurring revenue increased at Sunquest, which was a good sign. We really do believe, Sunquest is going to be positioned for a strong 2016, and everything that we have seen, as we continue to do these acquisitions, we will talk about the second, suggests we are putting together quite impressive platform of opportunities over a long period of time at Sunquest. Our medical devices business were quite stronger than by new product introductions and the execution around introducing those, at both Verathon and Northern Digital, those certainly outperforming the rest of our medical product businesses. Our recent acquisitions that we have done this year, all of which are performing above our internal plans for how they would do.  We signed an agreement just sort of virtually within the last couple of days to acquire CliniSys Group U.K., it’s a leading provider of hospital laboratory software, and so just think about it basically as being the Sunquest of Europe. It has sort of an elongated customary merger control review process that will happen in the U.K. and Europe. We expect that we should be able to get that all closed out, and it ought to be inside our reporting entity by the -- maybe the end of January, or certainly early in 2016. We invested £170 million in that business, but all CliniSys will be paid for from our non-U.S. cash. In the fourth quarter, we think we will continue to have kind of like mid-single digit organic growth in the medical businesses. But we think those margins will continue, as incredible as they are today; and once again, you will look at the op margin, where we reported 36.6, but remember, that the EBITDA margin is 45%. So lots of non-cash detractors on the op margin can confuse people about how great and powerful these businesses are on a cash earnings basis. We continue to have outstanding margin and cash flow performance in the fourth quarter. Our Atlas Medical acquisition, which literally we finished yesterday, will also expand our laboratory connectivity. This is really an amazing business that has been developed by founder Rob Atlas, who is extremely well known in the hospital arena, and Rob will be joining the Sunquest team. Atlas Medical, whose business will really be a bolt-on for Sunquest, but it provides a support mechanism to both Sunquest and Data Innovations. Connectivity Solutions are basically thinking about the lab to the physician outreach that a hospital would have, and then within the hospital, the concept of lab-to-lab communication, where oftentimes, people can't see the data they want, it results in unnecessary additional tests. We like the whole concept of coordinated diagnostics inside the hospital. We really believe that this gives us a pretty eminent edge over what other people do in this category, and over time, you will hear us talk more and more about Sunquest and Atlas as a combination. Next slide; here we will look at the guidance for the year. Next slide; we updated our guidance -- actually raised the guidance for the full year, to $6.69 to $6.75. Previously, it was $6.61 to $6.75, so this moves the midpoint up from $6.68 to $6.72, so it’s a $0.04 a share increase. But remember, this is despite Abel leaving and Abel will cost us $0.03, maybe $0.04 during that. So if we had not sold Abel, we would have raised the high end a little more, but we have to absorb that offset. And again, when you look at the cash conversion, this third quarter, it was 137% cash conversion for the year, certainly shouldn't exceed 130%, so the DEPS number is one thing, but the cash performance is quite much more important. We also raised our operating cash flow target to between $9.25 to $9.40 for the full year, and that's another projected increase from what we have suggested in the past, and CapEx is not running very high this year, less than $40 million, so its going to promote a lot of free cash flow. Next slide; so we go to the summary here for the third quarter, really a record quarter, despite the headwind. So not sure, we could have expected to do as well as we did, but we are quite pleased with the performance. Book-to-bill at 1.01 is a good sign for the fourth quarter, and gross margins reaching 50.7. I went back to look at where we were in the third quarter in 2011, and we were at 53.7% gross margin, so we have added 700 basis points to our gross margins in the last four years here, in the third quarter. Our operating margin is 28.7%, and our EBITDA margin is 34.4; and if you go back to the third quarter of 2011, you will see EBITDA was about 28.6, and now its 34.4. Our DEPS, $1.61 exceeded our guidance. Free cash flow, 25% of our revenue and 137% conversion. Full year DEPS raised and cash flow guidance raised; we deployed $435 million in three terrific acquisitions, and then, just as we began this quarter, we acquired Aderant, our third largest transaction in our history, and yesterday, signed an agreement to acquire Atlas Medical. So we were able to confirm everything we thought that would happen in the fourth quarter, and really believe we are very well positioned to have a record 2016, but we won't provide guidance around that until we report earnings in January. So with that, John, I think we are ready for opening up to questions.
John Humphrey: So Wes, I think we are ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Shannon O'Callaghan at UBS.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Good morning guys.
Brian Jellison: Hey, good morning Shannon.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Hey Brian, as you further expand into software right, we are in medical, now we are adding legal, and you mentioned the ability to go into potentially other professional services. I mean, is there any eventual barrier where a certain industry has some level of domain expertise, where you guys couldn't acquire and succeed with the software business like this in that industry? Maybe just a little understanding of why can you succeed in legal or why could you take this to other areas and is there ultimately somewhere you couldn't go?
Brian Jellison: Well I think that, we are always funded by these niche transactions, right, so we don't want to go into some situation, where people are going to write software off of our software. We are really providing some kind of service to somebody, we happen to be using software to achieve the benefit of what it is. But you have to have domain experience. So our guys at the core are software people, they are domain experts who use software to create a solution for somebody, that's efficient and effective for them. So as long as we continue to see things that are in those spaces, we will be able to make the acquisitions. Couple of sessions ago, I said, when we did Sunquest and we did MHA, they were really-really as important for the future of Roper Technologies, as Neptune and Transcore back in 2003 and 2004 for Roper Industries. Sunquest and MHA gives us world class leadership organizations, that allow us to do bolt-on acquisitions and things that are complementary to them, and most of what we have done this year, has something to do with one or the other of those organizations. Aderant is similarly positioned to do that. It’s a great organization. You can go back and look at Chris Giglio, he did a YouTube video on the day of the acquisition, that was just brilliant and you can see how he is expressing the fact that now being owned by a public company, his customers could have confidence that they will get the continued investment for his program to continue to become the most important player in that area. So we are always kind of agnostic about what it is the business does. So we don't really have a boundary around the business, as long as it hits the excellent magic high recurring revenue, great cash flow, prefer to have few, if any, assets and domain experience, then we are pretty wide open on where we would deploy our capital. Now, we also have some internal things, we always want to be able to add value to the business in some meaningful way that we can understand, and we want to think that people working our government system will perform better than they were, when they weren't in it. And if we think, in our diligence process that, neither of those would happen, then we would abandon the deal.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. That helps. And then, on some of the pressure against the -- or the performances amidst the oil and gas pressure, you talked about the sequential margin improvement that you got in energy, but a little less happy with the margin performance in industrial tech in the quarter. Can you just talk about the differences in terms of -- maybe just basic blocking and tackling of costs out, or maybe just a little bit more on what drove that and what you expect to improve in the fourth quarter?
Brian Jellison: Well I think that, what we got out of deleveraging and energy was more traditional, in the sort of 30-35, 38% type of stuff that we saw in most of the businesses. We didn't think that upstream guys in oil and gas and industrial, which by the way, was less than 10% of our revenue. They delevered it more than 50%, which we though was unacceptable, and we have shared that with them [ph]. So they were moving pretty quickly, but they haven't been as used to that kind of change, because they have been driven really by the fracking opportunity, and there really wasn't any cyclical uptick -- it always has gone up, they have never really gone back for a long period of time, and they just didn't do quite as good a job as quickly, as the energy people did. But that problems are behind us.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Great, thanks guys.
Brian Jellison: You have the City of Toronto cycling through, so that's an $8 million or $9 million negative income thing, which isn't useful.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Right. Got it. All right. Thanks guys.
Operator: We will take the next question from Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
Brian Jellison: Good morning Deane.
Deane Dray: I'd like to stay on the oil side of the business for a moment, and you mentioned that in the energy segment, you were expecting to see some cost savings benefits flow through, as well as fourth quarter, seeing some seasonal benefits. I was hoping you could provide some color there?
Brian Jellison: Well usually, you get -- typically, our Petroleum Analyzer business will get and [indiscernible]. They get fourth quarter seasonal activity, that is oftentimes MRO that's left over. These things we have are really not capital sales, and so they have every year, even -- I think, now every year they have an increase in the fourth quarter. So that will just give us a little bit more revenue in Q4 than we enjoyed in Q3, and with that, get a little bit better margin. They have been very nimble in responding, I don't know John, if you want to add anything to that?
John Humphrey: Yeah I mean, what I would tell you is that we are expecting some sequential increase from Q3 to Q4. Not as much as what we have seen in the past, in terms of the dollar increase. If you look back at kind of how this segment has performed in 2012, and 2013, and 2014, well we tried to add a nice jump up there. We are expecting some, but not as much as in the past, just because of the other headwinds that are present in new oil and gas markets.
Deane Dray: And how about the cost savings benefits?
John Humphrey: The cost savings benefit will continue to just manifest itself most of the costs out would happen in the first half. And so that, that flowthrough just continues in the fourth quarter against last year cost levels.
Brian Jellison: I do think, from a read-across [ph] basis, everybody believes there [indiscernible] of what they are seeing from a revenue viewpoint. We went through our quarterly review process and people certainly didn't have any optimism for the fourth quarter, but they all though things should pretty well bottomed out, and they were feeling better about Q4 than they did in Q3, and we don't yet have their forecast for 2016, but in the verbal discussions, people feel a little bit better. So the good news for us, is its getting to be such a small portion of the enterprise, that it doesn't have much effect, as you can see here. Because upstream is probably down 35% this year, and even with that kind of drag, we had record revenue and record cash and earnings performance in the quarter.
Deane Dray: Thanks. And just to follow-up on Aderant, did you disclose what the growth has been for Aderant and the renewal rates?
Brian Jellison: The renewal -- we said retention was about 95%. I don't think we have said a lot about growth. But its going through a little bit of a growth spur, as its gaining share against its primary competitor, who has got some issues. They will have to deal with terms of the software that supports their system historically.
John Humphrey: And also remember that this is another business that has a substantial install base, so you get a lot of maintenance revenue, right. So this is not a SaaS business. They have a small SaaS offering, which we think has very interesting prospects. But the majority of this business is a traditional license and maintenance model, and so when you talk about what's the growth rate -- the underlying growth rate of the ongoing maintenance, which is kind of in the low single digit range, but then you have the upside opportunity, as well as what they are capturing today, which is new share and new applications, which is growing much faster than that. So you blend it all together and it has a similar to Sunquest, kind of in the mid to high single digit, is what we expect of this business going forward.
Deane Dray: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Scott Davis at Barclays.
Scott Davis: Hi. Good morning guys.
Brian Jellison: Good morning Scott.
Scott Davis: I have been following your stock for a long time. I don't think I remember a time period where you have had such a flurry of deals and pretty attractive stuff on the surface at least. But talk to us a little bit about what would you attribute that to? I mean, sometimes maybe these things work out in the timing. But is there an acceleration on part of sponsors to try to pare some assets off their books at this time, and you're benefiting from that?
Brian Jellison: I think that might be the case more so in the next 18 months than it has been in the last 18 months. There has been a lot of stuff for sale, but there is always a lot of stuff in the pipeline. But I do think you are starting to see the signs of people getting worried about -- to get any kind of uptick on the risk premium around CCC credits and financing. People are going to start to worry about their exit multiples versus what their entrance multiples order. So I think everybody is wondering about what their exit time ought to be, if it should be moved up. But boy, the guys that we work with and talk to all the time, I mean, they are still deploying capital like crazy. So you see them making big bets and the launch of [indiscernible] very high trailing multiples at least, for what they hope will be able to grow into. So I don't think that there was anything particularly unusual, I think that we have owned Sunquest long enough, that we have a real purposeful strategy about what we are building out there, that's just starting to be able to be seen. We are still going to tell everybody exactly what we are doing. But when you look back and you see what we have done with data acquisitions and with strategic healthcare partners for MHA and Atlantic Healthcare. For MHa, and what we are doing here with CliniSys and what we are doing with Atlas, a couple of years from now I think people will -- we won't ever get another question about what ring counts look like.
Scott Davis: Understood. And just to follow-up -- and I understand that's business as well. But you talked about CliniSys being kind of the Sunquest of Europe. I mean, is the product offering comparable enough that you could consider merging these two entities or having commonality in management or any kind of synergies that would be not traditional or less traditional for Roper?
Brian Jellison: Well the problem of course is the U.K. health system, right. So Germany is different, U.K. is different. So there are regionally specific regulated industries that require different kinds of performance criteria versus what Sunquest faces in the U.S. There certainly will be synergies in the sense of improving our software development capability for those entities, and that's good. I can see, John's anxious to add too.
John Humphrey: Yeah I don't think there is any -- in fact, I know there is no plan to merge those things. What we do see is the opportunity for these businesses to work together, to bring new solutions to the market. There are kind of similar unmet needs and opportunities to do things, whether its around blood bank or other solutions. So there may be opportunities for the two businesses to work together in the future. But as far as the core offering, its very-very niche and kind of purpose built, and we don't expect those things to have any overlap.
Scott Davis: Fair enough. Thanks good luck guys. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Joe Ritchie at Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning guys.
Brian Jellison: Good morning Joe.
Joe Ritchie: So, you guys operated really well this quarter, despite organic growth turning negative, and I guess I am just trying to parse out some of the comments for 4Q and beyond. Do you guys see the third quarter as a trough in your organic growth? And as you kind of think about 2016, clearly, there are some headwinds this year, with energy, the Toronto Project, tough software comps and Sunquest. I am just trying to get a sense for just general comments across your portfolio on your organic growth in 2016?
Brian Jellison: Well I think 2016 is going to be a lot easier for us, because the headwinds that we faced this year should all subside. So I don't think that oil and gas would be worse in 2016 in a material way than it has been in 2015. Its likely to be stable or perhaps up a little bit on some of the areas. I think our fourth quarter will be kind of similar to the third quarter, but 2016 is a different story. So we are going to enjoy some of the acquisitions that we have made, will become organic in 2016 and that always helps. So just about everything is favorable. In 2016, you get rid of the City of Toronto drag, which, to bear, we get rid of the Rugged Mobile kind of winding, that has been down. We do get rid of a lot of drags. And so organic, these will be more favorable next year.
Joe Ritchie: Okay. That's helpful Brian. And maybe on my follow-up, it seems like this year you have been a little bit more apt to take a look at your portfolio, little bit closer with the divestitures of both Black Diamond and Abel. I am just curious, whether you guys are -- as you think over the next couple of years, will there be continued portfolio pruning as you continue to become more of a software type entity?
Brian Jellison: Well, we still love our cash generation businesses out there. They don't have any amortization. I don't know, maybe one of these days, we are going to report it on our cash earnings. It would be a different story. But man, the EPS we get out of our historical business is pretty spectacular, 33% EBITDA and fluid handling. Its hard to bind something with 33% EBITDA, right. So these businesses are really great. We think they are valued pretty highly inside our overall portfolio. I think people approach us -- I mean, our phone rang off the hook, when people saw -- we sold Abel, everybody in the world is calling us up about, hey can we buy your pump businesses, can we buy your energy business, can we do this, can we do that? And the answer is no. I mean, what are you talking about, you guys traded at a multiple that's lower than the imputed value on our business. And if we are going to do it, then we are going to do it for shareholders, so that shareholders get a premium to what they would be. So I do think there are creative things that people kind approach us on, and I was willing to listen to various things, but we like the businesses that we own today, for the most part.
Joe Ritchie: Thanks Brian. Helpful color.
Operator: We will take the next question from Christopher Glynn at Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning. I will resist the temptation to cease this leading [ph] opportunity to ask about rate comps [ph]. Speaking with energy, you did have a really dramatic sequential improvement on flat revenues with margin there, so just wonder if there are any trade-offs with that kind of material, really bring up some margin upside? And then how to think about, what that says about the leverage or the margin performance, as those markets actually return?
Brian Jellison: All good news. As they -- let us know when they are going to return by the way, we are not aware of that yet, Chris. But if they do come back, we will be printing money there. There is no question about that. We are already printing money in a hideous market. So yeah, that's all good news. But there is a little bit of a loss [indiscernible] numbers. The difference I think, if you look at the op and energy in the second quarter, and the op and the energy in the third quarter, we are up about $4 million in operating profit quarter-over-quarter on the same revenue. So you get sort of a nice kick there.
John Humphrey: And also Chris -- so structural. So the structural piece of these businesses, is the fact that they have a highly variable cost structure. So we don't have a lot of fixed costs that are hard and expensive and time consuming to take out, and then also, hard and expensive and time consuming to put back in. So these are primarily people related expenses, and so I don't expect that to be structural from that standpoint. Its flexible, and that's the important thing for those businesses, and to make sure that they are able to flex very quickly with volume decreases, but also be able to capture opportunities when volume comes back.
Christopher Glynn: Makes sense. Great. Thanks.
Operator: We will get next to Jeffrey Sprague at Vertical Research Partners.
Jeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning gentlemen.
Brian Jellison: Hey, good morning Jeff.
Jeffrey Sprague: I just wanted to circle back to kind of the deal activity again. A lot of moving pieces there. First, just to help us get our head around everything? Can you just kind of square us up? I am sure you don't want to go through every deal individually, but collectively, the $1.7 billion you're spending here in 2015, kind of what the combined EBITDA multiple might be or the run rate revenues from this basket of deals?
Brian Jellison: Well, we get some tax benefits in there, but on balance, I'd say, our purchase price for these things has been around 11 times, first year EBITDA. So you can kind of use that as a guidepost into what we would expect for next year.
Jeffrey Sprague: Net of revenue?
John Humphrey: In terms of revenue, for our first 12 months of ownership for all of that, right? So the first 12 months for Strata and SoftWriters and Data Innovations is largely in our numbers this year. But when we add all of that up, we get to something in the $375 million range.
Jeffrey Sprague: Right. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just a -- actually just a quick modeling question, John, has the tax rate got a downward bias here, is that part of the guidance construct in the Q4?
John Humphrey: Not really. Probably 31% or something like that into the fourth quarter, right? 31.5. But its hard to feel you have a downward bias, when you pay our tax rates. We are not in aversion, we just don't have any kind of things that are going on around the world. So our tax rate, pretty much for the year, if you look back historically, its going to be around 29% to 30% most of the time.
Jeffrey Sprague: Right. And then just one other one, Brian, I totally get your point on the industrial businesses, right, they get a Roper multiple instead of some other multiple, which makes it difficult to exit and you got a lot of cash you can deploy. But can you just give us a little bit of additional color on why Abel and why that might be different from the others and how you will be looking at this thing; because I am sure, you do have an open mind around value over time. What's just kind of the overall thought process there?
Brian Jellison: So Abel is really unique. In terms of the pumping technology it uses, it is unrelated to what we do at Cornell and its unrelated to what we do at Roper, which are our other two pump businesses. So it really offers us no surges of any kind, from a technological development viewpoint. The PP&E that's used to generate an Abel pump, these are really large. They are more like Flowserve or Dresser-Rand or something like that, or just totally -- typically in large test facilities, mostly witness tests. A lot of their growth, which should be quite good, will be in India, related to power generation. So the end markets that they serve, we are going to require additional capital deployment for us, to continue to grow those businesses. And it wasn't the place we felt like we should invest, therefore, we really felt that that would be better, if we cut this loose to somebody who is seeing it as a growth platform, which it can become. I think it’s a good acquisition for the people that bought it, and I think it will perform quite well for them. But we are able to get out if it at €95 million and, would be hard pressed to say, sort of 12 times trailing number was something we should turn down.
Jeffrey Sprague: All right. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Richard Eastman at Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman: Yes. Good morning, Brian, John, Rob.
Brian Jellison: Hey, good morning.
Richard Eastman: Brian, a quick question. TransCore has had some really nice wins, recently in Massachusetts, Central Florida. There has also been some commentary about Saudi Arabia and the Riyadh, maybe dialing down the metro spend in Riyadh. And I am just curious, when you sit through all that and put the wins there, with potential -- a little bit of softness in Riyadh, how does that business look over the next 12 months? Is the backlog support -- comfortably support a mid-single digit growth rate for TransCore?
Brian Jellison: Yeah. I think so. I mean, its cyclical up and down in terms of projects, its not sort of cyclical with the economy, but we are certainly not seeing any slowness. In Riyadh, they are expanding the project. Somebody said to me I think this morning, oh my goodness, Saudi Arabia, they need to borrow money, they want a bit of cash, they can't do any of that. I mean, wow, people do react on a lot of various things. I do not think Saudi Arabia is going out of business in the next month and a half, and I don't think Riyadh is either. So this is a multiyear contract, and once you have the work deployed, people have to have the backroom operations, they can't do it on their own. So there is a lot of different things that happen. Now this is mostly a traffic translink project, with a lot of upfront opportunity that's more civil engineering, and as that gets behind us, then actually margins will improve.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then again, with the wins, it seems like most of that is incremental in new wins, so you have to feel pretty comfortable about the business then?
Brian Jellison: We have ample opportunities to go through with TransCore and the rest of our businesses to see what the next 12 months or the next three years looks like, and we will be able to share that totality of that picture at the fourth quarter, when we initiate guidance for 2016. So I mean, just taking out one piece, yeah, we feel very good about that. But wait for the whole picture.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then, can I also just ask you internally, with Atlantic and mHA and all the conversations going on around generic pricing on the drug side, what have been the internal discussions there on the price component at those two GPOs? It sounds like you had some new customer wins here, which is really a positive, but any internal discussions around this generic pricing issue, and the impact, positive or negative it could have on those two businesses?
Brian Jellison: I mean so far, it has been modestly positive. But I would say that we are not in those conversations. We don't set prices, we help our members negotiate the best pricing and the best supply chain solutions that they can obtain. So it has been modestly helpful, but not by any stretch, is it the largest piece of the MHA growth that we have experienced.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Nice work and congrats on the quarter.
Brian Jellison: Thank you.
Operator: We will take the next question from Joe Giordano at Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
Brian Jellison: Good morning.
Joe Giordano: I had a question on CliniSys and maybe if you can help frame that market generally. You have your positioning in Sunquest kind of niche in the United States and then CliniSys you said is the Sunquest of Europe type property. Maybe, some color on how many -- if we look globally, what does this market look like, how many major players of that kind of size really are there?
Brian Jellison: Here is a situation, we just signed the agreement. When we are filing-- a lot of material like, either we do here with HSR, so that's all going into customary merger control reviews. So we have agreed with the seller, that we are not going to provide any information until after the deal closes. So I can't tell you a lot about that. But the end markets are quite similar to what happens here in the United States, the hospitals. While people think that there is universal healthcare in the U.K., there is actually a wide variety of potential providers that side that system, and CliniSys allows these people to have a uniform operated platform around all the things that go on, lapse. And we will be able to make them be more efficient for the healthcare system, because they will now get access to our Data Innovations technology and they will get access to some of the ways we do things at Sunquest. So we think from an end user viewpoint, the owner who has built this very good business in the U.K. and recently acquired business similar to it -- and Germany will benefit from providing additional services and clarity to the people that use hoar [ph] system to try it in laboratories. So we are bullish about that, but that's about as far as I can go, Joe.
Joe Giordano: Fair enough. You mentioned a slight strength in the materials analysis and industrial tech, and I am just trying to get a sense of how much is that market dynamic or how much is that unique to your businesses there? Maybe we can touch on that for a second?
John Humphrey: Its probably about 50-50. As you see global industrial production, whether that's around steel or automobile, so that is -- Joe we have got a little bit of positive tailwind. But you also have a lot of new and upgraded products and the expansion of Struers' global reach, and so it puts them in a very good position to continue to take some share. And we also have a very good line of other things, not just on the material analysis, their traditional area, but also some new things around hardness testing and some things they are introducing there, that has helped them. So it’s a little bit of both, little bit of market, little bit of self-help.
Joe Giordano: Great. And then just lastly, one quick housekeeping one; are you guys having any impact of Aderant in the fourth quarter guidance that you put up?
John Humphrey: Sure.
Joe Giordano: Like on an adjusted level, you have adjusted accretion in there?
John Humphrey: Yes. I mean, it will help us out by a couple of pennies.
Joe Giordano: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.
John Humphrey: You're welcome.
Operator: That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Okay. Well thank you all for joining us this morning, and we look forward to talking to you again in late January.
Operator: And that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q2  (2015-07-27 08:30:00) =====
Executives: John Humphrey - CFO Brian Jellison - Chairman, President and CEO
Analysts: Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity Scott Davis - Barclays Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the Roper Technologies' Second Quarter 2015 financial results conference call will now begin. I'll now turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Orlando, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss our second quarter results. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller, and Rob Crisci, Vice President of Planning and Investor Relations. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. Press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have slides to accompany today's call, which are available through webcast, and also available on our website at www.ropertech.com. Please turn to Slide 2. We'll begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we’ll be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. Now if you please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation in the appendix. For the second quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted, consists of purchase accounting adjustment to acquired deferred revenue and our recent software acquisitions including Data Innovations, SHP, SoftWriters, Foodlink and Strata for about $2.5 million. As a reminder, this represents revenue that absent our acquisitions, those businesses would have recognized. And now if you please turn the slide, I’ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: Thank you, John, We'll start off going through our second quarter enterprise financial results and then look at the detailed activity within the four segments and the outlook for the rest of 2015 and then questions and answers from the audience, so next slide. As you can see here a summary of the second quarter we achieved all time second quarter records for orders for revenue, for net earnings, for EBITDA both nominally and a percentage basis and cash flow and margins were really quite outstanding. Revenue was up 1% to $892 million. Organic was flat, but the FX headwinds were 3% in the quarter. We had 13% growth in medical and 4% in RF and we'll talk more about those two areas. Sort of mid single digit organic growth going forward and then additional benefits from acquisitions. We had declines in industrial of 9% and energy 12%. A lot of that is foreign exchanges you'll see, but our oil and gas arena was down a little over 20% in the second quarter, which was about on par little bit worse than we had expected and we don't really see any improvement in that for the balance of the year. It might get slightly worse. Gross margins, despite the end market headwinds were up 100 basis points and reached 60.1%. Our operating margins were up 60 basis points to hit 28.5%, which is truly outstanding margin improvement in this environment. Net earnings were up 10% to $173 million and that's represented $1.70 and of course we cover -- it is always about $40 million of non-cash amortization in there. Free cash flow was up 24% to $162 million. So these really are record results despite the foreign exchange headwind and the end market difficulty. Next slide; here we look at the quarter two income statement. You can see book-to-bill was 0.99 and without it being in each of the segments, it was sort of 101 to 0.98 or something. So orders were quite consistent with revenue. Revenue was as we said affected by 3% on FX little bit up 1% overall. Gross profit up 100 basis point, operating margin 60. You can see an effect to benefit had that we had planned throughout the year on a state tax matter, which has been resolved as we expected. We thought it might have occurred at a later point in time. It's impossible to know when it hit this quarter. So it lowered out tax rate from the 30.4% of last year to 25.7% this year and that certainly helped the net earnings being up by 10%. Next slide, here we look at the continuing compounding nature of how we grow cash flow. So in the second quarter, our operating cash flow as $173 million which was a 23% increase over last year's second quarter results. Our free cash flow was $162 million, a 24% increase over last year and for the first half of the year now, we've delivered $412 million in free cash flow, which represents a little over 23% of revenue and gives us a cash conversion ratio of 126%. And when you think about the compounding nature of us being able to reinvest our cash and transactions, it gives us still more cash. You can look at 2013 in the first half, we had $311 million and just in the two year period, we're up 39% and half one to $433 million. So we still think that cash measurement is far in a way the most important thing for people to look at when you're looking at the quality of the company's performance. Next slide, our asset-like business model continues to improve. Our working capital was a function of our second quarter annualized net sales at 4%. Two years ago, that number was 7.5% and people would consistently ask us how you could possibly keep it at 7.5% and we chose not to. We got it better, firstly cut it in half. So very nice reductions in inventory from 6.3% of revenue two years ago to 5.5% now and that's at a time when there were some considerable destocking in the oil and gas arena which certainly didn't help us sort of inventories. In receivables, they dropped from 19.7% to 16.6% and at the beginning of the quarter given difficulties, a lot of energy went into reinforcing our disciplined processes around receivables because as you know in periods like this you can have some sloppy activity around getting paid. And then if we take our inventory at 5.5% receivables at 16.6% and we subtract the payables of 18.1%, you can see our total net working capital there is 4%. Next slide, if we look at the overall financial position of the company, our cash increased from a year ago at $679 million versus $565 million. Our undrawn revolver and the cash together give us almost a $1.9 billion in powder. The reality is we can easily increase that because of our debt ratios. You can see our trailing 12 months EBITDA is now up to a $1.232 billion and while our gross debt to EBITDA is 2 or net debt EBITDA is only 1.5. We have deployed $1 billion in acquisitions in the last 12 months and we have a very active pipeline, now we did announce one acquisition we will talk about when we get to the RF Segment, but there are others that were far along and working on. Next slide, here we’ll discuss the individual nature of our segments. So the next slide, if we look at the four segments here you can see the second quarter revenue in the blue chart and the green chart being the second quarter EBITDA. And so now you have really RF and medical representing little over 70% of the total EBITDA that Roper is generating and they do that at very high EBITDA margins. Our energy EBITDA and industrial tech if you put the two together, the $100 million of EBITDA and $331 million in revenue, so even in a more difficult end market with FX pressures, we created EBITDA margins in the second quarter of 30%. The nice thing about the 70% EBITDA from RF and Medical is those businesses are continuing to grown mid single digits organically and they give us higher leverage on the next dollar of revenue than our energy and industrial businesses do. Next slide, we look specifically at energy systems. It was down 12% on revenue versus last year's second quarter but five points of that was due to foreign exchange and seven points on organic. Deleveraging here was very well managed. You see the operating profit margin in the quarter was 26%. Gross margins remained above 55% and we deleveraged at only about a 34% ratio. So once again, they've been able to take their variable cost structure, immediately adjust it. The oil and gas markets were weaker than we expected, particularly in those areas directly related to fracking, our debt business, the diesel engine shut-off valve business was down 50% and when we get to industrial you’ll see Roper Pump had some difficult things as well. The other markets, some of which were industrial that we report in energy all were satisfactory, generally flat a little bit of improvement in one place or another. The business executed terrifically well in the segment in the quarter they took some additional cost actions about a $1 million in restructuring, which is included in our results, we’re not excluding it. This demonstrates the benefit of having very few fixed assets. So we never have to work around absorption issues like others do and we get a very quick payback on variable costs take outs. We've cut about 150 employees in our oil and gas space between energy and a little bit in Roper and Cornell Pump. For the second half of the year we don’t really see any kind of forecast improvement in oil and gas markets. This is kind of a mixed bag. If you listen to various people, I guess if we were going to say, would it get better or worse, we’d be planning that they're getting worse and not better, but we expect them to be pretty much the way they were in the second quarter. We expect to get some modest growth in other served markets that these business have that are not in the oil and gas arena and we think that the FX headwinds are unfortunately going to continue to persists much as they did in the second quarter. We think we'll have high single digit organic decline for the rest of the year, but then gives us really easy comps for 2016. Next slide, if we look at industrial, industrial continues to perform incredibly on a margin basis. Their gross margins in the quarter were over 50%. Our operating margins were over 28%. They were down 9% on revenue, but 5% of that is foreign exchange and the rest of it is virtually a fact that our Toronto project and Canada with Neptune is winding down and they did very little in the second quarter. In fact, it was down $8 million in the second quarter versus last year. So the rest of the business actually performed fine. It would have been flat to modestly up. Our oil and gas markets again were weaker than expected. Roper Pumps saw some destocking activity in their surface pumps. So their revenue was down close to 80%, but the realign business was up twice as much as it had been the year before. So those products continue to be consumed in the ongoing activity of that technology that we've introduced. Rental markets were slow controllers as it relates to the upstream oil and gas was of course not good at all. Our Material Analysis business stores had just a very, very fine quarter. They were up more than double-digits organic growth. On a constant currency basis, it was up incredibly and still more than 10% even adjusted for currency. As our Neptune project sort of, it appears to us as virtually complete. We're only being asked to do odds and ins now. So that was a negative headwind of $8 million in the quarter. The rest of Neptune fortunately was continuing to grow and it looks to us like must be continuing to gain share. In the second half of the year, we don't really see any improvements as we've said around oil and gas markets. I don't think they get worse here. Likely they get a little bit of favorable increase. Roper accomplished a little slower than the rest of our businesses to react. So we've now cut about 40 people in flow control where the end markets have required that. So we think we'll get a little bit better deleverage performance out of them in the second half of the year than we got in the second quarter. Our Material Analysis business showed no signs of their weakening in any way. It's continuing to do really very well. Neptune in continuing to grow in the U.S. market. The Toronto project headwind in the second half for us is going to be about $20 million. It's about $30 million for the full year and that's the thing to happen. So these projects there aren’t those big ones that happen very often and they're working on a few, but the core U.S. business will have positive growth this year. So we think we'll have mid single digit organic decline for the segment. Next slide, carefully look at the RF business, you'll see we had revenue of $256 million, which represented organic growth of 6%. Actually the organic growth would have been little better. You can see in that topline, FX is down 1% and divestiture is 1%. You might remember in the first quarter we sold our Black Diamond rugged mobile business and that was a little over a $4 million drag on revenue in the second quarter for us. We had terrific results in our toll and traffic business and growth continues to expand. We got multiple projects for upgrades that are in quotation now. We probably really never had a better forward-looking opportunity than we do today with toll and traffic. The Riyadh traffic project started up in the second quarter and already has resulted in several change orders and extensions that we think will benefit us particularly in '16 and perhaps yet this year. We had double-digit growth in our tag sales for tolling. The software subscriber additions continue to grow nicely in our freight matching business. We have three of those. One in the East. One in the West and one in Canada. The strength in our RF product line businesses were excellent, particularly pendants for Senior Care, Submetering for apartment multifamily housing and the UK Water Application business along did well as a result as well. For the second half, we still have that little Black Diamond headwind in the second half. It will be several million dollars if it doesn’t repeat, but on the other hand didn't contribute any positive income. So it doesn’t have any effect on that. We've got backlog and proposal activity in toll and traffic as I said at all time high with lots of long term opportunities there. We don't see any pullback in our subscriber growth and our software businesses whether they're licensed for SaaS and we acquired On Center Software, which is in the Woodlands in Houston, Texas. Very nice business, well managed by Cecilia Padilla. It's really again a business that has higher EBITDA margins than Roper's base business. It's been growing at very solid double-digit revenue, but we actually think it's been underinvested and to support even faster growth and that business only just closed on Monday. So we're just getting started talking with them about how to enhance their growth profile. We think we'll get mid single digit organic growth for the segment at our end, but total revenue including acquisitions would be a little better. Next slide, here if we look at Medical Solutions, you can see once again you got a little story about us pruning businesses. We got rid, really exited our rugged mobile product line. That's in addition to the Black Diamond rugged mobile business, which was a little military app. This was a $5 million drag in the second quarter and that's another $7 million drag for the balance of the year. So right thing to do, this was the time to do it. It wasn’t contributing any income. The technology portion that we want, we've embedded inside our m-tech business. So that's really important for us. Organic revenue shows up at 2%, but if you adjust it for the rugged mobile discontinuance, organic revenue would have been higher. FX was a 3% headwind in the quarter for medical, but overall you can see revenue grew at 13% even with those issues and operating profit was up 18% and operating margin, that's not EBITDA, operating margin was 36.6%. We had very strong performance out of Managed Healthcare Associates. They continue to gain share. Of course they have very favorable market conditions as aging continues in the population, but just terrific results. Double-digit growth in our Medical Device Businesses, Verathon was very strong, Northern Digital very strong, and our CIVCO multi-mobility business was very strong. Sunquest, recurring revenue growth was as expected was quite good, but we did have lower license and service sales in the quarter because of the meaningful use pig through the python that occurred in 2014. So sort of a hopeless comp, but that will change pretty quickly as you'll see. Q1 acquisitions all three of them, the Strata business, the SoftWriters business and the Data Innovations performed very well and in fact the three together were above expectations and I mentioned that we exited the rugged mobile product line final. In the second half of the year you can see that we expect MHA to continue to benefit from the market conditions and their ability to execute against that and we see additional medical products out of Verathon as they launch several things in Europe that are new to the continent and Northern Digital expands in its sphere business. The Scientific Imaging businesses is basically flat. Sometimes they look worse than they are because they've had that rugged mobile business in it for quite a long time and for that long, that gives us a little bit of headway for variable performance in the future. We think we'll get mid single digit organic growth out of this segment, but of course much higher total revenue growth and then Sunquest has got a very nice opportunity that mostly benefits us in 2016, but a lot of software module upgrades now that meaningfully used processes subside with hospitals, the same people that were involved in those both at the hospital and at our level are able to look at enhanced growth as they do product upgrade, software upgrades for various applications within the hospital. Thanks a lot. Here we get to the guidance nature of what we think for the balance of the year, next slide. For the full year we were at or establishing guidance at $6.61 to $6.75 or midpoint of $6.68. Previously we were at $6.75 to $6.95 and the midpoint of $6.85 and we really decided to take that down because we thought we have organic growth of at least 3%, but it looks to us like it's more like 1% to 2% because of the depth of how much the oil and gas upstream markets really come down. We said at the beginning the Europe steam was about 5% of the business last year and about 14% for oil and gas in total. Now oil and gas is down to 12% as you might expect as the rest of the business is curling and the upstream portion will continue to decline as a function of total revenue. We’ll get mid single digit growth out of Medical and RF organically, but we'll get additional revenue because of the acquisitions that we already have and others that are possible going to occur. In oil and gas, we think that’s going to continue to be weak. We think it’s going to look much like the second quarter. So we don’t see much of a recovery in any of those end markets. Our tax rate for the year we said at the beginning there, we thought it would be about 30.5%. We still think it will be about 30.5%. The discrete item that we had in the second quarter around state sales tax was something we expected to have and it was in our guidance for the full year, but it did move forward in the second quarter. Full year operating cash flow we're saying should be $925 million. In addition to our net earnings we have about $160 million of non-cash amortization. Our Q3 earnings, which will be just purely the net earnings with debt numbers 153 to 157. Pressures for the year that we have to keep overcoming that we’ve done are largely led by foreign exchange and then quite a bit from oil and gas there that Toronto headwind and then some modest changes in imaging and industrial. Had a pretty strong June compared to April and May. So we’re a little bit encouraged in that respect. Next slide, here if we look at the second quarter summary, once again we have to really complement our operating people who acted very nimbly in terms of what was happening in the upstream oil and gas segment. Their ability to change variable costs is always just world-class and really terrific execution. In the meantime, we wound up with record quarters and revenue with net earnings and EBITDA for the quarter. And revenue certainly was hurt by the headwinds of FX, but notwithstanding that, we powered through in a very favorable way. Acquisitions were up 4% and offset the headwinds and Medical and RF were up so much, they offset the decline in industrial and energy, which was led by that oil and gas problem. Gross margins actually increased in the quarter, which was pretty amazing. If you're starting out at 59.1% and you can still improve gross margins in a quarter that’s organically flat that says a lot about the quality of the operating people we have in place. Our operating margins were up 28.5% and EBITDA margins at 33.9%. Net earnings we’ve covered before. Free cash flow up 24% in the quarter. The first acquisition that we've announced that would have been in the quarter didn't get done and 25 July, was on center and we’ve got an active pipeline and we would expect to close some additional transactions before the end of the year and in reflection we just see the quarter as being very pleased given the FX and selective end market difficulty in terms of how we performed. So with that, I think we're ready to open it up for questions John.
John Humphrey: So Orlando, we’ll start the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. We’ll now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping to get some additional color on the energy businesses broadly. In the first quarter you were thinking the whole market that you address would be down 35% and -- but your businesses might be down 20% or little bit more that obviously has worsened. So what are you assuming now for the balance of the year on the energy exposed? And then what are you thinking the market dose in those businesses as well.
Brian Jellison: So Deane, the way we characterize that, so we thought that the oil and gas market broadly I think we said maybe down 30%. It’s down at least that and probably a little bit more. It’s actually worse than what we expect. When you rig counts particularly down 50% year-over-year, that’s worse than we what expect it and so we saw that really impact those businesses that are in the oil and gas market that have any exposure to upstream. If we got something -- if I got something wrong, what I got wrong was there is a little bit of follow-on effect to some more of the downstream and midstream markets a pullback on capital spending on their exposure on the upstream side. And so what we're expecting as we go forward is really no improvement. Even though we've seen little hints of improvement in the oil and gas market, that's not what our guidance is based on. At this point, we're expecting it to remain flat to where it ended the quarter.
Deane Dray: And just to clarify, I know you've focused on the upstream exposure, you just mentioned mid and downstream, is that still the bulk of the exposure at 3% mid, 6% downstream and what's the expectations on those businesses?
John Humphrey: Yes, the exposure is as you described, so about 5% upstream and 9% mid and downstream and what we're expecting there is for that to be down kind of in the mid single digits.
Deane Dray: Got it. And just last one…
John Humphrey: While just to be able to clear, in the second quarter because it's already down, it's not 14% of our revenue, it's more or the upstream was about 4% of our revenue and then mid to downstream was a little less than 8%. So it's more like 12% on a go-forward basis.
Deane Dray: Got it. And just last one on the oil side, the expectation that Roper Pumps might be able to outperform on the ability to gain share, has that played out or is just the aftermarket on shell is…
Brian Jellison: It was down as spectacular. They more than doubled their revenue on realign products in the second quarter, which is what we were hoping. So that was a huge bonus, but what we got that we weren’t expecting, the degree of is surface pump, the revenue was down 79% and we had not expected people would shut that off entirely and they virtually -- orders were down 91%. So what that is even though it is not a lot of stocking, it just people weren’t going to use everything they had and end of life before they did other things. So the good news about the use of realign facility is they performed as expected, actually better than expected and it continues to gain share, but it's not big enough to offset the core flow control piece, it's down so much.
Deane Dray: Understood. Thank you.
Brian Jellison: Welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity.
John Quealy: Good morning. Thanks very much. First, for on-center, can you give us a little bit on the metrics multiple, it's SaaS versus perpetual license, a little bit there, thanks?
Brian Jellison: They have a lot of license and maintenance and they've introduced the SaaS model, so people are shifting over some to the SaaS model, but a lot of the things that they do have to do with bids and estimation and actual architectural moving of walls and things that's just phenomenal what their system is able to do. That's a business that's going to be a little less than $30 million of revenue with a little less than 50% EBITDA and it's positive leverage going forward. It's quite high and the growth rate is double-digit. So you can figure it out from there.
John Quealy: Perfect. Thanks. And then the future acquisition pipeline, can you talk about with oil being severely depressed, have multiples come in, thanks?
Brian Jellison: I wouldn't say that we've been following the multiples for acquisitions in the oil space for quite some time. It's been a decade since we've made any acquisition in that segment. I think Dynisco was the last one we made and it was in 2006. And despite whatever multiples might be doing in that space, that's really not where our focus has been. We continue to remain focused on higher technology areas, things that have exposure to in the markets that are cyclical like medical and other areas where we have a niche software or network type of business that we're looking at and that continues to be the types of things that we're looking for or some type of proprietary technology that benefits an existing area. That continues to be our focus area rather than trying to bottom feet in something like oil and gas.
Operator: And our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays.
Scott Davis: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Brian Jellison: Hi. Good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis: Brian, I am curious to hear kind of your view of the world, the last time we had your energy in industrial business is down this much, we were following into a pretty big recession, not far after that, do you look at this time as having risk profile or at least similar characteristics what you've seen in the past when the world was about ready to fall part or is this too isolated to just the commodity itself, oil?
Brian Jellison: No, no, no. We're debating -- we could have gotten more granular in our remarks, but just I think it's so instructive about how good our business model is, if you go back and you look at how the segments were in the second quarter of '09 and compared to the second quarter of '09 to the second quarter of '08 and then you looked at the comparison of the second quarter of '15 to the second quarter of '17 to see kind of the rates of change, you would be astonished at how much better all these are. The thing that is amazing in the second quarter of '09, our industrial tech business, which is largely Neptune and flow control, it had $32.5 million of operating profit on a reported basis and that was on a $136 million of revenue. So its margin, it was 23.8% in OP at a time when people were concerned the world was ending. This time this reduction, our OP and industrial is $52.2 million, not $32.5 and our revenue is $186 million, not $136 million. So we have now OP margins of 28% in industrial in the quarter versus 23.8% in the second quarter of '09 and it's nothing like the second quarter of '09 in terms of the rate of de-escalation. Second quarter of '09 over '08, our sales in the flow control segment were down 25.5%, OP was 31.7%. There wasn't a lot of currency issues either. This time our revenue is down 9%, not 25% and our OP was down 13%, not 32% and if you look at the energy segment, the energy segment in the second quarter of '09, it had $23 million or OP our $105 in revenue. So it had OP margins of 22%. This time it's got $37.7 million in OP on $145 million in revenue. So the margins are 26%, up 400 basis points from the second quarter of '09. The sales trend in '09 versus '08 was down 27%, this time it's 12% and half of that is FX and OP was down 35% this time it's down 15%. So entirely different and then it's always for us painful because people ask these reader cost questions about these two businesses, which represent less than 30% of our EBITDA. Roper, let's go to medical. Medical in the second quarter of '90 we had $12.4 million of OP on $76 million of revenue 16.3%. This quarter medical had $109 million in OP, eight times, nine times the number on $302 million in revenue and it wasn’t down, it was up 12% on sales and it was up 16% on OP. Our margin in medical was 36.1% versus last year's second quarter of 16.3%. Our challenge is simply to continue to grow these things as well as we can. In our RF segment in 2009, our second quarter had $39 million of OP on $187 million in revenue. So our margin profile was 21.1%. Today RF had $79.9 million double OP and it had $255.6 million in revenue. So sales were up 4%, they were really up more than organically and the OP was up dramatically. So you're looking at margins of 31.3% versus 21.1%. In total Roper, in the second quarter when people thought the business was ending had $96 million of OP on $505 million in revenue 19%. This quarter had $252 million in OP on $890 million in revenue $28.3 million. So we were up 930 basis points quarter-over-quarter in the as reported GAAP OP number. So yet there is a sharp reduction. Yes, we got rid of 150 people. Yes, the investment in that restructuring will turn cash positive in the fourth quarter and no, we're not really worried about it.
Scott Davis: Okay. I think that's clear. As a follow-up, can you give us a sense of -- you just mentioned about restructuring that was going to be my follow-up question, in terms of how much the quote “restructuring impacted the quarter” so we can get a sense of…
John Humphrey: About a $1 million pre tax.
Scott Davis: Okay. And going forward is that number -- do you feel like you've done what you need to do or is there more to be done.
Brian Jellison: Absolutely, I think we have done what we need to do. We'll see a little bit more that will come out in the third quarter just because of notifications and a lag and how that works. So there will be a few other people coming out in the third quarter, but all total, we think it’s going to be in neighborhood of about a 150 people out of 10,000. So it’s not very material.
Scott Davis: Fair enough. Okay, good luck guys. Thank you.
Operator: Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS has our next question.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Good mornings, guys.
Brian Jellison: Good mornings, Shannon.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Hey, on the industrial business, so ex Toronto it was flattish even with the surface pumps down 79%. Can you talk about a little bit more the other pieces there that grew in the quarter and what’s driving that?
Brian Jellison: Well the core thing was our Struers business in Denmark, which had nearly on a constant currency basis it grew nearly 20%, but it really was up sharply. We had researchers in the Germany. Struers does sell somewhat into the technology side of auto. So that’s pretty powerful for them at the moment. And they don’t really see any shortfall in any of that activity. I think Asia is more modest and Europe is up. Actually Europe in total for the company was surprisingly strong in the quarter. On a as reported basis, it’s a down a bit, but the currency was down 20%. So if you look at the costs of currency performance it’s pretty solid.
John Humphrey: And in fact Shannon, you're exactly correct, if you exclude the Toronto project, the industrial segment was about flat organic. And so that also speaks to the earlier question about oh, my gosh, is this broadly going to impact all these end markets? Well no, is the short answer to that and no because what we’re seeing is not anything like what we saw last time where the decline is really only focused on those businesses that have exposure to oil and gas end markets and the other end markets that we serve in these two segments still performed pretty well.
Shannon O'Callaghan: No that’s helpful thanks and then on medical in the second half, I know you had a kind of tough comp. This quarter it was only up 2%. You got mid single digits in the second half. Anything in particular, you mentioned a couple of things but anything in particular accelerating versus the 2Q rate?
John Humphrey: Acceleration is going to be around some new product introductions at Verathon and it just continued its share gains a little bit of the meaningful use upgrades. A few more of those happened in the second quarter for Sunquest and happened throughout the rest of the year. And so we actually expect the Sunquest be to get better in the second half than it was in the second quarter, but that was largely as expected for the way the year was going to roll out.
Shannon O'Callaghan: And the software module upgrade you are talking about there as more of a '16 thing, could that be a big number?
John Humphrey: Time will tell.
Brian Jellison: I don't think it will be -- rounded out when we get to the '16 guidance. So people in the hospitals just have to understand how much energy they have to devote for the meaningful use requirement for the government and for doing that we’re not doing a lot of other things and most of them have that challenge behind them And so this is our organization, so we don’t have to spend as much time in that phase, the implementation with them and we can turn our attention to demonstrating the immediate payback of upgrades to a wide variety of various things we offer.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Great. Thanks guys.
John Humphrey: You’re welcome.
Operator: We will now hear from Joe Ritchie with Goldman, Sachs.
Joe Ritchie: Thank you. Good morning, guys. So I recognize that energy is clearly a smaller piece of the puzzle today, but just want to focus on it for a second. I think last quarter you talked about some projects in compressor controls that you were looking at. I am just curious whether this project just got deferred or whether there is some cancellations and I am also interested in hearing anything that you can tell us about the inventory levels in the channel and what you’re seeing from a pricing standpoint?
Brian Jellison: We really don’t have any inventory levels in the channel. If you look at the energy systems business, the largest component of that is compressor controls and it's always build for a specific application for the firm oil that goes along with the software that we provide to people. It’s really a systems business. The little bit of products and they're really related to valves that we have, which are for these diesel engine shut offs and certainly that had just come to dramatic reduction of about 50%. So there is a little bit of inventory that they got to work off, but not a lot in pipeline because the fact we basically sells direct and a lot of these products and they have very fast turnaround. So there is not a lot of -- there really aren’t channel partners out here or stocking and reselling stuff. The only thing that we have that gets stocked are standard Neptune water heaters and that’s through our proprietary distribution network and certainly no inventory problems there. As far as CCC is concerned, it’s really around slowness in people deciding what they're going to do. So they haven’t lost any projects. We haven’t any projects that are canceled. There just things are relatively slow, as you would expect they would be for people to make big capital decisions right now.
Joe Ritchie: Okay. That’s helpful and Brain any color on pricing?
Brian Jellison: Well our gross margins were up a 100 basis points. Gross margins and energy are 57%. Our gross margins in industrial are 50%. So I wouldn't say we have a lot of pricing problems.
Joe Ritchie: Okay. And so what are your booking into backlog still appeared at least comparable to what you booked previously.
Brian Jellison: So probably you're looking at read-across stuff from others and that’s not what we do. We have very, very specific applications. Not a lot of competition, but Denmark it's all up. We catch a cold. And that's what's happened, but doesn’t affect our -- we're not in a competitive market place where we’re overly concerned about pricing. And in a market like this that’s end market driven, it doesn’t market what you’re pricing is. People aren’t going to buy more because the price is well run.
Joe Ritchie: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. I’ll get back in queue.
Operator: We’ll now hear from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa: Hey, good morning.
Brian Jellison: Good morning, Steve.
Steve Tusa: On the acquisition pipeline, any sense of a change at all? Is the market gets a bit more volatile or some financial issues perhaps globally maybe some of these guys pulling back a little bit from a private equity perspective. Any change on pricing broadly?
Brian Jellison: They have so much new money that keeps coming from investors that they're at least not worried about pricing with other people's money. I can assure that they're just as aggressive as they've ever been and you still have lots of forms. If we look at the large banks like the JPMorgan getting told let’s watch how much on putting on debt staples here. Let’s not get above five times and so forth. Quick then, there are all these other kind of people out here. Pension funds from unions in Canada, they got all kinds of people that are happy to supply all kinds of debt. So we still see 6.5 times debt on anything that’s really a good business. So that drives up multiple. So multiples are still high, but on-center the perfect example of the kind of things that we do, here you've got a very well run business and a very nice markets. It's pretty niche oriented thing. Doesn’t lend itself to and Oracle or SAP coming in and trying to take it over. It’s a business that Management wants to stay with and drive the business and they want to have a home that will invest in them. And we fit that better than private equity. So that all of these things work to our favor and then nothing like that has changed the acquisitions that we have right now are all similar to those kind of things. So we don’t see that as a constraint.
Steve Tusa: Got you. And then just one last question. I think this is little more just like top down I was trying to kind of learn about how you guys manage these businesses since your operating model is pretty unique and a little more decentralized. So when like am oil and gas issue or an issue like this pops up, it happened a couple of years ago as well when you had the nuclear business that fell off. Are those guys coming to you and saying late in the quarter obviously, hey, we're weaker than expected, here's our plan and you say okay, good, plan, go to it. Is there any wrangling. Is there any top down from you guys more of a discussion where you kind of push more aggressive actions down. I wouldn't think that's kind of the way that you guys manage because you have such great operating people, but I am just wondering how this kind of -- how this makes its way up the pipeline to you guys and then what you do if anything to kind of tweak that they're responding to end market like this, that's obviously highly unique and kind of a surprise?
Brian Jellison: That's a great question. We have an enormous benefit here in that each month, the second after the month ends, we know what their orders and their revenue were and we as you remember, we run this place on both economics and accounting because GAAP accounting gives you such distorted information about what's really happening with cash nature of the business. So we know what the breakeven of the business is. Going into a quarter means what the marginal contribution will be after they've covered that on a revenue basis. So we immediately, two days after a month ends have a very good idea about what's happening to their trend and we will talk to them at the end of that month. They’ll provide us a quadrant feedback about what's hot in the business, what's happening in terms of what they're winning or difficulty that they're having. How the quantitative nature of the business is in the month and what they're concerned about and so that becomes more of a socratic discussion, but we're going to encourage them to take the actions that they need to take, but never harm the business. So we always start out with do no harm and we've done it so much for so long, it's just a cultural kind of thing. Nobody would hide stuff here. It's not like your typical multi-industry company that many of our senior leaders grew up and we've all had really bad quarter to make sure you paint the plan. So that's not how it works here and people know that.
Steve Tusa: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And next we'll hear from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman: Yes. Good morning.
Brian Jellison: Good morning.
Richard Eastman: Brian, just a couple question around the RF Tech piece of the business, really two things. One is on the EBIT margin there, the 31.3%, is that again, is that very influenced by the non-tolling businesses just in general, is there a mix issue there that got the profitability that high? And then secondly on…
Brian Jellison: Currently the non-tolling business, we have software businesses in there. They're high margin and the tolling services side of activity has lower margin, but the technology product side with the readers that we deploy and that it has to go along with are much higher margins. So they come in with abundant margin that's quite good, but more like the rest of our businesses than the software businesses, which are higher. So as we have higher software, it's good, but right at the moment, you've got quite a large piece of our activity is in tolling. So it has a big effect and they certainly\ are much more profitable today than they used to be.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then is the -- the deadline for this interoperability is 2016 and is that aside from Riyadh in the tolling business, are we seeing that influence or have we seen it or should it accelerate when it comes to TransCore?
Brian Jellison: The benefit that TransCore has is we have the best technology. So we have readers that are capable of reading what are called multiple protocols. So we can read a wide variety of things. The people who are sitting in Chicago and the people on the East Coast are stuck with a proprietary very old technology there out of the Austrians. And you would have to ask them how they feel about their future, but we're heavily engaged all the time with people around interoperability and ways that we can facilitate them. The higher degree of interoperability when we have the best protocol technologies to read all the different things that are already embedded should be favorable to us.
John Humphrey: The other thing I would say on that Ric is we've also recently introduced, it's in the last year I believe, not only the multiple protocol reader that Brian talked about, but also a multi-protocol tact. So we're actually selling tags right now to real customers and that tag can be used all across the country no matter where the driver most of these are commercial applications right now where over-the-road vehicles, trucks etcetera. We want to be able to have that single tag that can go through all the pieces and we're at the leading forefront of the weekend of technology there.
Brian Jellison: We're fully faster than others, but also the change out coming from government sometimes is slower than they're suggesting.
Richard Eastman: Understood. Okay. And then secondly on the Medical Solutions Business, it looks like MHA had a fantastic quarter and so two questions there. One is can you just give us a sense of I presume that your market, your favorable market conditions comment as maybe perhaps around pricing, can you give us a sense of what the double-digit growth that MHA maybe how much of that was pricing pass through? And then secondly, CBS Healthcare is buying OmniCare and some of the OmniCare drugs I believe go through MHA, the specialty Pharma and I was just curious is that an opportunity that acquisition or is that a potential threat to MHA going forward?
Brian Jellison: We certainly don't see it as a threat. OmniCare is not out biggest customer, but just so people understand we get a percentage of things that happen in terms of the billions of dollars of stuff we're processing. The revenue that we get is just a percentage of that. So we don't raise prices in terms of that percentage that we're getting from somebody, but if generic drugs for instance go up in price versus where they were before, then we will get a benefit from that because the activity comes out at a higher price if you have formulary drugs that get converted to generic and the price goes down, that's a decrement for us. We have benefitted by generic Pharma pricing being higher in the last two years versus the way we modeled it at the time of the acquisition. So that has been a benefit and then you see today what is doing Teva's doing with $40 billion transaction. Generally, the things that are going on in the marketplace are favorable to us.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning. And I think you just kind of got to some of the questions I might have asked, but how are some of the RF growth strategies playing out and how should we think about the compounding opportunity as you're building out this installed base further?
Brian Jellison: Well in the software businesses, they have very high marginal contribution rate. So as they grow, you got more cash to reinvest in other acquisitions. They really don't need to consume more cash inside them. So that helps us. TransCore situation in RF because it's a big piece of the segment is slightly just better managed today than it used to be -- used to be on their service side of stuff, particularly almost civil engineering and the design of things at the beginning of roadway exits and what have you, they would have cost plus contracts, but they would have retention issues and I think today TransCore is about 10 times better as an operating company than it was when we acquired it. And so they don't -- they get pretty decent margins out of that, but big revenue growth out of them on the service side doesn’t have the same margin contribution that all the rest of our RF businesses do.
John Humphrey: And the other thing I would say there is that on the tolling traffic piece. It's not the same type of compounding that is on the software side, but because we execute so effectively, because the TransCore guys execute, they're able to win projects in adjacent areas. Our execution around our software for the New York City traffic control system was the reason why we won the Riyadh project in addition to our proven ability to execute in the region with our toll solution for Dubai. So those things don't always kind of have a liner relationship in terms of building on themselves, but the larger we become there, the more opportunities that we see.
Christopher Glynn: Yes definitely noting a big difference in that business. And then on -- you noted the challenges on working capital improvement in times of disruptive oil and gas markets and sloppy payments and such and very complimentary deployments employees there. What are the key enablers there? Is there a lot of customer selectivity historically or tough collections practices?
Brian Jellison: I would say that the primary thing is that the things that we provide, customers rely upon. And so we provide the discipline for our businesses so they have the ability to say no to people. That's one of the benefits that we're able to provide for folks. And because customers are reliant upon this specific technology or the solution that we're providing, it's not something that they can just say, look I am not going to hold payment. You guys can't ship to me anymore. That's too important to our customers. So it's good execution in terms of the discipline, but primarily it's because of the position that we have in the end of markets that we serve.
Christopher Glynn: Got it, thanks.
John Humphrey: I would say that the other thing having worked in very large environments, if you go into typical multi-industry and you ask somebody who is responsible for receivables, you will get a different answer than you will get here because if you go and you ask somebody running one of our niche businesses, which remember may only be $80 million in revenue, who's responsible for receivables, because he is going to say [ridge Betty] [ph], and she's been here this long, and she knows that and so there's a focus level here that is just very helpful.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks.
Brian Jellison: Okay. Thank you. And I think John, with that we're going to…
John Humphrey: Yes, I think we've reached the end of our -- the end of our time. So I want to thank everyone for your participation today and we look forward to talking to you again in three months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference for today. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2015 Q1  (2015-04-27 08:30:00) =====
Executives: John Humphrey - CFO Brian Jellison - Chairman, President and CEO
Analysts: Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets Shannon O' Callaghan - UBS Steve Tusa - J.P. Morgan Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to today’s Roper Technologies First Quarter 2015 financial results conference call. Just a reminder that today’s call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Laurie, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss our first quarter results. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller, and Rob Crisci, Vice President of Investor Relations. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. Our press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast, available -- the link for our website is available on our website www.ropertech.com. Please turn to slide 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we’ll be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of all that information. Now if you please turn to slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation in the appendix. For the first quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted consists of a purchase accounting adjustment to acquired deferred revenue and our recent software acquisitions. The total of this is about $1.9 million, which is an add back to both revenue and to operating profit. As a reminder, this represents revenue absent our acquisition those businesses would have recognized, this is solely as a result of our acquisition that requires us to have this revenue adjustment. And now if you please turn to the next slide, I’ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: Thanks John, good morning everybody, I think I have a slide that says Q1 enterprise results, so we'll turn past that and discuss Roper Technologies just for a minute. We're delighted to be bringing this morning’s call to you as Roper Technologies for the first time. We changed the name after the market closed on Friday. The ticker symbol is going to remain the same at ROP, the way The New York Stock Exchange works, our name changes takes perhaps two days for the trades to go in as Roper Technologies, but you're certainly available to buy the stock today. You can expect to begin trading on Wednesday we believe in the Roper Tech and John mentioned its ropertech.com now for the website, that's been changed over the weekend, I think the link to these slides are on it. If you're having any trouble with normal page [ph], you can go there. And the seasons for Roper Technologies is sort of obvious, I think for those of us that have been talking with you for the last several years, all you have to really do is look at our gross margins, which this quarter are 60% to recognize, this simply is not an industrial company. The quality of our businesses, the nature of the amount of money they reinvest to grow themselves and develop technology, the gross margins they have and their long-term growth rates reflect the idea that really is a technology company now and the opportunities that we have are far greater than they used to be a decade ago, when people where focused on product businesses as opposed to software and medical technologies and information networks that could become ubiquitous for niche applications. Next slide. If we look at the first quarter enterprise results, we were able to power through any of the difficulties with oil and gas upstream stuff that people were talking about including ourselves going into the quarter. So we achieved record orders, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow. Our organic revenue was up 5%, we had established guidance at around 3% to 5% throughout the year, Q1 being strong and Q3 being strong we think over the course of the year on the organic slide. Growth clearly was led by medical and radio frequency segments and I'll talk specifically about those shortly. Foreign exchange caused us 3% in the quarter on revenue. Our gross margins as I mentioned hit 60% which is a historical breakthrough for us, they were up 140 basis points. The operating margin was up 190 basis points, speaking again to leverage and efficiency, to 28.7%. When you think about amortization, the non-cash amortization we have, if you looked at our EBITA results that's how you can see, we do so well on cash, they were 33% in the quarter. Net earnings were up 7% to $157 million, DEPS $1.55. Much more importantly is the cash, we had the same number of shares that generate cash as generate net earnings and our free cash flow was $250 million, up 24% in the quarter compared to the $157 million that we report on a diluted EPS basis. We deployed $590 million on three great medical software companies. We’ll explain those three during course of the morning. So, we’re really positioned after Q1, which was probably going to -- we always thought it would have been the weakest quarter we had for a record 2015. Next slide. If we look at the income statement in Q1, you’ll see book-to-bill was 0.98. You may remember we’re always talking about 0.97 to 1.03 is kind of a span that’s meaning once it just, normal sea, because we have so many different issues around when projects did and what have you. So, we’re quite comfortable with that. Revenue, as we said, was up 5%, despite the 3% FX headwinds. As reported, it’s 4%, on an organic basis, it’s 5%. If we look at the gross profit, one of the points I make in addition to the 60% reflecting our technology platforms, it’s really amazing to grow a 140 basis points of gross margin in a quarter. If you were a 35% gross margin company, getting into 36%, people would be raving about it. But wholly [ph] it’s just amazing when you’re at 58.6% that you can get it to 60%. Operating income was up 11% to $249 million. We mentioned the margin up 190 basis points above the gross margin improvement. The earnings before tax were up 11%, but we had real tax headwinds in the first quarter compared to last year. You’ll see our tax rate was up 300 basis points and the headwind cost us $0.07 a share. Even with that, the DEPS still were $1.55 against $1.46 last year. Next slide. If you look at our cash flow, it continues to amaze as we compound the cash flow, because I suppose if you are using one word to describe the Company any more, it might be that they’re really a compounder. Our first quarter cash flow of $260 million is a 22% increase and we spent around $10 million in CapEx. So, our free cash flow, as we said, is up 24%. The conversion rate on our free cash flow is 161%. Now, that’s beyond spectacular. It represents almost 29% of free cash flow to sales, but in the first quarter, we don’t have US fed tax cash payment. So, it tends to be just a little bit overstated in the first quarter. You can see for that reason, we put the trailing 12 months free cash flow of $851 million, which is 24% of revenue and a conversion rate on a trailing 12 months basis of 130% in kind of keeping with our commitments that we expect it always to be above 120% over the course of the year. We still believe strongly that cash is the best measure of performance, not some of the things that other people look at. We don’t provide cash per share, but we sure think about how much the cash is year-over-year. Next slide. The asset-like business model, it’s really a critical important, because, well, lot of people talk about business systems. Basically, our governance process model is our business system and one of its core components is our focus on working capital. Here you can see, if we just look at the last couple of years, inventory has dropped from the end of the first quarter of 2013 at 6.8% to 5.7%. In this quarter, receivables have come in a little bit. Payables and accruals are about the same as they were. So, we find that our net working capital number for the end of Q1 is 5%. That’s a 270 basis point improvement in just two years’ time. And what I think is incredibly important is if you look at the long history of this continuous journey we’ve had on getting more asset-like having much higher velocity, I looked back at where we were in the first quarter ten years ago in 2005, and at that time, our inventory was around 10% versus 5.7% today and receivables were 18.4%. The payables and accruals were about 14% versus 18%. So, when you net those numbers ten years ago, we were above 14% in net working capital and here we are now at 5% and I can assure you that our governance process, it has a great deal to do with that focus.  Next slide. We look at financial position of the company. You can see that cash has gone up from a year-ago’s quarter from $500 million [ph] to $615 million. Our cash and undrawn revolver is still $1.7 billion. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA has gone up from $1.118 billion to $1.223 billion. And what is really clear is, in the last nine months, we have deployed $900 million in acquisitions and yet our gross debt ratio is exactly the same as it was a year ago at 2.1 and our net debt-to-EBITDA is about 1.6.  So our balance sheet still has large room for us to continue to make acquisitions over the next 12 months to 15 months and there are a lot of exciting things that we are involved with today. So we feel that both the balance sheet and pipeline are very strong. Next slide. Here we will get into the specific segment detail of each of the segments. So the next slide is our first quarter 2015 segment performance, where you can see how the four layout, they all have great gross margins and EBITDA margins. But the power of our RF and Medical Technology businesses becomes much, much clear to people when you look these slides. You will see for instance, Medical alone in the quarter generated $135 million of EBITDA. If you added both Energy at $36 million and Industrial at $63 million together, you get $99 million. So Medical was a 136% more EBITDA than those other two businesses combined. And if we look at RF and Medical, they represented 69% of the enterprise EBITDA compared to 30% for the Industrial and Energy businesses. Next slide. The first segment we’ll review today is the Energy System, because it’s – we will go with smallest to largest. As you can see in the pie chart, Energy business in Q1 represented 11% of Roper EBITDA. It had negative organic growth of 5% and FX cost of 5%.  The oil and gas markets were as weak as we expected. Upstream businesses, particularly in orders was down double-digits and we don’t see that really improving throughout the year, I think could probably deteriorate a little further. Large projects remain particularly slow, which affects our compressor controls business, and still has decent opportunity in front of it. But cost actions were taken in some of these businesses that are all nimble. They have a huge advantage because we just have this asset wide footprint everywhere, so we don’t have to do much around plans, but we have done a few things investing a little less than $1 million in restructuring charges within the quarter and that’s inside the numbers, not an excluded item. We had modest organic growth in the refinery application businesses. People seem to feel that’s going to continue to improve throughout the year. Our other served markets in Energy, which represents about 40% of the segment, couple of those businesses that were instrumentation oriented were up and a couple of the businesses that were sensor products were down.  For the second quarter through the fourth quarter of the year, we would think the oil and gas markets will remain challenging with 20% of this business upstream and 40% down to Midstream. We wouldn’t see that improving during the course of the year, but sequentially it will get better, just because Q1 is always our lowest quarter.  We think we will have flat to modest growth in the other served markets that we have that report through the Energy Systems segment. The FX headwind should drive mid-single digit segment decline for the balance of the year in our opinion, but we do think we will have a stronger sequential reporting numbers in the second quarter than we did in the first and I would point out that gross margins in Energy in the first quarter were still 55%. So this is not a business that’s under siege by any stretch. Next slide. Here if we look Industrial Technology, organic revenue was actually just modestly positive, one point of organic revenue. We had FX headwinds, which were a negative four points in here. The share gains at Roper Pump gave us double-digit growth despite the declines in the upstream market, which is exactly what we predicted when we established the guidance.  Neptune’s Toronto project is nearing a successful conclusion. It’s down year-over-year on a quarter basis and it will start to be down a little bit more than that in the second, third and fourth quarters compared to the prior year, so it’s a headwind basically for the company.  We had growth at our Cornell Pump business that was driven by new products and the niche applications that they are involved with. They may have a little bit of a tougher time with rental companies in the latter part of year, but it's still holding up well at the moment. Our Material Analysis businesses were down slightly, but we had terrific orders, in fact all-time record orders for our stores [ph] business in the first quarter which was a pleasant surprise.  If we look at that project completion for Toronto, we think it should be sometime in the summer. We think we will continue to have weakness in the upstream portion of fluid handling for Roper and Cornell. The Material Analysis business, we think, will continue to improve and given the FX headwinds, we would expect kind of mid-single-digit segment decline for the balance of the year after a little bit of positive and this represents about 20% of the EBITDA for the Enterprise.  Next slide, here is Ropers RF technology business. That business had organic revenue growth in the quarter of 11% and had a point of FX headwind and we actually sold our product line, which is called Black Diamond, that was a defense oriented rugged computer technology that really belonged in the hands of somebody that was clearly in that business. And we achieved a sale of that product line in the quarter which added a little downward pressure and it’s been removed from the base line.  We had very strong growth in toll and traffic, our technology which is trademarked Infinity Digital Lane Systems continues to be deployed rapidly in Florida and Texas and the bidding activity around our Infinity Lane Systems is very robust. We had very significant tag shipments that benefitted both the revenue and the operating margin. You can see the OP profit at $74 million was up 19% compared to the first quarter of a year ago. And we had quite significant subscriber additions to our SaaS based freight matching model which gave us double-digit growth and normally that is a business that grows toward a single digit. So that was very encouraging. For the second part of the year, Q2 through Q4, we think the backlog is going to support the toll and traffic growth. The Riyadh project begins in earnest in the second quarter and our tag shipments strength that we expect to continue with kind of known places for deployment. Our software and SaaS businesses we think will grow mid-single-digits, but they do give us very, very outstanding cash return. So modest growth there as always with a lot of cash. And we think we'll have kind of mid-single-digit organic growth for the segments for the balance of the year. And you can see RF represents 27% of our EBITDA here in the pie.  Next slide. If you look at Medical Solutions, Medical was up 15% in revenue and 22% in operating profit and OP margin was up 230 basis points to 37.3% and it’s lot of non-cash amortization in Medical. If I look at the EBITA margin, it’s 44.9%, so truly outstanding businesses. Organic revenue was up 7%, we get the 3 points in negative FX in there.  Our MHA business had double-digit growth that was really driven by market conditions and new customer additions that we’ve gotten as they continue to focus on building that platform. We had double-digit growth at our Verathon product business. We got a series of product introductions we talked about last year, all of which are doing well and we continue to build out their channel to get better coverage. Sunquest growth continued despite a difficult comparison. Last year, we had a considerable revenue as a result of implementing meaningful use program. So one thing is to sell the software, but implementation is different – a diverse revenue stream and that heightened last year’s numbers, so it will be difficult as a comp throughout this year, but the underlying recurring revenue continues to grow nicely. The Scientific Imaging businesses were pretty flat here. As you will notice, we are really calling out the segment as Medical Solutions, because the Scientific Imaging portion really is down pretty much microscopy applications. There is not a lot of stuff here to talk about anymore. We did deploy $590 million of investment in three great medical software acquisitions for the medical solutions business. I will explain those in a moment. For the balance of the year, we think MHA is going to continue to benefit from favorable market conditions, most of us appear to be getting older and there are a whole wide variety of people that provide services to and the execution that MHA has is really, really world-class. Sunquest, we think, is going to continue to perform well against those difficult comps I mentioned above and Sunquest has a great deal of initiatives around 2016 that are gaining momentum, certainly did in the first quarter and are continuing now. Some of those, we can't really talk a lot about because they’re proprietary, but they’re very exciting development opportunities for Sunquest.  The medical products growth we think would be led by Verathon and Northern Digital in the last three quarters as their pace picks up particularly there. We think we will get mid-teens revenue growth for the segment and the acquisitions that we made in the quarter are really going to help our future growth, because there are synergies in the marketplace as they coordinate more with Sunquest and MHA in the future. Next slide, if we look at these three healthcare IT acquisitions, these are all software companies, the first Strata Decision Technologies in Chicago has great leader, a wonderful team, they’re really providing subscription financial analytics and performance platforms for hospitals. These enterprise-wide things are really around the effectiveness and cost reduction opportunities for hospitals and decision support, so that they can kind of think of themselves a little bit more like the rest of us think about cost and continuous improvement and the technology is really spectacular. Now, they are already in one out of five US hospitals with one or more of their applications, but they are very early stage for the new applications that have been developed, which is part of the reason we -- they really needed to be acquired by somebody like us who can rapidly invest in the development of those. SoftWriters is a business that’s going to be co-ordinated with MHA, it's in the long-term care pharmacy space, it provides enterprise software for people who do that work, it has on-premise software delivery, models that get recurred billing, e-prescriptions or something that rapidly is growing and this facilitates that. They have the exact same customer base really as MHA, so the two together are going to create a better service footprint for customers. In Data Innovations, this is a business that will closely align with Sunquest. It’s the largest clinical and blood laboratory middleware provider and if you think about middleware, you might think about you having to download your printer driver to get your laptop or CPU to print properly well. Data Innovations for one of a better way to explain it is really the ability to connect to communicate between lab instruments and the tests that are deployed and then that information showing up where the hospital needs to have it. The Data Innovations has the largest library with over 1,000 laboratory devices, types of devices connected all over the world. They are deployed in 80 countries and you can just imagine the hundreds of thousands of tests and feedback that are required to the clinical use of the data that they are interacting with. This adds a lot to our Sunquest capabilities in the hospital laboratory markets and both companies should be better as a result of the synergies that we get out of this transaction. Next slide would be to update our guidance. When we look at the next slide, if you look at the second quarter and the full year guidance, we’re raising the guidance from $6.70 to $6.75 on the low-end, up to $6.95 at the high-end. Unfortunately, the FX headwinds are much greater. We started the year with using the year-end number and that created a $0.10 drag. That's now up to $0.25 drag as a result of where the currencies are at the end of the first quarter.  Our tax rate, we still expect to be sort of 30% to 31%, a little higher it was in the first quarter. Organic growth, we think, will still be in the 3% to 5% thing with the Q1 being strong, Q3 organic should be strong, second quarter probably not as strong and the fourth quarter, if we get normal, year-end activity should be pretty strong again.  We are going to raise our full-year cash flow to $925 million and we established guidance in the second quarter with $1.59 to $1.64, which recognizes the FX challenge that we will have there. Next slide. If we look down at the summary before we open it for questions, we had basically record results across the board in the quarter, which is a nice way to start out with Roper Technologies. Organic growth at 5%, with Medical and RF driving mostly all of them. Operating margins at astonishing records at 28.7% and free cash flow up 24% to $250 million, demonstrating the importance of focusing on how much cash people generate versus sometimes people looking too much on the net earnings number.  We deployed $590 million on those three great acquisitions, the pipeline is terrific. We have a lot of things open that we are interested in and several things that we are really excited about. We do think we will have a record year in 2015, just powering through the end market challenges we have in some of our businesses. And we are able to raise our DEPS and cash flow guidance even though the FX headwinds increased by another $0.15 a share.  So with that, we would like to open it up for questions for the first time for Roper Technologies.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you, good morning everyone and congratulations on the name change. 
John Humphrey: Hey, thank you. 
Brian Jellison: Good morning Deane.
Deane Dray: Just to start off, may be expand your comments on the market share gains at Roper Pump, just the timing of this is pretty impressive that despite all the worries about oil, you’ve got the ability to grow market share. Are you getting price and are you building backlog in that business?
Brian Jellison: Well, the thing you want to balance that off with is that, we invested in a new facility that gave us larger diameter opportunities to provide product in the drilling side of the business, and that came live in the second half of last year has been building. So we have favorable comp in the first half of this year where that continues to go up.  The upstream business on the core pump technology was okay in the first quarter, but we expect it to be off throughout the remainder of the year. And in the second half of the year, we will circle up with the comps from last year. So it will still be better than a year ago and it helps us at the expense of certain other people that we are making those products. In addition, these drill things get relined. So that’s like a continuous thing that happens no matter what the level of new drilling is should get the relining and that’s a significant business, which is what we do in Houston.  So all that’s good. But you still have to moderate that with the fact that the absolute core portion of the upstream pump business will decline throughout the year.
John Humphrey: And as far as the second part of your question, Deane around pricing, it’s bit of – well, it’s really been a technology provider more so than a broad line supplier to the end market in total. So we have very niche applications where in many cases, we are the only person who can really provide the solution that’s being required. So as we went through all of our quarterly reviews as far as the things that we did ask about and test, but so far that’s not a concern for us. I think that’s also reflected in the fact that gross margin continues to be very strong inside both the Energy and Industrial segments where it was 55% in Energy and 50% in Industrial. So that’s really the proof with respect to price, if that’s holding well then gross margins generally hold well.
Deane Dray: Thanks. And can you provide some more color on the restructuring actions that you’ve taken. I know Roper is not big on doing any centralized head quarter directed restructuring. So on the $1 million that’s been done so far, is there more to do and what kind of payback are you expecting?
Brian Jellison: You know, the payback comes within the year itself, so it’s – these are always just discontinued activity and a reduction in headcount. People are very quick to do that. We had everybody together in December challenging field plans for 2015, which we thought were optimistic and unfortunately we were proven correct. So, early in the first quarter as they were monitoring January and then February, they took actions in February based on the first level of trip equilibrium. I think they have other things that they could do in the second quarter and then they generally would be around equivalent stock. There aren't any plant sections to close or things like that, it's just not how the business works, there is very light factory footprints at the end of all those businesses. So we don't have anything planned in Q2, but I think you have things more to deteriorate further, they take out more people.
Deane Dray: And then just last question from me. Was the Black Diamond divestiture, was that the divestiture that you talked about a small divestiture you're contemplating, is that the one and could you size that for us please?
John Humphrey:
--:
Deane Dray: Great, thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Shannon O' Callaghan at UBS.
Shannon O' Callaghan: Good morning guys.
Brian Jellison : Hey, good morning Shannon.
Shannon O' Callaghan: Okay, on the 60% growth margin in the first quarter, maybe just a little more color on that, I mean, as you said, up 140 bps is a lot, and to see that in 1Q. A little more color on what drove that, where there any mix things that were unique to the quarter or how much of it sort of sustained itself?
Brian Jellison: Yeah, if you look at, industrial is about 50%, which was the same as it was before, energy was 55%, its quite similar to where it was and RF was 54%, up a little bit but medical at 74% gross margin. So, as it drives a bigger and bigger every increasing piece of the enterprise that really helps and then, frankly pricing is holding quite well for us across the board in all four segments. And people have been very focused here on gross margin and they’re very focused on asset velocity, so it just gets constant attention the way we look at our business model.
John Humphrey: And this is a situation where the mix effect is the result of strategic actions that we have taken over the years, right. So, those areas that have higher gross margin was generally our higher quality businesses, they are higher quality because they are providing a service, they're providing a solution that they’re able to get paid for. And so that quality measure and our continued investment in those areas is reflected and the fact that our gross margin is higher.
Shannon O' Callaghan: Okay, great. And then just, on sort of, then I guess the non oil and gas parts of energy to some degree, you've got the organic revenue growth in the first quarter down 5%, and FX down 5%, so total down 10%. For the year, you're saying, down mid-single, oil is not expecting to get better, what does get better there in terms of easing pressure or I guess improving growth for the year?
John Humphrey: So it's going to be the non-upstream portions of that business. So the other markets that are served there, which aren't oil and gas related which is about 40% of the segment. And then, frankly there are some things that are expected to occur on the downstream market, particularly for our CTC business and some projects that they have very good line of sight on. Some of those have been lower on the decision making, so I think you've started to see that but those are still things that we expect to see with still investment around the world and things like L&G plants and other applications. So it's going to the non-upstream but you're right, we don't expect the upstream to get any better.
Shannon O' Callaghan: Okay, great thanks a lot guys.
Operator: Moving next to Steve Tusa at J.P. Morgan.
Steve Tusa: All right, good morning.
Brian Jellison: Hey, good morning Steve.
Steve Tusa: Can you just talk about the -- I guess just in general what the -- kind of second quarter organic number is going to be?
John Humphrey: Well, we’ve to look it all again in the second quarter. Expectation is that we’ll also be somewhere in the probably 3% to 5% range, probably closer to 3% and 5%. So, that’s kind of what’s baked into our guidance and expectation for the second quarter.
Steve Tusa: Okay. And as far as the kind of midpoint to midpoint, I mean, you have some things moving around here. Obviously, kudos to you guys for being able to raise the guidance when others are clearly cutting. Could you maybe just walk us midpoint to midpoint? You gave us the forex headwind, tax little bit of a headwind. How much of the offset is on the EPS line is on from acquisitions?
Brian Jellison: Well, the acquisitions are about the same as the FX. [00:01:04]They’re pretty close to neutralizing the X, which is really good, generally you know they’re going to be strong cash accretion, but actually they’re going to be EPS accretive. So, they largely make up for that FX headwind that went up by $0.15.
John Humphrey: And rest of the operations -- and rest of the operations, Steve, we’ve some puts and takes by segment versus what we thought maybe 90 days ago both industrial and energy are little bit weaker than what we thought but that’s more than offset by the fact that medical and our toll and traffic businesses are better than we would have expected 90 days ago. So, the continued push in those areas and the performance out of those businesses is doing a little bit better than the weakness that we see on the energy side.
Steve Tusa: Right. And then just to confirm, so, obviously, if you guys are doing around closer to the 3% in the second quarter, there are things that kind of pick up for you in the back half of the year on the kind of getting you comfortably within the 3% to 5% range?
Brian Jellison: Absolutely.
John Humphrey: Probably so.
Steve Tusa: Okay. And then one more question. Just -- Brian, maybe just the state of the union on the deal environment?
Brian Jellison: Well, it’s kind of encouraging, we got a couple of deals that people were trying to sell that did not get done, which is a nice early warning indicator for people who may not have adjusted their valuation expectations. And you got a lot of people who are interested in getting deals done because it’s not quite clear how the high yield credit markets are going to hold up here in perpetuity when guys are looking and say, 450 basis points spreads on high yield. There is amazing amount of different opinions around how that goes, but there is a great deal of assets that are in the marketplace for sale. I just think you have to work harder than ever because a lot of the best things have traded in the last couple of years and some of the really great things that are out there people are kind of holding off on until next year, but given the fact that we want to deploy another $1 billion, $1.5 billion in the next 12 months, we don’t really have. We’re going to see a challenge around that, it’s easy to do. It’s getting harder to find $2 billion deal right now than it was two years ago, but I’d say it’s a little bit better environment for transactions than it was.
Steve Tusa: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question is from Christopher Glynn at Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks, good morning.
Brian Jellison: Good morning.
Christopher Glynn: Good morning. So, just had a question about the levity in the margin at RF and what are the takeaways there between volume leverage mix and then maybe productivity or value-based pricing? I know there was some succession there.
John Humphrey: You mean -- I’m sorry, you said that with respect to RF?
Christopher Glynn: Yes.
John Humphrey: So, what did you see in RF for this quarter, particularly, is very strong performance and high shipments of tags and associated technology from our toll and traffic business. So, Chris as you know, we have -- inside there, we have the very consistently high margin software businesses. And so, the variances are generally going to be driven by our toll and traffic business. If you have more project work, then it adds pressure on the margin, but if you have more hardware, tag and technology shipments, then you have margin upside and that’s what we saw this quarter. So, very shipments for the Infinity Lane system as well as additional tags being sold and shipped to Texas and Florida and lots of other places, North Carolina, et cetera, Oklahoma also. So those tagged shipments help us out on the margin front and that was the case for the first quarter.
Christopher Glynn: And is there a long-term shift underway towards more favorable mix within toll and traffic?
Brian Jellison: What's happening is that there are, Infinity Lane Technology is really very proprietary, right, so more and more people recognize how much more effective it is as a technology than other things people have used for a very long period of time and I think it will be for some considerable period, longer, a bigger piece of the pie and so as that happens, that's very beneficial.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. And then on a separate matter, to what extent are MHA and Sunquest now identifying some of the deals and how -- with these properties, how is the deal sourcing process evolving, is it becoming more distributed?
Brian Jellison: Yes and no. What happens is that they have really wide platforms that you can add things to and there are a lot of small niche businesses that can be helped by joining up with either an MHA or Sunquest and they are very well known to us. So there is a long list of things that we could continue to build out, but we are also building the human capital inside both these businesses quickly. So we've added the people that are running Data Innovations and software and Strata. These are really great people. And so they bring with them the ability to make bolt-on stuff and get it integrated much more effective than some of the other businesses we’ve owned in the past. So that's helpful and there are a lot of small players. I mean we've invested $900 million in the last nine months, but we’ve done six deals to do it and our general ammo would be we would have done $1 billion transaction like an MHA.  So having the leadership teams at MHA and Sunquest makes the acquisition -- capital deployment investment situation easier for us. Now that said, we are still doing it here and so we will bring those management teams with us, but the decision around capital deployment is going to remain at the headquarters.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Congrats on the recent deals.
Brian Jellison: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Richard Eastman at Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman: Hi, just a couple of questions. Good morning, Brian. Good morning, John. Just a couple of questions on the tolling business, traffic and tolling business, was the Riyadh order, was that booked in the first quarter here?
Brian Jellison: Part of it.
John Humphrey: Yeah. A very small portion was in the first quarter, but the bulk of that was in the second quarter.
Richard Eastman: Was in the second quarter, okay. And then you said, is that the Infinity… Sorry.
John Humphrey: Rick, I'm sorry, I misspoke. It was booked in the first quarter.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then is that for the Infinity Lane system, does that project include that?
John Humphrey: No, it does not. This is a signaling and traffic management solution, so the trends with software as well as all of the other work that goes along with putting in a modern traffic management system inside a very congested city is what that project is. So it's not a toll solution, it's a traffic management solution.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And so just conversely then as Riyadh starts to ship in the second quarter, the margins in the toll, in the RF business probably settled down a bit with that mix? Is that a fair way to think about the margin profile going forward?
John Humphrey: The overall mix, particularly at the beginning, is going to be lower. So think of it as Manhattan, where we -- TransSuite runs the traffic light system in Manhattan. So that's what we are going to do in Riyadh, but there is a lot of heavy lifting upfront to accommodate the ability to get this technology embedded everyplace it needs to be. So the technology is higher margin, but the service component with local people doing that work will be low margin and this is a lower margin stuff.
Richard Eastman: Sure, okay. And then just a quick question on the core local currency growth rate assumption, when you mention industrial tech and also the energy business, I'm thinking you had commented on the total growth for those segments, including FX. So if we just back out FX for the industrial tech business, is the core growth there still modest positive and then for energy is it -- what does that look like without currency for the full year?
Brian Jellison: Okay. So for the full year, so let me go for the remainder of the year, so for the remainder of the year, we expect energy to be about flat on an organic basis, plus or minus a little bit. 
Richard Eastman: Yes, okay. And then industrial tech?
Brian Jellison: And industrial tech is very similar. Once again, remember we are completing the Toronto project. So the completion of that project gives us about a $30 million headwind this year in total. And so including that, we expect on an organic basis, industrial will also be maybe flat, maybe up a little bit.
Richard Eastman: Okay, I'm with you. Okay, so that's really unchanged from the expectation post 4Q?
Brian Jellison: I would say it's modestly lower, but we are also modestly a little bit more bullish on the Medical and what we are seeing out of RF. 
Richard Eastman: Yes, very good. Okay, thank you much. Very nice quarter.
Brian Jellison: Thanks.
Operator: And we will go next to Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Sir?
Joe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Brian Jellison: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Ritchie: So my first question, I guess with the name change to Roper Technologies, just maybe a broader question. Any thoughts on larger scale portfolio divestitures? I know you did one during this quarter. Clearly you are moving much more towards a software/SaaS-based model, and so I'm just curious, Brian, whether that changes what you currently have within your portfolio today?
Brian Jellison: No, I don't think so. I mean all our businesses, when you look at our energy businesses or the industrial businesses, they have over 50% gross margin. So the economics of this business is similar to most of the technology company you would see that are not pure software. Our software business has outperformed software companies, our industrial business has outperformed industrial companies. So as long as we get outperformance out of these things, we think the market is incredibly smart and it has pretty idea about what things are worth and while we're always undervalued we think that it's very hard to ever get rid of anything we have here. It would have to be a compelling reason and those certainly could exist in the future, it really could. But today we think we're perfectly positioned and I think this quarter sort of demonstrates that.
Joe Ritchie: Okay, that's helpful. John, maybe following up on your comment on energy, with the start to the year down 5% on the organic growth side and the expectation to get to flat, I guess two questions. What's driving the confidence in the uptick in energy as the year progresses? And then secondly, just within the margin profile this quarter, I saw that your operating margins were down about 200 basis points. I know part of that was the restructuring. But what else really kind of drove the decline in operating margins on the energy business?
John Humphrey: Yeah, so I will take the second question first. If you look at the decremental leverage, so revenue down 10%, operating profit down 18%, if you do the math on that, it's about a 43% leverage. So you pull the one-time expenses associated with restructuring out of that. When you get down into the mid-30% range for the decremental leverage, that's not at all different than what we would expect. We actually think that's very impressive performance out of those businesses, given that they start with 55% gross margin. So they are real cost actions, real belt-tightening that has to happen and that will happen and it has and will continue to happen in order to be able to hold that decremental leverage in the mid-30% to 40% range. Now, as far as going forward, when you think about sequential improvements little bit throughout the year, like I said, it's really driven by the non-oil-and-gas portion. So our things that are selling into, whether it would be plastics or polymers or non-destructive testing, other markets that are not oil and gas related, which is about 40% of the segment, that was down modestly in the first quarter. We expect that to be up modestly as we go forward throughout the year. And then the other piece is the timing associated with some of the project deliveries at CCC, which most of those are for downstream and midstream applications, more downstream frankly. And those are things that we expect to come to fruition later in the year. So those are the drivers for why we expect the minus 5% organic in the first quarter to be closer to flat throughout the rest of the year.
Joe Ritchie: Okay. And then just a clarification there. The decremental average that you talked about organically, that didn’t include any pricing pressure in the quarter, and is the expectation as the year progresses that price will continue to hold?
John Humphrey: For the specific areas that we play in, that is the expectation and I wouldn’t separate it out as pricing versus cost, I would separate it out as gross margin. So gross margin was actually flat in the quarter versus last year for Energy at 55.4% and we expect to be able to hold our gross margin very similar to what we had last year in this segment, which on a full year basis was right at 58% and we see no reason that that won’t be the case this year as well with the actions that have already been taken.
Joe Ritchie: Okay, great. I mean, one last question Brian on the free cash flow conversion that was really impressive this quarter. I know that some of that must have also – the acquisitions must have buoyed some of the conversion, but your free cash flow conversion has been moving up steadily with the acquisitions that you have done in Medical and Scientific Imaging.  The question I have is, is the 130% conversion target that you – that we have used kind of like a long-term target, is that the right target, or are you continuing to move above that target as you progress over the long-term?
Brian Jellison: Well, I think the 130% is what we have said is a trailing 12-months actual with $851 million in free cash flow. So our cashbacks isn’t going to be moving up, it’s going to be 1% to 1.5% of revenue and our operating cash flow is going to continue to escalate a little bit. It’s already best in class. The conversion rate, we always talk about it being expected to be above 120% over time, so actually the 130%, it’s kind of crept up above that.  The things that we have will continue to improve a little bit, our legacy business actually just have been improving. They frankly tripled their cash return on investment in the last decade, which nobody recognizes and the acquisitions help. But I don’t think our conversion ratios are likely to change dramatically. They’re enormous and I just wish we get more people to talk about our real cash earnings instead of talking about the DEPS number, not commenting enough about the non-cash intangible amortization stuff. 
Joe Ritchie: Okay, great. Thanks for the clarification.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Sprague at Vertical Research.
Jeff Sprague: Thank you, good morning gentlemen. Just a question around the Medical businesses, Brian. You know, if I think about a lot of your businesses historically, they have kind of been portfolio companies and have not particularly integrated. But it seems like that is now starting to happen with some of these software deals and it obviously makes a lot of sense. It’s kind of dizzying to think about how many software systems a hospital might have, and if you think about all these different things, you’re starting to put together.  I guess the nature of my question really is, is there a significant opportunity to do that? Do you move to kind of a larger provider of software systems with kind of different modalities and things that you’re selling out of a bundle or do you see these businesses actually remaining fairly separate, maybe there is a few that overlap?
Brian Jellison: Well, that’s a good and complicated question. It’s absolutely true that there is going to be more interaction between some of these niche businesses that are acquired that are smaller with the two big footprint businesses MHA and Sunquest than we would have had in the past. If you think about Neptune, we never added anything to it except they wanted to have this rugged mobile DAP business we rolled over on it [ph] and never really went anywhere.  In TransCore’s case, we have made acquisitions that have been very strategic. Several years ago, we acquired this company called United Toll where United Toll has become the entire technology leadership position around the world on toll traffic with this Infinity Lane Systems, very critical acquisition that we made and it’s kind of fully integrated and gets sold as a bundle. 
Brian Jellison: When you think about MHA, I don't think many things necessarily would be sold as a bundle. SoftWriters can continue to be sold and MHA's product branding would continue to be sold, they’re going to work in an integrated way with one another and in many cases, some of these niche acquisitions will report to the MHA or Sunquest platform business. So that's why we suggested that they were transformational in the way that Neptune and TransCore were transformational, on three and four. I think we are a little surprised, if somebody would have asked us your next $900 million of deployment would be in one business or six, we would have thought it would be one, but they are so great and so good that we are happy to do those and I think there will be more smaller acquisitions that are closely correlated. Now that said, they’re still all going to be individual niche businesses. We are not going to be the forward rush man to hospital administrator, so a lot of different stuff you pull out of the back.
Jeff Sprague: That makes sense. And the three deals that you did in the quarter, can you give us a sense of the annualized revenue run rate of those? I guess there was some impact in…
Brian Jellison: We think those were going to be up to maybe $100 million of revenue with about 40% EBITDA over the next 12 months.
Jeff Sprague: Okay.
Brian Jellison: And also, we had a huge tax benefit in these deals that are really significant.
Jeff Sprague: And we see those tax benefits in your cash flow, but not your reported tax rate going forward, is that correct?
Brian Jellison: That is absolutely correct. So it's north of $100 million of gross tax benefits that we will recognize over the next 12 to 15 years. So it is a reduction in our cash taxes over that time frame.
Jeff Sprague: And then just one last follow-up, looking at these working capital changes and thinking about John's answer, maybe it was your answer, Brian, about the gross margins in medical, what percent of your business now runs on negative working capital?
Brian Jellison: Not enough, but it’s certainly helpful. We wouldn't have gotten from 14 plus percent to 5 without having several businesses that have negative working capital and most of the acquisitions that we are making now are going to come in with negative working capital. We’re going to get paid in advance for the work that they do, not always, but sometimes they get paid a month in advance, sometimes, they get paid three months in advance, sometimes, they get paid a year in advance on subscription.
John Humphrey: Interesting. So in terms of the negative working capital, so more of the things that we have acquired or looking at are more on the subscription software, so they’re SaaS businesses, which generally don't run with quite as much negative working capital as a license software does, because you have the maintenance that is almost always build a full year in advance, whereas subscription software is going to be built either monthly or quarterly. And so it's not as much around trying to become even more negative as it is continuing to grow those areas that have the high subscription revenue and wonderful balance sheet that comes along with that.
Jeff Sprague: Great. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the question-and-answer session for this conference. I’d like to turn the program back over to Mr. Humphrey for any additional or concluding remarks. Sir?
A - John Humphrey: Thanks, Laurie and thanks everyone for joining us with our first quarterly call as Roper Technologies. We look forward to talking to you with our second quarterly call as Roper Technologies as we finish up the second quarter. Thanks.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, once again, that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for joining us.

Operator: The Roper Industries Fourth Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. Today’s conference is being recorded. I’ll now turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Audra, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss our fourth quarter and full-year results. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller, and Rob Crisci, who Heads our Planning and Investor Relations for us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. Our press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our Web site at www.roperind.com. Please turn to Slide 2; we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we’ll be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our filings with the SEC. You should listen to today's call in the context of all that information. Now if you please turn to Slide 3, today we’ll be discussing our income statement results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation which is available on our Web site. For the fourth quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted consists of two discrete items. First, a purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue and our recent software acquisitions, FoodLink and SHP, which we completed in the third quarter that totals about $1.4 million. As a reminder, this represents revenue that absent our acquisition those businesses would have recognized. In addition, we had an inventory step-up charge for IPA for about $400,000. And now if you please turn to Slide 3, -- sorry Slide 4, I’ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. After his remarks, we'll take questions from our participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. We will try to get this call finished before snowstorm. So, if we start with the Q4 enterprise financial results, we had a really terrific year with a great strong finish here in the fourth quarter. We had all-time records for incoming orders, revenue that we build, net earnings, EBITDA, cash flow. Organic revenue in the fourth quarter was up 7%. We had pretty much broad based growth every place or operating margins in the quarter reached 30.1%, which was up 110 basis points, and the operating leverage was pretty spectacular in the quarter at 47%. We will comment about leverage going forward with our guidance. Net earnings were up 13% to $187 million, or a $1.85 and operating cash flow was up sharply, a billion dollar run rate there to $261 million in the quarter, up 11% with free cash flow in that same kind of category. It’s very little CapEx this year, about 1% of revenue, so very strong fourth quarter. Next slide. We look at the income statement here, you can see the orders were up to $924 million versus $900 million a year-ago, up 3%; book-to-bill was 0.98x, but so we said before sort of 0.97x to 1.03x is the normal spread. But in the fourth quarter, our book-to-bill was always very low -- relatively low because we’ve so much more year-end invoicing. So really that book-to-bill of 0.98x is not a problem, and we finished the year at 1.0x. Revenue was up 7%. We had about 2 points of negative foreign exchange headwinds here in the fourth quarter. Gross profits stayed at remarkably high-level, here about 60%. The operating margin as we said before had 47% leverage, and that was just strong across the board as you will see. The tax rate was 60 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of last year, which gave us about a penny and a half, so you can see the DEPS number at $1.85 versus last year’s $1.65. Next slide. Cash flow performance in the quarter was spectacular. We had 140% operating cash flow conversion and a 136% free cash flow conversion. Our cash flow has been growing as you can see if you look at 2012 and then ’13 and ’14. That’s an 11% CAGR on operating cash flow in the last two years, and our free cash flow was 23% of revenue, which was about same as last year’s 23% of revenue, pretty spectacular number. We still think cash is the best major performance, and if you follow our free cash flow and you follow the continued growth, then I think you’d get a much better understanding about the quality of the Company’s businesses. Here we start the full-year enterprise results, next slide. If you look at the full-year income statement, orders were above $3.5 billion. They were up 5%, and the book-to-bill was exactly 1.0x. Revenue was up 9% with organic up 6% for the year, which was certainly in the wheelhouse of what we established this guidance at the beginning of the year. Gross margin for the full-year was up 70 basis points to 59.3%, and our operating margin was up 120 basis points, and for the full-year, we had operating leverage of 42%. We used to talk about -- well, I can go back to 25% to 30%, and then it was 30% to 35%. Recently, it’s been 35% to 40%, and we’re going to suggest that forward guidance for us is going to have operating leverage at 40% or above on the next dollar revenue. Operating income was up 13%. Earnings before tax were up 16%. Tax was a headwind for us this year as we suggested it would be at the beginning of the year. It was 29.9% versus 29% last year. That caused an $0.08 headwind in our earnings, but even with that $0.08, we still produced $6.42, up 14%, and the GAAP number of course was up 19% on earnings per share. Next slide, in terms of EBITDA and margin, on the left hand side, you will see EBITDA has increased over the last two years by 30%, from $925 million in 2012 to $1.2 billion this year. That’s a $276 million increase. On EBITDA margins, we continue to improve margins, I think rather spectacularly. In 2012, our EBITDA was 30.8%, and people were saying, oh boy, you’re going to have to revert to the mean now. You will be back down with everybody else in the 20s. Well of course, quite to the contrary, that’s just wrong. We were 32.8% last year, and 33.8% this year, and that’s all about our governance system and the quality of our businesses, record EBITDA performance. Next slide. Here again, you see a tribute to the governance model, what we have and the field execution. Our asset-like business model inventory now running 5.1%, receivables at 16.1%, and the way we look at the working capital number, you can see it’s dropped from 7% two years ago when people thought that was an unbelievably good number to now 5% at the end of this year, so our guys continue to understand how to execute our asset-like business model. Next slide. If we look at the strong financial position and the balance sheet of the Company, it’s certainly a powerful balance sheet with a lot of powder that we’ve intended to use. You can see that cash has gone up to $610 million, a lot of that’s not in the U.S., but our cash and undrawn revolver gives us a $2.1 billion capacity. The trailing 12-months EBITDA now has gone up to $1.2 billion, so our gross debt number at $2.2 billion is 1.8x our EBITDA, and we’re going to be quite comfortable if it’s at least a turn higher. We will discuss our activity that’s going to be occurring in the first quarter and throughout the year later, but we still believe we’re going to deploy about $8 billion over the next five years in transactions. Next slide. We will get into the specific detail now on the segment. If we look first at the revenue growth by segment last year, you’ll see in the left hand side, on our organic basis, energy was up 5%, industrial technology with half of which is Neptune was up 7%, our Radio Frequency was up 5%, and Medical was up 8%. If we look at the total revenue, growth by segments you’ll see Medical was up 16% as the acquisitions added to the organic number. Next slide. Here we look at the overall segment performance on a dollar value and EBITDA basis, so that you can get some better clarity on the fact that RF and medical represents about two thirds of our total EBITDA progression and its well over half of our revenue now. So the original sort of Energy business is the smallest segment we have at $692 million, still outstanding performance with $226 million of EBITDA in the large section. First time that we’ve ever had $1 billion segment in Roper, so you now have Medical with 1,082 million in revenue pretty good solid standalone entity with $472 million in EBITDA. Next slide. If you look at the oil and gas component of the Company, that the legacy of the Company was oil and gas, and up until through 2007, it was a pretty big portion of the overall Company. Today it’s a very, very small portion. Our upstream represents 5%; our Medical, RF and Software Water markets were 86% of the Company. And the downstream, midstream which is actually going to have modest growth this year is about 9%. Now with the slides showing you in addition to the breakout here, our upstream business is about 5% of revenue. Some of that’s in the Energy sector, and some is in the Industrial Technology sector where Roper Pump resides. We have even though the market we think will be down 20%, perhaps even a little bit more, where we’ve a benefit in that Roper Pump has these technologies that we launched and the new facility to get a broader categories of those into the marketplace quickly in Houston a year-ago. Well, those shipments didn’t really start to occur until the second half of the year in any level. So we’ve an easy comp with the first half of 2015 and those products in which we’re gaining share, so that will mitigate what normally would have been a deeper decline in upstream. In our Field Service and Retrofit activity in midstream is actually continuing to move up a little bit and then we have the refinery instrumentation businesses in the field service associated with that also which will have modest growth. One of the things we did in December is we had all of our oil and gas people in for a couple of day meeting where we did a focused review to recast what they had originally submitted for 2015 projections, we had them bridge the risk by customer and by category, by product line. We reviewed the contingency plans and the triggers that they had in place. These guys are world class and nimble execution as they need to do stuff. They’ve made a few changes already and are monitoring activity routinely. In fact, Friday we had a dust up on exactly where we were January to date. I have to say that, the momentum is actually as good as it was in the fourth quarter. We really aren’t seeing anything related to product follow up at all. It’s above our expectation through the first three weeks of January, which doesn’t necessarily mean anything, but there has not been any early indicator yet other than project delays and what you hear from other people who aren’t really determining their CapEx plans for later, but most of our products are not going into CapEx driven activity. The guidance that we’ve established and we’ll talk about reflects the up-to-date business expectations of all of our oil and gas people of January 23 and as I say the product activity hasn’t slowed. The other thing I think is I’ve read some of the commentary about the Company is people thinking that there are some way to ascertain something that happened in 2008 or 2009 for our Company, and I guess we just fail to do a good enough job to remind people who we’re. If you look at 2008, we added CBORD in February and then later in the year we added Horizon and Getloaded and Techlog [ph], three software companies, and those weren’t in full-year for ’08. And then if you look at our acquisition, since ’08 where people are doing comparisons, we’ve added United Toll, which is a software system that’s driving so much of our growth in TransCore, the iTradeNetwork, Verathon, Northern Digital Medical, Ascention Medical, Managed Healthcare Associates, Sunquest, Strategic Healthcare Programs last year, Innovative Product Achievements last year, FoodLink and now Strata Decision Technology, all these are either medical or software companies that created over a $1 billion in revenue, that’s in our numbers today that wasn’t there in 2007. So to say there are some Quid Pro Quo [ph] on this just the life and the reality of who we’re and what we’ve become. Next slide. Here we look at the Energy Systems and Controls sector. We can tell you that there is about $125 million of revenue upstream out of our total Energy Systems and Controls business. You can see in the fourth quarter their operating profit was up 11%. Their OP margin reached 36.1% of 280 basis points and EBITDA for Energy in the fourth quarter was 39%. Organic revenue was up 4%. We had very significant strength really in these -- some of the businesses that people think are going backward, so which -- as far its now or not. So our diesel engine shut off safety systems was up in the high teens and so was vibration monitoring. Field service growth continued, but we did see project activity declining at CCC or postponement. So that’s something that we will be watching carefully throughout 2015. As we look at guidance establishing for next year, we look at upstream declining, which is about 20% of the revenue in the segment. And then we think the midstream and downstream, we will have very modest growth and that represents about 40% of the total segment. And then the non oil and gas businesses are another 40% of the Energy Systems Control -- and Controls segment. So when we net it all together with declines in the upstream, modest growth in the non oil and gas arena of the segment, we think we will come in flat to modest organic growth for the year. Next slide. Here we look at Industrial Technology. In Industrial Technology we have about $75 million of upstream revenue in the entire segment, and oil and gas sort of split a little bit between the upstream, not much downstream in the segment, maybe another $25 million at the most. Here you can see that organic growth was 13% in the fourth quarter broad-based throughout the different businesses in the segment. Our Ropers -- Roper Pump had all-time performance records. We continue to win new customers with the newer technology and the product investments that we made over the last two years have really driven substantial revenue growth, and certainly help us as we get the end market follow-up and net activity. We had growth at Neptune driven by strength in the U.S market. We are starting to see that Toronto project wind down and we will talk about that here in the guidance. We have double-digit growth in Material Analysis and the OP margins in our industrial segment, in the fourth quarter, you can see we’re 31.4%, up 190 basis points and EBITDA hit $74.3 million at 33.8% of the revenue. So in guiding in 2015, we think Roper Pump share gains will support flat revenue for them in total despite equity steep decline in the market. Neptune we think will continue to grow in the U.S. The Toronto project completion is expected in the first half of next year. You can never put your finger exactly on that, but they’ve been moving at a faster pace than they originally suggested. We’ve had continued -- we expect continued growth in Material Analysis, although you got some currency issues with Danish krone and then we’ve got the modes organic growth we’re saying in the segment in whole, only because the Toronto RF project completion should occur sometime in the year and that could really create about a $25 million to $30 million divot [ph] in the segment on revenue, which is the bad news. But the good news is we’ve got another RF product that’s going to offset all of that and then some that we will talk about as we look at the Radio Frequency Technology segment next. So next slide. So here we go into RF Technology. We will just talk about the good news here. We were awarded a substantial contract for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Traffic Management System. This will be using our TransSuite Software Transportation Management System. This is totally different than trolling now. This is the stoplight transactions in Midtown Manhattan. There's a lot of installation management in this project, which of course is lower margin work. It’s a five-year contract to support it post close. We do expect it will completely offset the Toronto wind down Neptune, even though both our RF business is one happens to report in industrial now and one in RF. So now we look at segment as a whole, you can see that revenue was up just slightly. Toll and Traffic Infiniti Lane Project Execution remain very strong with favorable variances, both in Texas and Florida. We had terrific subscriber growth in our Freight Matching businesses, DAT and get loaded. And iTrade strength in the U.S was pretty good, but unfortunately offset by the U.K. weakness and problems in the U.K. with that business. Technolog declined, another U.K. based software business in the utility industry, but bid activity was pretty strong and Technolog tends to be a little bit up and down kind of business and should be up again in 2015. So then if we look at the -- in addition to that OP margin at 28.4%, EBITDA for the segment was $82.4 million at 34.3% and RF now represents 26% of the enterprises EBITDA. In addition to the Saudi contract that was awarded, we do expect additional scope in the foreseeable future around this, because the Riyadh of course a very important city that only one in many. TransCore’s backlog and quote activity is going to support segment growth for 2015. And the Toll Tag growth that we’ve enjoyed recently is going to continue, particularly, in Florida and Texas where people continue to migrate to our very small stiffer tag as opposed to the plastic boxes that so many people in New England still use. Software and SaaS businesses are going to continue to grow mid single-digits, very high margins. They draw up a lot of cash that allow us to make reinvestments in their own businesses or by bolt-on things for them. And the segment we think at the end of the year will have the single-digit organically. So next let’s look at Medical. I think this will be the last time in a call that we will be able to contain Medical on one slide. As you can see we worked very hard to try to achieve that and pretty much made it, but I don't think all that's going on there everything we know about will allow us to do that ever again. So prepare yourself for two slides in 2015. So here we are with a very strong fourth quarter, up 12% revenue. OP was up 15%, operating margins 35.5% aren’t the real story here. The real story here is EBITDA. We delivered $126.3 million in the fourth quarter in EBITDA, which was 43.9% EBITDA margin. Really the way you have to think about the segment now is that its medical products in one leg get software and service in another leg and then the residual life science imaging component that we have in there. Organic revenue in the fourth quarter was up 9%. We had double-digit growth at MHA with share gains and favorable end markets which continue. Sunquest growth continued; we had some customer implementation that customers delayed into 2015 that we thought was interesting, which is fine with us. New products at Verathon really drove spectacular growth in the fourth quarter at Verathon and we like to think that’s going to continue throughout 2015. Our imaging family improved somewhat with Gatan had a strong quarter, which really led that growth. And Gatan has shifted much more emphasis around life science. It used to be kind of split between physical science and life science, but with the new technologies we’ve introduced in the exceptions of the K2 camera technology and filters, more and more life science is coming our way. And the last bullet point here SHP, which is strategic healthcare programs, and IPA, Innovative Products performed really well. They’re certainly on track with what we thought at the time we acquire them and probably have better forward growth than we might have guessed. As we think about 2015, I think we have to start with the context of understanding that MHA and Sunquest are really truly transformational for Roper. They’re more transformational today than Neptune and TransCore were in the early point of the audit. They’ve really great focused opportunities to build on each one of those businesses, Sunquest and MHA, including acquisitions that the number of acquisitions we can make as much broader than anything we’ve ever had. One disappointment around Neptune is it's done exceedingly well, but we haven't been able to acquire things, because its competitors are less than exciting and most of the people we see in this space were not the kind of companies we’d want to own. Thank goodness Neptune has outperformed all those over these years. TransCore we’ve been able to build out somewhat through acquisition, but mostly it's been organic growth. But Sunquest and MHA are different story. MHA is capturing new opportunities, its benefiting from favorable demographics. Its acquisition and strategic healthcare programs was really the first addition that we’ve the MHA in the third quarter of 2014. We expect another one is going to happen yet within this quarter. Sunquest had this moderating growth for 2015 because of the meaningful use upgrades that have been driving such high-level growth in the recent past, but our investments in eternal development of things we’re doing with partners that we aren’t really able to talk about yet and the opportunities that they’ve in front of them are really exciting. We are likely to announce another important acquisition here soon that relates to Sunquest. So both MHA and Sunquest I think you will see continued acquisitions building those very large platforms down the road. The Medical device businesses are on a pretty solid growth path for 2015. We think that Verathon’s going to continue to have its market share gains and product replacements going on. And then we just last week announced our first deal of the year won’t be the last. And that's Strategic Decision Technology which is a company run by Dan Michelson in Chicago. It’s a very exciting company with a new product. It’s a small company of kind of low -- just turn past $30 million of revenue, but they’ve been growing at 20% in the last three years and now with an infusion of capital from us, they’re going to able to continue to raise that growth spectrum. They have a new phenomenal product, which is so important for the country around by cost containment, cost improvement for hospitals. Their StrataJazz platform has been running at number of hospitals in a variety of ways, but the new programs that Dan and his team are going to be offering that came out of a project that they did for Northwestern Hospital -- University is really spectacular. In total, then for the segment we think we will have mid to high single-digit organic growth for the segment by the end of the year and I commit to you that we won’t crowd the slide. We will just do two in the future. Okay, now 2015 guidance. Here if we turn to page, so a full-year guidance we established at $6.70 to $6.94 and -- but we put a good deal of energy into looking at this. The organic revenue growth for next year we think will be around 3% to 5% and that’s after completing adjusting for the newer macroeconomic trends that people have seen since December 30th to now. Operating profit leverage we can probably say will be above 40%, and that's pretty good by anybody standards. Our foreign exchange rates going to hurt us. All of our guidance is still predicated on the year-end numbers. We think that's going to cost us about $0.10, which is inside these numbers. If the dollar continues to strengthen even more, you’d have a little bit more risk. It could be as high as twice that number if today’s rates lasted for the entire year, it got worse. The tax rate we think will come in around 30% to 31%. That’s about a nickel headwind into the comparative earnings at the midpoint. So it could be a little higher if the tax rate got higher last year. If you remember, it was 29.9%, so we’re hoping it will be around 30%, but it could certainly go up to 31%. The guidance of $6.70 to $6.94 gives you a mid point of $6.82 is excluded in the future acquisitions that will occur or any divestitures. And the full operating cash flow we’re establishing at the beginning of the year would exceed $900 million of operating cash flow for 2015 with our normally strong cash conversion. First quarter we established DEPS at a $1.47 to $1.53. It includes Strata, but it excludes any other acquisitions that will happen in the first quarter or any divestitures that could occur. Next slide. So here we look at the 2014 summary and 2015 prospects. So Q4 we had record performance, very strong finish to a terrific year. For the full-year, we achieved record results in all these categories, orders, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow. Revenue was up 9% with organic up 6%. Very significant financial achievements, sort of threshold level activity where you see operating profit exceeded $1 billion in the Company for the first time, margin at 28.2%, 42% operating profit leverage. The EBITDA exceeded $1.2 billion for the first time and EBITDA margin got all the way up to 33.8%. Free cash flow was 23% of revenue and we expanded our Medical and Software platforms with three acquisitions of Strategic Healthcare, Innovative Products and FoodLink. And these three deals which were smaller than the things we’ve done recently are really a precursor or some of the types of outstanding businesses you’re going to see us continuing to add in Medical and Software where they’ve higher growth characteristics that tend to be somewhat smaller revenue businesses, and there are a lot of these that we’re involved with as we speak. In 2015, we expect to have record performance of Roper despite the fears around macroeconomics. We are going to deploy over $1 billion. We are very confident of and the year could easily be more than that. The first deal Strata we talk about a little bit, but it’s not going to be the only deal in the first quarter, that’s likely. I think it’s important as we close out the call and get ready for the Q&A here that, we are really well positioned in 2015, because the company really, the emergence as a technology platforms and our ability to deploy capital are slightly more important than many of the macroeconomic considerations in markets that so many people talk about. So, we’re looking forward to a great year in 2015, and with that we would like to open it up to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] We’ll go first to Joe Ritchie at Goldman Sachs.
Joseph Ritchie: Hi. Good morning everyone.
Brian Jellison: Hi. Good morning, Joe.
Joseph Ritchie: So, I guess, I’ll be bracing myself for the -- the second slide on Medical and Scientific Imaging coming next quarter. But the, the first question I have for you guys …
Brian Jellison: That won't be very important in that second slide that term, Scientific Imaging. Think about medical and software, Joe.
Joseph Ritchie: Fair enough. So, I thought, look, good quarter, good year. Brian, I know that your company has undergone a significant transformation since the 2008, 2009 timeframe where we had energy prices implode. But a lot of the acquisitions, that have occurred -- has occurred outside of energy, and the question I have is really on the energy portfolio. And how has that evolved really since 2008, 2009 where you just see some pretty significant organic growth declines during that timeframe. I’m just trying to get a sense for how the portfolio there has evolved? How you expect to have a more resilient earning stream in energy during this downturn that we’ve seen?
Brian Jellison: Well, certainly, a big part of what happens in energy is our [Verathon] technology, which has been very important for the continuous operation of what's going on with fracking. It doesn’t require new wells. It doesn’t require rig count or anything else, and we didn’t have that technology in 2008, that’s only just appeared really in 2013 and ’14. So, that’s like an additional business that wasn’t there previously. We also acquired a software control company called the United Controls for CCC that offers various things that we didn’t have out of CCC in terms of dealing with different types of gas turbine engine technologies on a retrofit basis and that’s useful. We had online software that we added to our PAC business, Cambridge Viscosity and Trinity Software for CCC. So, we’ve got some things that continue to grow and aren’t related to rate counts and upstream activity. So that’s good. I would say though, there are businesses that are in oil & gas are spectacularly great businesses. They have EBITDA margins that are consistent with the overall enterprise EBITDA margins; and it’s pretty much or best in class activity. Thank goodness, the vast majority of their activity is not upstream. Well over 60% of those businesses are downstream and midstream, and so that helps a lot.
John Humphrey: The other thing I would say, Joe is that, also who wants to learn from the successes that we had and what did occur in these businesses during 2009. Well 2009 was really a demand shock. It wasn’t that price went down, and therefore everything else went down. The price went down because everything else went down. All right, so let’s understand that we don’t see an enormous decline, so therefore the large installed base that we have around compressor controls and instrumentation for PAC, which really serves the midstream and downstream markets, those will continue because those are more throughput driven, and we don’t see the 15% kind of immediate demand of shock across not only that segment, but the entire world that we saw in 2009. So, we want to make sure that we are very nimble in the way that we act, and particularly on the upstream side where it’s always a little more cyclical than the rest of the oil stream market.
Joseph Ritchie: Okay, that’s -- now that’s helpful color guys. And I guess, just maybe one follow-up here. You talked about, historically your incremental margins being in that 35% to 40% range, but here you continue to do 40 plus. As you head into 2015, your growth rate is going to slightly slower than ’14, at least that’s what you’re projecting today. And you had some headwinds in that RFX business in 2014, and so I’m just trying to get a sense for your confidence in that 40 plus percent incremental, and how are you guys thinking about that across the different parts of your portfolio?
John Humphrey: So, I mean a little north of that number in medical, given the underlying margin structure, and the amount of software that we have not only there but also in RF. When we look at Industrial and Energy, that’s where we’re probably a little more comfortable in the 35% to 45% range, right a little bit wider variation there, because not as much of it is the consistently high margin that we see across the other two. But in terms of confidence going into 2015, we have a lot of confidence around that. I would demonstrate in our ability to have that type of leverage not only around 2014, but also in previous years, and with the contingent mix towards more technology, I think that’s a reasonable expectation for you.
Brian Jellison: Yes, I think you’ve got to remember in 2015 that most of the incremental revenue, which will result in the operating profit leverage is going to come from RF and from medical. We’re not going to have a lot of incremental revenue in energy and industrial in 2015. So, I wouldn’t worry so much about the -- what that ratio is, because its -- it maybe a very high number on a very small base.
Joseph Ritchie: Yes, that’s a fair point. I’ll get back in queue guys. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll move next to Shannon O'Callaghan at UBS.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Good morning, guys.
Brian Jellison: Hi. Good morning, Shannon.
John Humphrey: Good morning, Shannon.
Brian Jellison: Welcome back.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Yes, thanks. Good to be back. Hey, maybe to start with medical. Brian, you sound very optimistic there. Just curious, how much of that is related to just where Roper has evolved to in the M&A opportunities you’re seeing versus how much you actually see the overall medical market getting better out there?
Brian Jellison: Well, we got a lot of different businesses here, right. So, if we look at our medical products businesses, those things are getting driven not so much by demography, but by product technology that we continue to introduce and they are high margin businesses. We do a lot of reinvestment in them, and they really have market leading technology. So, they are not really driven by some aggregate number about demography or a medical market. Then if you get to our Sunquest and MHA, our businesses which are software and software like, they are -- they have a lot of demography benefits. I mean, there’s going to be more testing, not less testing. There is going to be more needs for post acute care. There’s going to be more activity around Hospice and nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities, and all those things that MHA does so well. We’re certainly going to bowl on some acquisition this year for MHA, and you’ll see we’ll just reinforce all those things in a big way. So, they are creating markets more so than anything else. I mean, these guys really are the leaders in that market place. People do read across on us with somebody, well they read across for Sunquest, if you look at Cerner. So look, they’re doing well, we’re doing well, epic is doing well, the space is doing well. If you look then at the life science business, that business, it can has sort of preemptive technology related to filtering and camera technology for life science, things that you’re looking at, molecular biology. So, it’s a great space. It’s going to do well. The other ones which are very small really are less medical. They’re really more about nanotechnology and development in the physical sciences. So, that has less derived demand than the others do.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay, great. Now that helps a lot here, thanks. And then, I’m just -- obviously a lot more volatile world here so far in 2015. How do you think that’s impacting the M&A world? You obviously sound very optimistic that’s related or unrelated to the volatility. But is this all a good or a bad thing in terms of what you think you can get done out there?
Brian Jellison: Well, the M&A world hasn’t changed very much. When you think about the world in which we participate which is really primarily acquiring companies from private equity. So, we’re not out shopping around for public companies if you see a distorted value or something. We tend to think public company’s acquisitions are problematic for the most part. I mean, it could happen, but it’s not where we’re looking. So, the only good new development in the M&A front is that, there’s a lot more pressure on the banks to limit their debt to EBITDA staples to six times or five times. And most of the last several years, debt staples have been seven or seven and a half, mezzanine coming on top of it. So private equity could put in three year four turns of other peoples money and use debt at extremely high leverage ratios, and be very definitive in the acquisition market. So, pretty much our competitors for -- when we think about who our competitors are and this is a capital deployment company at its core. We look at all the large private equity guys. We love them, because they own a lot of stuff we want to acquire. But we’re not willing to go up to four or five or six time’s debt to EBITDA, and they start at six or seven time’s debt to EBITDA. So it’s still a tough market for us.
Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator: We’ll go next to Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Brian Jellison: Good morning.
Deane Dray: We appreciate the additional color on the -- and disclosures on the oil & gas business because obviously there’s still a lot of scrutiny there. And then recognizing this is 5% of your business on the upstream side, can you provide some more color on the assumption on the 20% market down? Because if you look at the CapEx sensitivity where oil is, you could push that to 35% down, 40% down, but a lot of that hinges on CapEx and the fall off in customer CapEx, and you said several times that you’re not so leveraged to customer CapEx. So maybe expand on that, how much is aftermarket? The retrofit and field service part of your business, and so, how do you, I’m sure that leads you to that down 20% as your assumption. So, maybe just walk through how you’re seeing that play out?
Brian Jellison: John and I are looking at each other fighting to see who wants to answer this very fair question. I mean, unfortunately there’s never any one answer, because we have a role up here with the revenue we’ve shared with you and 5% is upstream, and 9% is midstream and downstream. But while the RF products and the markets we serve are so niche that they don’t lend themselves to the same macroeconomic situation that you see with other people where you could look at rig counts. For instance, what we haven’t talked about is, how much of our business is upstream oil, and how much is upstream gas? How much is in the United States? How much is outside United States? And we’ve -- for competitive reasons don’t want to get more granular than we have, right? So, we just feel that the retrofit activity that CCC does and it already has booked and continues to do will have growth. The upstream portion that they have are related to any new LNG projects is going to be down, and it could be down substantially beyond 20%. But it wouldn’t defect us until the second half of the year, because the kind of things that we do on a project basis are still rolling along when one of our high growth small businesses is diesel engine shut-off valves which somebody had downstream, but its really an upstream business. That business last year was up 16%. So, we can imagine that it could be up, so we think it’s going to be down, the reversal will be more. So, but the only fair way to answer the question is; what if CapEx and others didn’t sell off and you had a fee of 35%, our view would be -- it would be 35% in the second half of the year, but maybe 15% in the first half of the year. So, I think those people who are writing about fears in 2016 that we’re reading everything everybody is writing. But we got no data to support any downturn yet except us being conservative and taking a 20% whack off of everything that goes into those markets. John, do you want to add to that?
John Humphrey: Yes, I wouldn’t add. Mostly I think that Brian described what our views are with respect to the guidance and to the expectations for the end market. What I would -- that I would say is that, our businesses -- one of the great things about our business structure is we have people who are very close to their customers. We have six different businesses that have some exposure to oil & gas. And so, whether it’s Russ or its Kevin or Joe, any of the guys that we know individually they are very close to their customers and can react very quickly to changes in demand. They are not waiting for us and our assumptions about what's going to happen in the macro world to set their plans. These are very quick businesses to act. The asset light nature of our business means that they don’t have a lot of fixed cost that require a long lead time in order to make adjustments to their cost structure. So, I have every confidence that these guys are very close to what's happening. We’ll be able to act quickly whether that means that the market is going to be worse than we currently expect, or it’s going to be better than we currently expect. They are not looking to us for those answers. They get to be very close with our customers and know exactly what's going on, on a real time basis.
Brian Jellison: I think we need to also add, because we probably don’t explain this well enough is that our businesses in those spaces are not the least bit capital intensive, and these are factory driven businesses. These businesses can flex immediately and they have all kinds of flexing ability with manpower. So, most of the other companies in these segments, they’ve got big factory operations. So, what happens in a downturn for them is absorption wipes them off the base of the year. We just don’t have anything like that. We just don’t. If you look at the physical asset investment that we have, and add back accumulated appreciation to that number, our gross investment is very, very small even in the oil & gas arena. These are mostly test and assembly businesses. There are only a few things we do that involve machining operation. So, a downturn to us is a lot different than a downturn to GE’s oil & gas business.
Deane Dray: Look, that’s exactly the additional color that we were looking for on why you can set a number at 20% for that upstream piece. So, that’s exactly what we were digging at. And just as a follow-up a couple here. Maybe you can flush out the expectations on the share gain for Roper Pump, just anything quantitative what happened in 2014 regarding market share, what the opportunity is? And then for John, with the FX pressures, we’re seeing a number of companies engaging for the first time some additional currency hedging and would that be appropriate for you guys?
Brian Jellison: Hedging?
John Humphrey: So, I’ll take the second one first. No, we don’t do hedging. Our FX risk is not transactional. We have a very good balance between where we generate revenue and where our cost structure lies. So, we’re not really subject to that risk. The impact that we have is the translation effect of earnings as they’re generated, whether they’re being Canadian dollars or they’re in euros or pounds. And with respect to hedging, I mean you can change the timing, but you can't change the magnitude. Eventually unless someone has figured out a way to hedge for the next 20 years, they know what the currencies are doing do and you can hedge for a little while. But those are folks that are really more plan driven, and have much longer cycles than I think our company does. So, as we look at the sensitivity, I think Brian has already mentioned the fact that we are expecting little bit less than 2% headwind from an FX standpoint for 2015 that translates to about a dime. So, we’ll have to see what the future holds.
Deane Dray: And on the market share expectations?
John Humphrey: So Roper Pump was up about 20% in 2014 with -- frankly they were up almost double that in the second half of 2014 as production ramped up for the facility not really facility driven but the fact that where the share gains required us to go ahead and expand some capabilities there. And so, it really doubled their growth rates towards the back half of the year. And as Brian said, it gives us a little bit of a easier comp in the first half of the year, because we do expect to maintain those share gains with the expansion of some of our Verathon product lines.
Deane Dray: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Jeff Sprague at Vertical Research.
Jeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, gents.
Brian Jellison: Good morning.
Jeffrey Sprague: Just a couple of things. Brian, you mentioned divestitures twice in your pitch. I was wondering, if you could just -- obviously you’re not going to identify businesses, but it sounds like you are more actively looking at that. Perhaps just a little bit more color on your thought process there.
Brian Jellison: Well, I don’t know about us looking at it more actively, but yet we certainly have had more inbound requests and we don’t even follow-up, I mean, its very rare there is anything we own that we’re interested in getting rid of, but somebody might talk us out of something. So, I think it’s possible that you could see a divestiture within 2015, but it wouldn’t be a very meaningful -- it would be a non-strategic asset if we did sell something.
Jeffrey Sprague: Okay. Could you roughly size now maybe just as a percent of the segment, the three buckets in medical now?
Brian Jellison: Three medical products, and then software [indiscernible].
Jeffrey Sprague: Software and life sciences. Yes.
John Humphrey: Sure. So, medical represents about 80% of the segment, and then its split very evenly between the medical service and technology, the medical products. Now, I’m talking from a revenue perspective now. So, 80% net, so call it 40% medical technology and service, 40% medical products, and 20% imaging. Now from a contribution to earnings the medical technology comes in higher from an EBITDA perspective, so it’s either more strong on the medical technology front.
Jeffrey Sprague: Great. And Brian, this question also kind of comes up strategically, but it kind of tweaked me to ask it. You mentioned, Cerner as a comp TradeNet some 40 times earnings or so. We do have a -- you have a very interesting unique portfolio here that’s really not an industrial company anymore. What's your thought process around the company in its current configuration?
Brian Jellison: So we like the configuration. We got a great industrial and energy business that throws off a massive amount of cash that provides a wonderful annuity for us to go out and maintain an investment grade status and acquire a lot of great software and medical businesses and that’s what we’ve been doing for a long time. When there’s a confluence of reports that you see out there, I think they fundamentally keep talking about or how are you trading as a premium to the multi industry group. It seems so high when in reality it’s beautifully low against who we actually compete against for market capital. So, at some point in time if that doesn’t get recognized better than it does from time-to-time, there’s always flexibility in what we would do. But we’re going to keep building out our situation. Now we started from next to nothing to create a billion dollar medical and software company. Our RF business is largely a software company, and industrial with Neptune, Neptune is not really industrial, it’s really radio frequency. It just reports over there. So, I think you’re likely to see more internal strategic developments around these various businesses than you are seeing something that would result in selling off a big component of it or anything like that.
Jeffrey Sprague: And then just one other really quick one, you’re at 1.8 churns and you said you’ll be comfortable to add a churn, folks call it basically 3-ish. Are you comfortable to just operate perpetually at 3 or is that kind of you flex to 3 and then you work it back down to 2 sort of thing.
Brian Jellison: Well, I think it will just depend on the quality of everything that we see. Its not -- when we model ourselves, we model very modest organic growth and kind of 2.5 times debt to EBITDA. I think when we’re below 2.5 times, we feel sort of underinvested and if we got up to 3.25, we wouldn’t be the least to concern with the quality of our cash. I mean, last year for instance we closed out year-over-year that balance sheet up $400 million in cash and we paid for $300 million of acquisitions. And if you look at $2.2 billion of powder you got to figure another, what do we say $900 million operating cash flow this year. So, be it $3 billion, it would be nice to get $1.5 billion to work over the next 12 to 15 months to keep our ratios where we are. So, at the moment we’re underinvested, but that’s because of our discipline, not because of the opportunity. And like I said, Strata is not going to be our only acquisition this quarter.
Jeffrey Sprague: Great. Thank you very much.
John Humphrey: Audra, even though we’re at 9:30, I think we have time for maybe one or two more questions.
Operator: Okay. We will go next to Christopher Glynn at Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Good morning.
Brian Jellison: Good morning, Glynn.
Christopher Glynn: Couple of questions within RF on TransCore and iTrade. TransCore, I think historically the international deals have been sort of one off and it sounds like now you’re alluding Brian to maybe more sustained skill opportunity, so curious about that. And then with iTradeNetwork just if we could elaborate on what's sort of off the tracks in the UK and how FoodLink is opening up the addressable markets there for ITN?
Brian Jellison: Well the international business TransCore is sizable and very important. I mean, there’s a lot of things we do, but they have been -- it’s not broad based. They are specific situations we’re developing a relationship with the government or developing a relationship with a particular agency, so that’s the case in Dubai. Well, people travel in and out of Dubai marvel at simplicity all of the way that traffic moves and how easy it is to buy a tag. It’s certainly not lost on any of the other Arab countries. All of them would like to be deploying these technologies. So, the Saudi’s now have this breakthrough project in Riyadh. We assume it will be widely successful, and that will encourage them to put in change orders to expand it there and hopefully over the next 10 years we’ll have a much, much larger degree of penetration around the Arab peninsula. We are very well positioned in that area to continue to grow, and if you hadn’t had the year of spring you would have seen a lot more activity than it has been able to occur. In Europe they are pretty well served today, so I don’t think we’re going to expand much in Europe, and in Asia generally we have a lot of issues when to get around the quotation. We have few, a lot -- very specific boundaries. One is, no Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that some of the people who’re competing in this space don’t seem to be bothered by that. But we’re very, very conservative in that area. So, this Saudi project is a big deal. It’s going to be pushing $100 million over the next several years, and we expect it to be $25 million or $30 million this year to offset the Toronto wind down. On the subject to iTrade; iTrade is really doing much better now in the U.S. and FoodLink is substantially ahead of the early commitments, after just a few months I think we’ve made a number of improvements to their processes, and they’ve got good leadership from their own people and our people that are supporting them. In the UK the pub businesses have been off quite a bit and the U.K’s had considerable difficulty with -- it’s really not iTrade, it’s an acquisition that the KKR people have done just before we bought it, but we would have never done. And it’s always been problematic, and it’s really more about data analytics that really ought be owned by somebody that’s in the package good analytics arena, but we’re going to try to clean it up and make it a little bit better. The end markets haven’t been very favorable.
Christopher Glynn: Great. Thanks for the story.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Richard Eastman at Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman: Hi, good morning Brian, John, Rob.
Brian Jellison: Good morning.
Richard Eastman: Brian, could you just talk for a second about Strata. Maybe give some, could you just talk about how much you maybe paid for the business? And then also, is there a tie-in with SHP here in terms of taking their accounting software from the non-profit environment to the clinical market? And then maybe just lastly on that acquisition; it seems there is a number of these smaller healthcare software businesses owned by private equity and perhaps private equity hasn’t been able to build the scale with these businesses that they might -- you might otherwise think they could? And I’m curious under your ownership, I mean, do you -- are you more confident that you can cobble these businesses together and create some scale here?
Brian Jellison: Well, we’re going to do a great job with the businesses, but it won't be by cobbling them together. We’re un-cobblers here. Consolidation rarely sustains growth companies. These businesses, when private equity owns them, they always own them with an eye to exit. So, their first year, 18 months of ownership, they’re happy to make investments, but they got to stop on a dime. And they have to capitalize the leverage they get out of those investments, because they got to get rid of it in four or five year. So it almost invariable and we acquire them, we’re acquiring something that has been under invested in for growth for 18 month or two-year period and the people can’t focus as much on their end markets, saying growth as they can when they come here, because now they can stop worrying about managing for a sale and start worrying about serving their customers and thinking clearly about where to put their resources. That’s the reason that we’re the successful acquirer of so many of these kinds of businesses. I’m sure that Barbara at Strategic Healthcare could have probably -- frankly gotten a larger number from somebody else that would have wiped out everything she built in Santa Barbara and absorbed it, because they would have wanted to cobble it together with something and the same thing would be true in Dan’s business in Chicago with Strata. So Strata is going to be a platform for us even though it’s relatively small now. It's not something that gets cobble together with Sunquest or with MHA. Now we are going to make other acquisitions, some very quickly that will be very complimentary to an MHA and very complementary to Sunquest. So there is a lot of opportunity that we didn’t have to find those kinds of things. We are always looking for great teams, great ability to grow, buying a business that’s got a little over $30 million in revenue, and to grow 20% is more interesting than buying a business at $50 million of revenue that can’t grow at all. So we are excited about that. If you noted in Strata, that’s an LLC. So the big -- one of the big things about economics here is we get a really big tax benefit. In fact, our gross tax benefit on Strata is going to be of $40 million. So that’s a major part of the consideration in the purchase price of the business and Strata is a business that’s going to have over $30 million of revenue and its going to have the EBITDA in our typical Roper kind of strategies and the purchase price is $140 million, but that included the $40 million plus of tax benefits.
Richard Eastman: Well, when I talk about -- again, when I look at their customer base in Strata, it would just seem that you could share and leverage kind of the customer basis that’s some of these other businesses say SHP, because I look at -- again, I look at Strata having been around for since ’96 and the $30 million revenue number at them. So the dynamics and the economics of that business, for their customers has improved apparently over the last five years and the demand factor there?
Brian Jellison: Yes, I think that’s true and also just the expansion that Dan and his team been able to do in terms of the product lines and the other things that helped people on the cost side. Well, what I would say is that -- look we do see opportunities for these businesses to be able to learn from each other. I know that both Strata and SHP are very excited about the product lines that each of them have and the opportunities there to be able to learn from each other. It’s always balance for us. We think there is incredible value in having a business focused on its niche and on its existing customers, particularly one with that has so much runway and ability to capture opportunities like Strata. But we do see the ability to have Strata work with maybe another market opportunity that MHA may have. So we see those as future opportunities, but we never want to have someone take their eye off the ball of the current niche focus that they have. So we’re not going to try to combine anything together. We always think if we have smart people in the room together that will be able to learn something.
Richard Eastman: I got it. Okay, well thank you. Thanks for getting the question in.
Brian Jellison: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: And that will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks. 
John Humphrey: Okay. Thank you, Audra. Once again, everyone thanks for joining us today. We look forward to talking to you again in three months as we finish up our first quarter.
Operator: And again, that does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-10-27 08:30:00) =====
Executives: John Humphrey - CFO Brian Jellison - Chairman, President and CEO Paul Soni – VP and Controller Rob Crisci - Head, Planning and Investor Relations 
Analysts: Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Steve Tusa - JPMorgan John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management
Operator: Please standby. The Roper Industries Third Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. This call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Kayla, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our record third quarter. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller, and Rob Crisci, who Heads our Planning and Investor Relations for us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. Our press release also includes replay information for today's call. In addition, we have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website at www.roperind.com. Next slide, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. Now if you'll please turn to slide three, today we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation and on our website. For the third quarter the difference between GAAP and adjusted results consists of two discrete items. First, a purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue and our recent software acquisitions, FoodLink and SHP and that totals about $950,000. That's an adjustment to both revenue and operating profit. As a reminder this represents revenue that absent our acquisition those businesses would have recognized. In addition we also had an inventory related step-up charge for IPA for about $400,000. And now if you'll please turn the slide, I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and after his prepared remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: Good morning, everyone. If we look at this first slide here on a summary to the third quarter. At the enterprise level we had record third quarter results in all of the categories. All time record on orders and backlog, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA. One of the things that was particularly encouraging about the quarter as we've really didn't have any significant headwinds in any one of our segments. I remember last year we had difficulty with Zetec and from time to time there may be something. This quarter around we really didn't have anything at the segment level. We did have better geographic results on a broader base than we would have expected while the US was certainly up. Every place was up except for Brazil and some portions of the Middle East. Our revenue in total was up 6% with organic revenue up 4% and again, kind of broad based results, all of the segments were up. Our gross margin was up 70 basis points on the adjusted non-GAAP number to 59.4%, a little better on a GAAP basis and operating margin was up 60 basis points to 27.9%. Leverage in the quarter was 39% in keeping with our guidance of 35% or more. Net earnings were up 10% to $156 million represented $1.55. Of course the GAAP basis compared to the prior year was higher than that of 13%. Our operating cash flow was $226 million, which was a cash conversion of cash to net earnings of 145%. So it was a terrific quarter for us pretty much across the board and certainly provides a lot more assurance about us reporting our record 2014 full year. Next slide. If we look at the income statement in the quarter, orders were up 6% to $893 million. Revenue was up 6% while organic was up 4%, it will be up stronger than that in the fourth quarter. Our gross margins were up to 59.4% as we set up 70 basis points, operating income up. Our earnings before tax were up 12% to $228 million. Our tax rate was higher in the quarter from last year instead of 30.3% it was 31.3% which cost us $0.02 a share. And then you can see the net earnings number at the bottom, the diluted earnings per share and we're comparing it against our non-GAAP number last year of about 42 on a GAAP basis, we were at $1.54 against $1.36 last year.  Next slide. EBITDA growth continues and our margin expansion continues. I know most people find that really remarkable, but we do have certainly some of the best operating people in the world and they continue to deliver spectacular results. In the last two years, our EBITDA is up $301 million to $1.173 billion from $872 million and our EBITDA margins have grown by 380 basis points they were 29.8% in 2012 and people telling me they would obviously max out and the direction of the mean would be taking us down to the mid 20s. Nothing could be further from the truth. We continue to grow our margins. You can see they were up to 33.6% and our gross margins similarly have expanded back in 2012 on a trailing 12 month basis at this point in the year, our gross margins were 55.2% and today our trailing 12 month gross margins are 59.3%. Next slide. If we look at the cash flow, we had better cash flow quarter here in Q3 as you can see, the important items being 145% cash conversion on operating cash flow. That $226 million represented 25.6% of revenue in the quarter and our free cash flow at $217 million represented 24.5% of free cash flow to revenue in the quarter. That brings us as you can see to $579 million on the year we would expect a strong fourth quarter so that our conversion factors stay well above the 130%. If we look at the compounding nature of cash flow which is what we get out of all of these software and medical acquisitions we've taken cash flow up from $659 million in the trailing 12 months in 2012 to $815 million this year and of course we'll have a stronger fourth quarter. It will be the 17th year in a row that our cash flow – free cash flow will exceed net earnings. Next slide. Here, if we look at the balance sheet you'll see cash grew in the quarter by $104 million. Our undrawn revolver was paid down. So despite deploying $303 million in the quarter for acquisitions, we ended the quarter with almost $2 billion in cash and undrawn revolver position, with our trailing 12 month EBITDA at $1.173 billion you can see those ratios gross debt-to-EBITDA at 2, we'd like to be higher than that. We would expect that we would easily deploy $1 billion or more in the acquisition arena in the next 12 months and it could be higher than that could reach a $1.5 billion. Next slide. Here if we look at the individual segments, they all performed well in the quarter. Next slide. The energy systems and controls we'll start with the smallest of the segments. You can see here that energy systems & controls represents about 17% of the EBITDA we get in quarter three. Its revenue was up sharply up 10% over the prior year. Operating profit was up 19%. So it had very, very outstanding leverage, only 50% leverage in the quarter. OP margin reached 28.7 and the good thing about all of that is within the fourth quarter we expect a very strong improvement in operating margins out of our energy systems segment. Orders were up terrifically, they were up over 14% in the quarter for energy. The organic revenue in the quarter you can see here was 8% with that terrific leverage. We had double-digit growth in our oil & gas products including the safety systems that are involved in fracking operations.
 : Our Zetec business bounced back from a bad third quarter a year ago to have a much more normal quarter, so much, much improved on an easy comp basis and on the aftermarket and field service for compressor controls was particularly strong, although the large project spending decisions certainly have been slow with all the geopolitical confusion you have. But despite those geopolitical issues compressor controls bookings in the quarter were up nearly 20%. We had a modest decline in our PAC business around refinery instrumentation projects, but nothing to be alarmed about. In the fourth quarter our oil & gas products continue to perform well as this oil price indicator doesn't seem to have any elasticity effect on our businesses. Again, we're much more involved in the throughput productivity side of that than in the exploration of new well side. Very strong compressor controls aftermarket and field service would be expected in the fourth quarter and this is a segment that always has strong fourth quarter results for people that have left over MRR budgets and we would think that would be the same this year. Often that benefits our instrument sales and despite having some foreign exchange headwinds which occurred in September and will of course continue in the fourth quarter, we still see very strong sequential operating profit growth in the fourth quarter. Next slide. Here if we look at industrial technology, you can see industrial technology is up to 21% of the companies EBITDA in the quarter. It had modest revenue growth, but last year was particularly with Neptune an all-time record third quarter number, operating profit up modestly with the margin was up 200 basis points going forward from the way we look at it, it will be a much stronger margin. The Roper Pumps Directional Drilling activity continued to be just really very, very good double-digit growth. The relined activity we do in the new Houston facility that we opened last year is continuing to ramp up passing its breakeven contribution and doing extremely well now and it's going to continue to perform well in the fourth quarter. Our Cornell Pump business which is the dewatering business continues to do very well. The rental markets are up strongly and the shale and oil gas production area even though rig counts may be modest or declining in some areas it doesn't matter for us because the productivity increases that you're seeing many of these places are up 20% productivity. Our products are really required for the throughput side of the equation, so they are not influenced that much by the new rig count and much more by the throughput. Our Material Analysis business has performed well and did better in Europe than we would have expected. In fact, the overall company did better in Europe than we might have feared given the headlines you see. Neptune was down slightly in the quarter against last year’s all-time record performance, still performed very well. The five year Toronto project is a bit ahead of schedule and as we looked and talked with them we think that's probably on track to get completed some time next year, perhaps around the end of the first half of the year and we continue to develop and expand our systems capability at Neptune. And one of the great things that the technology team has done there is backward compatibility for all these enhanced systems and the result of that is that people don't have to worry about a technology migration because we're really offer them an evolution that allows them to be able to use old and new technology at the same time and we're not limited by any old networks that so many of our competitors are strangled with.
 : Next slide. If we look at the Radio Frequency Technology segment, it had substantial order growth in our Toll & Traffic businesses. Last quarter, we talked to you about very important wins in the Henry Hudson Bridge in the San Francisco Bay Area projects and this quarter we've added to those with the Houston Grand Parkway and the Pennsylvania Turnpike Upgrades and Florida I-95 Express Lanes, all three of those will be in excess of $50 million in total. So all that bodes well for the future in 2015.
 : And our CBORD & Horizon business had strong operating profit as recurring and maintenance revenue grew despite having lower revenue in the fewer security projects that you're seeing at the university and K-12 [ph] level. If we look to the fourth quarter, you can see that we think we'll have kind of low single digit growth compared to last years record fourth quarter, but still better than last year. We've got substantial opportunities in growth in the Intelligent Transportation Systems solution area. We've got quite a lot of bids out. We've got some significant progress we've been making on process quotes and discussions that look like it should well position us for certainly 2015. The iTrade business has been benefited by the FoodLink acquisition that we did towards the – in the third quarter. Normally, our integration process is pretty simple and the iTrade area that was an opportunity to take some cost out and to do some other thing which is are several months ahead of schedule. So we feel particularly good about how that's performing and as you can see, the Radio Frequency segment in the quarter represents a 26% of our total EBITDA. Next slide. Here as we look at our largest segment, the Medical segment, which increasingly really is around healthcare. If we look at organic growth we were up 6% in the quarter. The device side of the business was sort of low single digit growth led really by our Northern Digital as mentioned image-guided products and some consumables at CIVCO. We had great performance, just great performance in both Sunquest and MHA. Sunquest continues to drive execution around the meaningful use implementations and upgrade which is finally getting us out at some of the backlog that we had experienced last year with Sunquest. So productivity is up sharply here. And at MHA, we've got a favorable trend in basically the spending arena around long-term care pharmacies and assisted living and skilled nursing facilities. So MHA is having of course is – really both Sunquest and MHA have spectacular all time record years. We acquired Strategic Healthcare, SHP in the quarter. It's really a phenomenal business with high growth profile. It's a SaaS provider of data analytics for the post-acute healthcare organizations. These are things like home health and hospice care. It's very complimentary to what we do at MHA. And we also acquired another company, IPA Innovative Products which is the leading provider of automated surgical scrub dispensing systems for hospitals. Pretty good timeline given everything people worry about today on disease protection and they provide a lot of productivity for the surgical suite because people oftentimes can't find their uniforms, they don't have the right size, people have to wait while people bring it and these automated dispensing criteria is just facilitate that and reduce expenses almost immediately for the hospital. If we look at the fourth quarter, we've got Sunquest and MHA will continue their double-digit growth and medical devises probably going to be in the mid single digit arena, but the overall segment even with the imaging activity is expected to have double-digit segment growth in the fourth quarter. So not only do we get that, we think we'll continue to have some margin expansion and you can see that medical healthcare was up 36% or not up 36% but represented 36% of the company's EBITDA. Next slide. So if we update the guidance – next slide, we're increasing our full year guidance from $6.27 to $6.37 to $6.32 to $6.38. We started out the year with $6.05, so we're quite pleased with how the year has come on line. Our full year guidance would be to have revenue growth around 8% to 9% with organic growth around 6% to 7%. We're going to bounce back here with organic growth in the fourth quarter at 6% to 7%. Overall revenue growth in the fourth quarter expected to be 7% to8%, fortunately taxes probably going to be 32%. And then these guidance numbers include the September 30th foreign exchange rates. They don't forecast anything beyond that. Exchange hurt us a bit as in September but didn't do much for the quarter as a whole but it's a bit of a drag going into Q4. Next slide. Here if we look at the summary of the quarter, once again we achieved records in pretty much every category you can think of. The revenue up 6% with organic 4%, but we're going to have a stronger 6% to 7% Q4 organic in the fourth quarter. Gross margins at 59.4% are pretty spectacular. Operating margins at 27.9%, but the reality is we have a lot of non-cash and tangible amortization and if you look at the EBITDA performance you'll see it's even stronger. We got 39% operating leverage out of the third quarter which is quite remarkable and EBITDA almost at a $300 million clip at a third of the revenue. We deployed $300 million in attractive acquisitions. We expect to continue the capital deployment. We've got a favorable pipeline and there are quite a few things that we're working diligently on as we speak. I don't know if any of those would close within the quarter, but they are likely to close some time sooner rather than later. We've got very good year-to-date performance through the first nine months' certainly record levels of growth and record margins and cash flow. We've raised our full year guidance again and we're confirming the strong cash conversion that we talked about well above 130%. We expect a record year. And with that, we should open it up to questions, John.
John Humphrey:  Okay. Kayla, so if you can start the Q&A portion of our call this morning we'd appreciate that.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird.: Yes, good morning, Brian, John, and Rob.
John Humphrey: Good morning.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Just for starters, could we just maybe talk a little bit to Brian about the geographic growth. You kind of touched on it in the materials analysis business. But just kind of suggested that maybe overall Europe was stronger than expected. Just maybe kind of comment on maybe what businesses in Europe surprised you positively?
Brian Jellison: Well, we had pretty deep growth everywhere in the quarter. I mean, nothing spectacular, but the only places we were down was Brazil where we expected to be and some of the things in the Middle East which are really slow just because of the political environment and decision making, but our positions are good and solid. Everywhere else grew. So Asia was up double-digits, Europe was up 3%, Canada despite some last minute currency pressure was still up in the low single digits and the US was up a little over 5%. So you know about 65% of revenue is still domestic if you will and about 35% outside North America used to be closer to 40, but as Sunquest and MHA are essentially US businesses. So that affects the thing. But the core underlying businesses are doing well globally, really other than Japan don't have any softness anywhere in Asia. Europe's industrial activity was where we were kind of pleasantly surprised. We did particularly well in Germany and given the things that you're seeing about Germany that was – and we felt good about that and orders were strong there, and then medical did particularly well in Europe against its normal outcome.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: And just from the M&A pipeline, in the M&A pipeline, what – are you seeing a lot of opportunities that are non-medical, the scientific?
Brian Jellison: Well, we see a lot and pursue a lot of things that are SaaS based or licensed software that we look at and those fall into very different categories. I mean, one of the things we're doing now would look more like an extension of Inovonics, which is our security business that has some very unique technology of the pendants if you look at the product fall and can't get our pendant lines of activities that we have that we don't talk a lot about. So there are sometimes things in that arena that we look at. In the industrial arena, we still really haven't seen anything that would fit our cash return on investment methodology. We're getting very strong GAAP based EPS performance out of fluid handling and when we look at other people stuff we just don't see people that have our margins. Our EBITDA margins in that segment are above 30% and most of the stuff we see comes in with gross margins at 30 and EBITDA margins at 16 and it depends on other people increasing demand to create any real leverage in the business.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: I see. Okay, very good. Well, thank you and congrats. Nice quarter.
Brian Jellison: Thank you. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer:  Thanks, good morning. 
Brian Jellison:  Good morning.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer:  As we look into next year, it seems like you have some nice momentum carrying through with tolling projects and the medical SaaS businesses, then there's some concern of the oil & gas markets idea, that spending might be hitting a plateau. You gave some color Brian, but maybe you could just give a deeper diagnosis of that market?
Brian Jellison: Yeah, I think the thing that was encouraging about the third quarter was CCC was basically up 20% in orders and that's an area that you would be concerned about two factors. One, geopolitical risk with Russian sanctions and anybody serving anything going into those markets and then price elasticity around Brent and WTI crude or are you worried then about rig counts being less growth even than they were. Well, it turns out you know, all of our stuff is productivity related and so it's aftermarket activity or it's improving throughput. We had a very strong Cornell pump business growth with dewatering pumps. Well, if your productivity and if you read almost anything you'll see that things like Eagle Ford, their productivity is up 20%. Well that measures throughput and they need our dewatering activity for that throughput increase. So it's less dependent on new rig counts and more dependent on throughput. Price elasticity again it’s really about usually other people’s consumption of energy and their production process. So they are still interested and that going down. So we really haven't seen any early indicators either in an industrial or an energy platform that would cause us to be concerned at this point about 2015. I think that particularly with Europe up somewhat in the quarter, that we just don't see an area of softness.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: That sounds good. And then just another area of the portfolio, since you had the new investment there for iTrade. Can you kind of update us on what you're seeing for adoption and penetration trends, market share for that platform?
John Humphrey: You know, iTrade continues to perform really well particularly in the US and their order management system. That's been the – and that was really the main reason that we acquired iTrade was because of the – what we thought were favorable trends in order management being able to more seamlessly connect the supply chain for fresh and perishable goods and the grocery chain and that is continuing to prove out to be the case. We've really refocused that business more on the US market and they kind of started to go outside the US and I think they got a little over their skis in terms of capability to deliver while they still had a – quite a bit of addressable market here in the US. So they are growing very nicely in the US, outside the US not quite as much and we really think that the Foodlink acquisition and the capabilities beyond the supplier side, all the way back to the farm and the organic farmer side will really help extend the offerings that iTrade is going to be able to have. So we're encouraged by the progress there.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Thanks, John.
John Humphrey:  Yeah.
Operator: We'll go next to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.
John Humphrey: Good morning.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Just on the deals that you closed in the third quarter, could you just give us a little bit more color on the acquired revenues or the acquired EBITDA, how to think about the multiples, how to think about kind of an accretion profile into 2015?
John Humphrey: Sure. So we invested about $300 million in these three acquisitions between FoodLink, IPA, and SHP, and in total, we expect them to deliver in the high $20 million range in our first year of ownership. So we paid about 11 time, a little bit less 11 – little bit less than 11 times first year EBITDA and given the profile for these types of businesses, extremely asset light, high amount of recurring revenue, software type of margin profile, we think that we paid a fair price, but a very good price. So we're encouraged about that. In terms of revenue, and these are going to have I think after the amortization charges it will probably be similar to the Roper margin profile. So I think you're looking at somewhere in the $75 million range for first year revenue.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Brian Jellison: And we also have a cash and tax benefit that accretes…
John Humphrey : Yeah, there's a modest cash tax benefit included in that $300 million, maybe $10 million or so.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Okay. Great. And on the other side, Brian, this has been raised on prior calls, right, and you've got some really good assets and selling incomes with dilution and things like that. But you know I've heard a little bit of chatter. I don't know how real it is, but maybe on the pump side you guys might be looking to shed something there. How should we think about the other side of kind of managing the portfolio and to your point, some of the stuff is going for high multiples and it's not maybe great assets, you've got some very good assets that perhaps will touch a very solid multiple in this consolidating environment that we're seeing?
Brian Jellison: Pretty much all the businesses are pretty good, as you say. I mean, we have only just a few product lines that are things that we wish were not part of the portfolio, but there are only a few of those. I think we do get bids from time-to-time from people about certain assets every once in awhile, we pursue then as a rule. It's hard to ever see those divestitures come to fruition because the after tax contribution is not a shareholder friendly result, right. So, if we were going to divest anything we'd want to assure ourselves that the cash from the disposition had an immediate and great home, I'm sure that there are some assets we own that, you know, would perform as well as they do with us in another place or if you have an asset that has maybe growth characteristics, but it's a very dilutive cash return profile and somebody else wants to invest in it and has a lot of synergies with it and we can get a fair price for it then we're certainly not above disposing of some of those kind of things. And I think a lot of people – our acquisition activity is just very intense and pricing is pretty high. So there are people who call us about possible divestures who wouldn't have called in the past as they are finding how much these things are really worth and they can't find anything else and ours are so much better. So it's certainly possible that you could see some portfolio adjustment in the next year.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Thank you. I was wondering if I could just slip one more in. Could you elaborate on what you said about security projects and I think you said K-12 in colleges [ph] are you seeing some cyclical let up there or is it is just kind of the programmatic nature of some of those projects, just kind of the state of those markets?
Brian Jellison: Yeah. It's really at CBORD & Horizon where CBORD in particular we had the one car technology that does everything on the campus or healthcare environment and they had some particularly big transactions the last large one I think was Northeastern University up there. That sort of cycling out and the university and healthcare campus activity decisions are really slow. So quotations are there. And what happens on the projects is there is some throughput of other people’s security hardware in addition to our systems. And so if you don't get that, which we didn't have in the third quarter much of, it brings down the revenue, but actually we had better operating results because the software portion and the license maintenance activity is at much higher margins. So what we were just trying to reflect is it didn't look like revenue was really strong, but actually the OP was quite strong.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Okay. Thank you.
John Humphrey: And at the end of the day I mean, just to elaborate on that a little bit, at the end of the day CBORD is a software business. I mean, we do sell-through hardware in order to facilitate some of the security applications, but fundamentally, we look at the software and the maintenance revenue and the new license revenue out of that business as the ongoing health and growth of that business and with the lumpy projects around security that we'll add on top of that. And as Brian said we're very encouraged by the nice growth in the maintenance revenue which is really their installed base and the annuity that comes along with everything they are providing for those customers.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs: Hi. Good morning, everyone and nice quarter.
Brian Jellison: Thank you.
John Humphrey: Thank you. Good morning, Joe.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs: My first question is this one, I'm trying to square your comments on energy, our energy team today came out with a price deck, a WTI price deck of sub 80 for next year and Brian you mentioned in your prepared comments that large projects continue to get deferred. But the bookings were really strong in compressor controls and frankly across the rest of your business. So, I'm just trying to just better understand the resiliency of compressor controls, Roper Pump, Cornell, and perhaps maybe if you could set the context how much of your business is aftermarket versus OE related that would be helpful?
John Humphrey: Well, let me address the second one first and I'm basically going to address it by saying we're going have to get back to you and we don't really think of it as OE and aftermarket as much as looking at our total exposure to oil & gas knowing that most of our applications are around throughput and efficiency and quality, whether it be in the refinery side for instrumentation that are measuring quality or throughput inefficiency like our compressor controls business. We'd have a few modest applications that are more on the upstream side, but they are on the upstream production side, things like diesel engine, shut off valves, and dewatering pumps, because there's quite a bit of water that's used even on the production side in addition to the exploration side. Very little of what we have I mean, is just kind of thinking through it. Very little goes to OEMs per se other then of course knowing you have drilling people who are doing drilling applications or production applications that I guess could be qualified as an OEM, but it's not really an OEM the way I think of it in terms of larger automotive type markets. It doesn't feel like that to me as we go through all of our businesses. And then as far as the outlook on crude oil prices, I mean, we really don't see an awful lot of that. Most of the areas where we've seen delays or at least slower decision making for some of those large projects, I think they are more geopolitical in nature rather than price of oil in nature. Brazil has been slower to make decisions around some of those things. Some areas of the Middle East not quite as fast on making some investments as what we might have expected. But it doesn't change the fact that energy is still doing extremely well. Our total oil and gas related businesses, I don't have it at my finger tips, but they were clearly up in the quarter and up on a year-to-date basis despite seeing the oil price start to come down. So, it's something that we're keeping an eye on. We definitely benefit by having very lien, very nimble organizations that could act quickly, but at this point, we still see more opportunities than we see on the risk side.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs: Okay. That's helpful color, John. And maybe one follow-up. Brian, you mentioned earlier you talked about a $1 billion to a $1.5 billion in deals over the next 12 months. Clearly interest rates have moved lower again, valuations look more reasonable. Are you seeing any greater competition at this point and maybe you could just try to compare it versus what you've seen over the next – over last 6 to 12 months?
Brian Jellison:  I don't see that. Interest rates for the M&A market haven't had any material change. I mean, if there's anything, it would be a little bit of people yelling at the banks that they are seven and eight types debt stables are a little out of control and maybe some of the European banks that have been doing that routinely should think about it. But the reality is we still see ridiculous amounts of debt financing on every transaction. We never see anything that’s less than seven times stable debt, despite what other people are saying it shouldn't be above five or six what is, it’s a lot above it. And there's a lot of private money available that's still happy to go in at sort of 5% kind of interest rates and still a lot of pick. So prices are as high as they've ever been. There's a huge amount of stuff for sale. I mean, we have gone through more conversations this year with people than we've ever done in our history and still it's just their – just a huge amount of them. I mean, we'll be out tomorrow and we'll be out Wednesday on two more where management presentations are very robust. I don't think private equity has pulled back by one penny. I think some of the strategics have sort of given up. But the kind of things we are looking at investing in are things that really want to be part of our company because of the nature in which we manage it and the governance process and the freedom and entrepreneurial people have to survive here. So we're not seeing any problem with the pipeline. We would like to make a larger acquisition than we have, but there are certainly no shortage of $2 million, $3 million, $4 million, $500 million transactions in front of us and the larger ones still such a frothy ability to issue equity that every – all the sellers who continue to talk to us haven't decided what they're going to do. But I think it's going to be easy for us to deploy quite a bit of capital here in the next 12 months in very attractive businesses. 
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs: Helpful, Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll get back in queue. 
Brian Jellison:  Yeah. 
Operator:  We'll go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa - JP Morgan:  Hi, good morning.
Brian Jellison:  Hey good morning, Steve.
Steve Tusa - JP Morgan: Just fourth quarter free cash flow and kind of the year number, what do you expect there for free cash flow percent net income?
Brian Jellison: Well, I think I don't know for the full year it should be 130%. I guess I'd have to see that for the fourth quarter.
John Humphrey: Yeah, fourth quarter should be in the range of $250 million of operating cash flow and let me take 10 off for CapEx, so that's how we spend on a per quarter basis. So we'll spend $40 million of CapEx roughly this year. So that I think keeps our full year operating cash flow conversion well above 130%.
Steve Tusa - JP Morgan: Okay. And then just for next year, these deals you did, I think you answered this in Jeff's question maybe, but it would be the accretion for next year, is like $0.10 to $0.15 the right kind of number for those deals you've closed recently do you have kind of you know, booked and locked in for next year?
John Humphrey: No, it’s…
Brian Jellison: Just think about the way we think about it, right. So, we think about cash accretion, so on cash these are sort of very high margin businesses and they are growing rapidly and they are going contribute a good deal in cash in 2015.
Steve Tusa - JP Morgan:  Okay.
Brian Jellison: On what some up based EPS number it is, is far less critical than whether the quality of the earnings and cash that they generate is pretty good. Johns talking about them being in the high $20 plus million of EBITDA. And so you can figure that out. If you care about a GAAP base EPS number, you can do the math. But we care about their compounding cash growth and they are going contribute well in excess of $25 million of EBITDA in 2015.
Steve Tusa - JP Morgan: So, the $0.10 to $0.15 converts at a higher rate or kind of the normal 130% rate?
Brian Jellison: On a GAAP EPS base, it's going to have a lot of…
Steve Tusa - JP Morgan: Yeah, free cash flow, right.
John Humphrey: Yeah, it will be in that same range. When the nature of this right of course we have non-cash amortization charges…
Steve Tusa - JP Morgan: Sure.
John Humphrey: And you always need to add those thing and tax effect those, but then add those back and so that gives us the natural increase in our operating cash flow well above the net earnings contribution.
Steve Tusa - JP Morgan: Right. Okay, perfect. Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next to John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity: Hi, good morning. First question in the Industrial business you talked about Neptune down from tough comps. Can you talk about mix of business generally? I know there's more of a technology high margin spend in this space now with flow meters and a lot of the RFs going to slightly different permutations. So if you could just comment a little bit on Neptune mix that would be great? 
John Humphrey:  Sure. I mean, the general trend in the industry is clearly is to purchase meters along with the technology embedded in that. So it's not too completely different streams and oftentimes you have water utilities that will decide to upgrade a project. And so you'll have collectors, as well as devises to be able to collect that information. So you have the collectors that will gather the readings and send them back to the central office and also mobile communication devises. But as a rule, most of the revenue for Neptune is going to be the meter technology, plus the radio and embedded encoder technology. So you can gather all that information and be able to send it back to someone. And usually those are not purchased separately. And so we're having a split, I mean, still over two thirds probably closer to 75% of the new shipments for Neptune, the new revenue is the integrated meter or some integrated technology rather than just a meter that goes out that's still being direct read. And so that's where we see the market continuing to trend with the total systems purchase rather than the individual pieces. 
Brian Jellison:  Yeah, let me just make it clear that. That I wouldn't accept the premise that Neptune's down. We just said that they had an all-time record quarter in the third quarter of last year, so might be down a $1 million or $1.5 million compared to the prior period. But they are going to have likely a record year this year and they are having a very strong first nine months of the year and then they are going to do okay in the fourth quarter. So let's be careful about how we phrase that compared to the competitive marketplace out there with other people who have old technology and have pretty mediocre revenue. 
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity:  Yeah, I know that's fair. I'm just going off slide 12. And so lastly on my – the Medical and Scientific Imaging, I'm sorry if you mentioned this, geographic splits there, is that primarily North America or anything else internationally? Thank you. 
John Humphrey:  Sure. I mean, for this segment in total, it's not at all much very dissimilar. What you have is our medical products and medical software businesses, Sunquest and MHA, as well as our Verathon and other businesses. Those are probably a little more skewed to the United States. But our Imaging businesses are more global in nature. So when you look at the segment in total it's about 70% US, 30% outside the US, but the differentiation there is that our outside the US portion is more imaging in our camera businesses rather than our medical businesses. That's still – and we're growing very nicely in medical even with US focus and still see the international opportunities still ahead of us. 
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity:  Thank you.
Operator:  We'll go next to Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management.: Good morning.
John Humphrey: Hi. Good morning, Alex.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: Can you hear me?
John Humphrey: Yeah.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: I wanted to go back to this question of the $1 billion to $1.5 billion that you hope to spend in the next 12 months. How much have you spent this year? Do we have that total?
John Humphrey: $303 million I think.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: That's it for this year? So far…
John Humphrey: Yeah, we didn't spend anything the first half of the year and we did the $303 million in the third quarter.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: So that really explains why when you're looking at the growth for the year, you've got 6% to 7% forecast organic and 8% to 9% total. So you really haven't added all that much revenue this year to the total. When we talk about next year what would be, do you have any idea of the timing of that spend whether it's in the beginning of the year or the end of the year and in other words what's it going to add to revenue?
John Humphrey: We will really never know the timing, Alex. I mean, we had the diligence that we do is very time consuming and everybody that's been through our process understands. So while we can process a lot of stuff simultaneously. We're almost always looking at least four things at any point in time and you just never know whether they get into the finish line. We don't have a budget for acquisitions and we always want to do the best thing as opposed to just doing something. So when you get to acquire something like IPA and SHP, I mean, we have one of the thought leaders in the world with probably running SHP and some phenomenal business very, very, very exciting for us to do that and we could have done a couple of other things that would have had larger revenue, but don't have the compound cash growth that we like. So it's very important for the acquired management team to be able to fit into our culture. People have a good deal of freedom, but for the same token they've got to have a thorough understanding of cash return and where we want to exploit multiple channels of distribution and how we think pricing should go and how you should invest in R&D. And candidly most people don't have those values. They just wait for cyclical markets to change. But our people have to really evolve markets and they've got to have a long-term view of what it is they're doing because they are the ones that are driving the applications in the marketplace.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: You alluded to the fact that you are looking at companies who really want to join Roper as opposed to some big industrial conglomerate or whatever. But if they are owned by private equity investors, do they really have the say in who they want to be bought by?
John Humphrey: Well some do some don't. It really depends on – when the private equity guys own the business, if the management team will not convey to a new private equity owner then the private equity guys have to behave very differently. Sometimes the management people have a desire to go through and 5 year situation where they can't invest in the future and hope for an exit that will be okay, but the kind of people that want to work here don't think that way. They've been inside private equity for awhile. They want to invest to grow their business over the long-term and we're a great home for people who want to invest and grow over the long-term.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: One more follow-up. Roper Pump is ramping up in Houston. What's the capacity utilization now? In other words how much further can you ramp it?
John Humphrey: Oh! We could double certainly from where it is today. Its got – it has some sophisticated process equipment that's running three shifts, but most of the activity is only on a one or a shift and a half basis and the people that we're providing product to are releasing more and more of their content and a lot of what they are doing in Houston is called relining of these drill bits. And so, it's not – you know, and the answer, it’s really on the exploration side that has to drive their growth as long as they're continuing to operate. These things have got to come back to be willing because they wear and that’s the Houston thing is a big relining operation.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: Okay. Thank you.
John Humphrey: Welcome.
Operator: That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Kayla, and thank you all for joining us. We look forward to talking to you in late January when we release our fourth quarter numbers.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Please standby. Roper Industries' Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call will begin now. I will turn the call over to Mr. John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Tina, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss results of our record second quarter. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, who Heads our Planning and Investor Relations for us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. In addition, we have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website at www.roperind.com. Next slide, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. Now if you'll please turn to slide three, today we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter primarily on a GAAP basis. Prior period results are presented on an adjusted basis for comparison purposes. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our website. Now if you'll please turn to slide, I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. So we open up here, if we look at our enterprise financial results for the quarter, they were once again truly outstanding. We had all time record orders, record backlog, closing out the quarter, record revenue within the quarter, record net earnings in a quarter and of course, another record for EBITDA performance. Our revenue was up 13% in the quarter on a GAAP basis but 10% on an adjusted basis, which is the way we really look at the quarter. Organic revenue was quite substantial plus 8%. For us it was very broad based, all four segments were up organically, which was nice to see, but certainly, medical and RF had blow up kind of performance on an organic basis. Our gross margins just continued to go up. It is a remarkable achievement, up 120 basis points to 59.1%, which is really why we call a Roper Technologies this days and not Roper Industries. Operating profits up 18% to $247 million in the second quarter. Our operating margins up another 180 basis points, clearly above the gross margin improvement and 120 basis points, and operating margin came in at 27.9%, which includes a lot of amortization too. Hope so you add that on top of, I know, the number is even stronger. Our DEPS in the quarter on an adjusted basis were $1.56 GAAP against last year’s adjusted number were up 19% on a GAAP basis, GAAP to GAAP were up 41%. And operating cash flow in the quarter was an additional $141 million, which was 14% better than the prior year. So we are very well-positioned to show record year in 2014 for the company along with delivering just an outstanding second quarter. Next slide, if we look at the income statement, you can see that even though we had a very strong revenue quarter up 10% with organic gain. Our book-to-bill was virtually 1, little bit of lumpiness in RF with TransCore. We will talk about but that’s not unusual. If we look at the gross profit as we said it went up from 57.9% in the second quarter of last year to 59.1% in this quarter and operating margin went up from 26.1% last year to 27.9% this year, interest expense was a tagged less and our tax rate was just little bit lower than it was a year ago 70 bps. Net earnings we talked about it $156 versus $131 were really again broad based on a segment by segment basis. Nest slide, here if we look at the EBITDA growth and the trend in the company. We tend to show you a couple years of trailing results at a time, pretty well served to remained people, if you go back to 2003, our EBITDA was about $125 million, not the $1,153 billion that you see now on a trailing basis. And our EBITDA margins were in the high-teens, not the 33.5% you see today. So that’s why the company really has become much more of the technology company with higher margins, more sustained than continued performance. And these very high margins up 420 basis points on an EBITDA basis and the last two years alone really allow us to reinvest internally for growth at a much faster pace than Roper would have been able to do 10 years ago or even five years ago. If you look at the gross margins, which were probably I don’t talk enough about, you can see in 2012, trailing 12 months performance was 54.6% gross margins. Back in the 10 years ago gross margins were always higher at Roper say 50% or so. But, certainly, didn’t have the kind of reinvestment in gross strategy back than that we do today. 450 basis point improvements in gross margin is something we are very proud of over the last two years. Next slide, if we look at the cash flow, cash flow in the quarter, $414 million of operating cash flow and $130 million free cash flow, really resulted from the fact that we had very little cash tax due in the first quarter about $25 million and we had $132 million of cash tax here. As economics patriots we are. So you wind up with quite a high. Now the tax paid in second quarter. It’s about $107 million more than it was in the first. Those things tend to level themselves out over the course of the year. Our first half operating cash flow, you could see represents 21% of revenue at $353 million and our free cash flow at $333 million is up 15% over last year. We expect outstanding cash conversion throughout remainder of the year and our total operating cash flow to revenue will be as it has been in years past continuing to grow. In the metric you see here, $845 million of operating cash in the last 12 months and that’s up from $620 million, just two years ago, so 36% improvement in operating cash flow during that two-year period. Next slide, we look at the asset like business, again, astonishingly good numbers. Two years ago we were below 10% and people were marveling about our ability to get there. But we certainly haven’t given up any of our internal strategy, so you can see we reduced inventory from 7.2% of revenue two years ago to 6% now and our payables and accruals have expanded from what they were two years ago. You can see that the networking capital the way we define it inventory plus receivables minus payables on accrual has dropped from 9.5% to 6.2%, so that’s 35% improvement in just two years. On next slide, if we look at the balance sheet, the strong financial performance always gets best scene, when you compare your balance sheets. The year ago our cash was $375 million, today its $565 million and our undrawn revolver is virtually at -- they just very little grown against it. So it gives us a cash and undrawn revolver flexibility to invest $2 billion. More importantly, you can see the gross debt has dropped by $513 million even after doing the $1 billion MHA acquisition last year. So we continue to pay down debt pretty quickly. The gross debt-to-EBITDA number is below 2, 1.9, our willingness to have a debt level than that our debt tolerances is certainly much higher than the kind of number you see here and that coupled with the reality of having a couple of billion dollars to deploy. We would expect to have pretty rapid cash deployment aggressively over the next few quarters. We would -- we think you will see some things now and some things later in the year and much larger things probably next year. Next slide, here we look at the segment detail for each one of the business. Next slide, looking at energy systems and controls, you can see was up organically 5%. Again had strong revenue out of our compressor controls business driven by both midstream and downstream installations. We had decent growth in our instruments and consumables business and service for refineries. And then we had much better demand certainly kind of resurgence in Canada with oilsand activity and various things that have to do with. Our pressures sensors we have and things that have to do with these line in shutoff valves and what have you. Our book-to-bill in the second quarter, even though organic was up 5% was still at 1%. You can see total revenue was up 7%, a little bit of contribution from small acquisition we made last year. Operating profit up 8% and OP margin improved little bit to 27%. Organic growth in the second half of the year for energy, we think to be pretty strong in the third quarter, probably a little less than that in the fourth quarter. But over the balance of the year should be fine. We do have this sort of mid single-digit outlook for the segment for the entire year. I would be better if we saw return to large project activity that’s pretty slow you can see that with everybody that’s in the oil and gas side of activity. The geopolitical ambiguity that could get worse, could create project timing issues and slow decision making. Notwithstanding that, everything else is strong, so the aftermarket products doing very well, field service is also doing well. We have an easy comp in the second half of this year, because Zetec will be back to its sort of normal type of activity, which will be substantial increase over last year’s this point third quarter. And the oil and gas end markets remained pretty favorable, particularly with the oilsands getting stronger and the prices associated with Canadian products going up. Next slide, we look here industrial technology you’ll see we had continued great results out of Neptune. They grew revenue and also had better margins in the quarter. U.S. was particular strong for Neptune and Neptune was awarded an Amazon Web Services Award for what’s call the City on the Cloud Invocation Challenge. They have a program called N_SIGHT which is trademark N_SIGHT IQ which helps municipal water companies manage the flood of water data that they get, which there sort of really equip to deal with and this allows us either to host or provide software that makes it easer for them to understand the data that they have and respond the questions about from users. I believe there is a, I think, you can see YouTube video about that too. Roper Pumps continues to have great business in the Directional Drilling Applications that we’ve talked about in the past. They continue to gain share from other people. And our Material Analysis business stores at Denmark had particularly strong equipment orders and sales of their Hardness Testers which is good news on that handle of their lower margin items and it did impact their margin some as equipment grew much faster than the consumables and that’s something we think will rectify itself in the second half. I would point out Industrial Tech which had operating margins of 29.5%, which are beyond world-class and they were up 100 basis points sequentially from our first quarter operating margins. In the second half of the year, we think we’ll have little bit better organic growth in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. Some of those businesses tend to get year end benefits. We expect for the balance of the second half to have kind of mid single-digit revenue growth in the segment, but with very strong margins and excellent cash contribution from the segment in the second half. Two double-digit growth type things are, our Cornell pump business is going to have very strong second half as the rental market continues to add capacity for pumping stations, we are tracking back alive and well. And Roper Pumps’ strong demand and increased capacity, means we will grow double digits there and we will have better margins as they get leverage out of that growth, certainly stronger than it was in the second half of 2013. Next slide. Here if we look at the RF Technology businesses, everything in here is quite spectacular, although we had fairly soft booking -- book-to-bill period, the segment came in at 0.96, which is certainly not unusual. But everything else was really just amazing. We had an absolute all-time record for TransCore in terms of revenue for the toll and traffic operations, the projects that were underway in Florida, Texas, and California, Virginia all performed very well. Actually Q2 enjoyed some pull-in from project execution effectiveness that we would have not expected until end of the third quarter, so that benefited us in the second quarter. We had some really important wins in the area. We got San Francisco Bay area, expressly in convergence, which were extremely hard thought by everybody in the industry and we were selected, that will be over a $50 million project. We got the Massachusetts Department of Transportation back off extended that’s a big contract over a decade 250 million bucks. We’ve got the Henry Hudson Bridge which is very strategic thing because New York, New Jersey tolling is the largest agency in the country and that’s not an agency we have had much with. So, again, our technology being preempted allows us to kind of get a foot in the door there which will be a -- we think forward predictor of how well we are going to do there over the next several years. We had great tag shipments in the second quarter which benefited the revenue which you can see is up 10%, OP up 17% in the quarter. We also had some strong sales out of our RF security products for all of us who go through airports and look at the TSA agents, who probably don’t know that now everyone will have little pendent so people know little bit more about what’s going on there and we received the award for those pendants which will start to ship here in the second half of the year. Our SaaS business is continued to grow so to modestly in the quarter, but they are growing. The College & University Security Projects though were little lower than last year, because we have finished North Eastern University which was a very big install, profitability was actually better for CBORD because the installation business is always carries a very modest margins but the revenue was not up a lot in the quarter for that. In the second half of the year we will expect kind of low signal-digit growth. We’ve got a couple of headwinds that are probably going to pull down our overall organic growth but we’ll grow organically in the half of 2014. Our Toll and Traffic projects are going to continue to remain at high levels, but we saw a lot of those last year, so the comps will be a little bit more difficult even though the numbers will be high. And iTrade was able to make an acquisition that closed on July 2nd called Foodlink. This was really a technology acquisition that reminds us of United Toll Services for TransCore. And what they do is they provide the traceability sort of a farm to fourth basis, so we are from the grower if you will to the in-store purchaser of products, which are fresh and one wants to know where they came from and how long they have been in transit and all this traceability factors are things that iTrade could acquire from others but now will have its own technology, be able to do this makes it much easier for the stores to deal with iTrade on a broader network basis. So we’re encouraged by that. Our next slide. We look at the Medical and Scientific Imaging segment. You can see it just continues to be spectacular. The organic growth in the second quarter is up 12% after being up 7% in the first quarter, suddenly led by medical. Sunquest had an all-time record quarter. There is meaningful use implementation and our ability to approve Sunquest’s ability to execute really paying huge dividends now, lot of upgrades in the hospitals. And we continue to invest very aggressively internally in Sunquest to capture more of the anatomic pathology and genomic testing opportunities that we see ahead. That’s lot of internal investment in there but we’re also very active in the acquisition pipeline area around those areas. We’ve had very strong performance at MHA with a lot of new members acquired for both long-term care pharmacies and long term care facilities that results in management area and facilities, that are encouraging for them. We also had that double-digit growth at Verathon with new and enhanced products. There are several things we’ve talked about and in the second half, you’ll see this Titanium GlideScope which is kind of a break through product for certain applications. We’ll continue to drive that growth and enhance it in the second half. Our Northern Digital business image-guided surgical had a phenomenal quarter and based on orders and their flow of activity looks to continue that throughout the second half of the year and Scientific Imaging continue to improve up kind of mid-single digits in the quarter on a revenue basis. In the second half of the year, we probably come in just under double-digit growth, just with imaging continues to be modest grower, where as the rest of medical we expect to have double-digit growth. New and enhanced medical products and measurement were about Verathon’s titanium GlideScope being the biggest single product but there are actually quite a few others and enhancement made to our BladderScan product. Both Sunquest and MHA will deliver double-digit growth in the second half and that certainly means more than 10%. And then I would say -- I would expect that you’d see announcements from us throughout the year about possible things and that will have occurred in the acquisition pipeline area. There is a lot of very attractive small companies that we’re working with and a few larger ones as well. So we’re very encouraged by what’s going on in the space. Our next slide, if we look at the guidance update. Turn to next slide, we are increasing the full-year DEPS guidance from $6.22 on the low end of $6.27 and high end to $6.37. We think revenue grow should come in for the four year around the 8% to 9% and organic growth should be around 6% to 7%. Now the organic growth when we started the year at the end of 2013, January quarter, we are established organic guidance of 4% to 7% and then as we went into the second quarter, we move the organic guidance up to 5% to 7%, as we had -- continue to see more strength. And then now we’re moving it up to 6% to 7% for the full year with the 8% growth, we enjoyed in the second quarter. So the organic growth has been very strong through out the year for us. Tax rate for the full year, we think it will be around 31%, it was 30.4%, I believe in Q2. We have some FIN 48 roll-offs that occurred in the third quarter last year that’s probably going to make it difficult to have a tax rate that’s as low as the 30.3%, we enjoyed last year. So we’re going in with the assumption it will be about 32% which will cost us a few pennies in the quarter. Revenue growth in the third quarter, those should be up 5% or 6%. So we established DEPS guidance here at $1.49 to $1.53 and I think our revenue in the third quarter will be somewhat similar, little bit above hopefully in Q3 which is sort of a typical very new pattern for us but certainly up nicely from the third quarter of last year. Our next slide. If we look at the summary for the second quarter, it was just an extraordinarily great quarter for us. In addition to having all these nominal numbers of records with orders and revenue and backlog and net earnings and EBITDA, the variables were really good with the revenue up 10%, gross margin up 120 to 59.1%, operating margins up 180 bps to 27.9%. The leverage was just phenomenal in the quarter. For those of you who are without your calculator, you’ll see our operating leverage was about 46% in the second quarter which is why getting any nominal growth is so powerful here at Roper. Our EBITDA was up 14% to $295 million and we’ve raised our full year guidance and we had just an excellent first half performance with these record margins of organic growth. We think our full year cash conversion will again be outstanding like it was last year. And our current acquisitions discussions remain mostly in the medical and software, they are very active with lots of opportunity and have very powerful balance sheet to take advantage of them. So with that, John, I think we’re positioned for both a record year and questions from the investment community.
John Humphrey: Okay, Tina, can you go and start the question-and-answer period?
Operator: Yes. Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We’ll take our first question from Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc: Good morning. Couple of questions, first, Brian, can you talk about the sustainability you see in the growth you’re experiencing in Sunquest and MHA just looking out over the next couple of years? And also sort of fold into that, what you think is going on with market share. And I obviously recognize there is a larger recurring revenue component here. So I just want to get a feel for what you think these normalize out?
Brian Jellison: Well, we’re going to expect double-digit growth for some time out of Sunquest that areas that we’re taking them into are very exciting areas. There is a lot of opportunity in the short run. You get the benefit from meaningful use requirements to take care of government regulation and in the long run, you get many new forms of testing with us having just a very unique way to capture that. So we’re very positive about the long-term prospects for Sunquest, whether it turns out to be a high single-digit grower over the next five years or modest double-digit grower or substantially more, it’s hard to say. It generates lot of cash. It gives us a lot of money to add from acquisition view point and certainly when I think about what we’ll do organically there, plus the acquisitions we’re going to make in that space, it will be one of those, if not the most exciting business we have along with MHA.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc: And just as a follow-up, you’ve definitely seen more incrementally upbeats on you M&A prospects looking out over the next couple of quarters. Can you talk about on the relative size of the assets you’re looking to acquire the multiples and that you might -- would be willing to pay here knowing this is a tough environment?
Brian Jellison: Well, we could but it wouldn’t be our interest to what sellers know what we might be willing to pay for anything about. So -- Matt, it’s hard to say but we said generally we like to not pay over 10 or 11 times first year EBITDA, that’s something that’s absolutely true. Yeah, sometimes, you maybe a little higher and sometimes you maybe lower but if you look at a blended basis, we think we need to be investing at a clip that’s $1 billion to $1.5 billion a year and sometimes we’re ahead of that, behind it and there will be different price values based on the kind of cash flows that we can see from businesses. But over time, we still kind of think of modeling our acquisition growth with debt-to-EBITDA, somewhere around 3 or less, could be higher from time to time and looking to have a blended acquisition first year number around 11 but it could be higher. And we’re trailing -- selling in a trailing 15 times enterprise value multiple and the people that are like us in market place, many of them are 20 to 25 times. So these are very high value to assets. But I would have to say that we’re not seeing difficulty again in what we think it will be our ability to close transactions in the next several months, having to do with pricing. I think pricings are high but rationale.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc: Great. That’s all I need. Thanks Brian.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Deane Dray with Citi Research.
Deane Dray - Citi Research: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
Brian Jellison: Hey, good morning Deane.
Deane Dray - Citi Research: While we’re on the topic of M&A, just if you would clarify one point here Brian because definitely you’re standing little bit more positive in your ability to close deals. So what’s changed in past quarter in terms of your being more optimistic here? It didn’t sound like pricing has changed but is it the availability of assets and more active discussions but certainly you can see something has changed?
Brian Jellison: I’d like to say that we like to mix the things that we’re involved with and we feel like we’re making a lot of progress and talking to people we haven’t decided whether they’re ready to engage or not. So that all feels pretty good. Usually, when we get -- as we get further and further down the line, there is a lot of people that have an orientation. They wanted to get something done before the end of the year. So it’s getting closer than the end of the year and there is a kind of seasonality that probably shouldn’t be there that is. And the things that we’re involved with now that we really like, more diligence we do the better, we feel about them. And so those are all encouraging. And there is just a lot to say, I think that you’ve got unbelievably powerful management teams in some of these arenas. In medical arena, and some of the software arena, so we have that really give us an ability to make bolt-on things for these guys that frankly we didn’t have before we have these two big legs in-house. And so when you get back to being able to pick up some really great businesses that not each one is a $1.5 billion that we have to drive, it increases your confidence about being able to execute and deploy cash. We need to deploy cash in the next year. We’re not interested in sitting on a balance sheet with gross debt-to-EBITDA at 1.9 or net debt at 1.5. That’s in our view not acceptable.
Deane Dray - Citi Research: Great. That’s helpful. And could you clarify on the RF business, you mentioned there were some poll-ins related to project effectiveness. Just kind of flash out that point, what were the businesses and can you quantify that portion that was build in?
Brian Jellison: It’s pretty much all the TransCore project businesses which John, if you want to give Dean.
John Humphrey: Yeah. So we have a number of projects there underway in Virginia as well as in Florida. I don’t really think of them as poll-ins. It’s just that the revenue was recognized in the second quarter. We probably would have expected a little bit at the end of the third quarter. It wasn’t anything we tried to do but just because of the effectiveness of completing and getting milestones on those projects with a little more revenue to what we would have expected for the second quarter.
Deane Dray - Citi Research: Would that be reflected in lower third quarter or the TransCore business or would we not see that blip?
John Humphrey: No, there is probably not as much growth as what we would have thought three months ago. So we had a little more in second quarter, may be a little less than the third quarter but still for the year, we can -- we continue to see our total traffic business performing extremely well with a very nice growth.
Deane Dray - Citi Research: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Hi. Good morning.
Brian Jellison: Hi. Good morning, Steve.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Just on the guidance, when you tweaked up the organic growth rate for the year up to the high end and you barely budge the EPS number with your conversion rates being extremely strong at 50% or so. I would have expected maybe at least a nickel or dime with the additional revenue. I don’t think there is a change in tax rate. There is something on mix and margin, that’s going to change here in the second half?
Brian Jellison: I wouldn’t say so. I mean, what it is, is that our range of particular outcomes on the organic roadside, and we just continue to move towards the higher end of that range because the performance that we’ve been able to post in both the first and the second quarter. So we’ve been mostly done in the second quarter that won’t we expected, but the second half still looks very consistent with kind of what we’ve seen throughout the year. So we wouldn’t read too much into that.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay. And then I guess just on the same kind of lot of question here third quarter, I mean I think it’s been a while since your earnings were -- didn’t grow nicely from the second to third quarter, just kind of from season perspective yet. You’re kind of guiding something, that’s more flattish to even maybe down a little bit again. Is there something -- is there a specific couple of businesses? Or on the margin front but that we should be looking at to justify that?
Brian Jellison: Our test business is expected to be higher, so our taxes are expected to be higher in the third quarter than the one…
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Right. Okay. So it’s just the tax dynamic, I think sales as well though. I mean, your sales are guided to be flat as well, flattish.
John Humphrey: I think on a sequential basis, sales will be a little higher than they were in the second quarter, but not dramatically higher in the second quarter. And part of that is, what we’re saying where you’ve got some revenue recognition in the second quarter around the TransCore project so that it does in fact taken away from the third quarter when that would be there. So we look at two quarters together, our guidance is kind of about where it would have been for, although just we raised the bottom in quite a bit because it’s already in the back.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Right. Okay. That makes sense. And just one last quick on the acquisition front, I would say this is kind of the material change in what you’re saying versus what you’re saying several months ago when you really were talking about the pricing environment being very tough. And then you talked about the size of the deals, some smaller ones closing near term, larger ones next year. Why -- is it just takes a longer, the large ones longer to get done, or is that just something about how the way the M&A environment kind of unfold in cycles, where the smaller ones go first and then the larger ones? I don’t know I’m just kind of curious as to why the difference in comments around the size of the deals.
Brian Jellison: I don’t think that there is any seasonality related to the size. There is a desire for lot of people if there is a market with asset they want to get it done generally before the end of the year for lots of reasons. So there is an opportunity to close more towards the end of the year. If you look at our history over time, you see a lot of the things that happen in the last quarter of the year. In terms of the size of deals, I mean, most of the things that we’ve been looking at this year are relatively large, but we have so many more smaller things that we can tucked in to an MHA and to a Sunquest that we’ve been willing to look at those things, which frankly we would have not paid a lot of energy to that, because we would have thought that we didn’t need another $100 million business here and another $80 million business here unless we had a leadership team that can assimilate those in a very good way. So we are encouraged by that and we’ve added an awful lot of strength to those two businesses in terms of people and leadership and capability. So that probably is as much of reason why I sound the way I do about that because of our confidence in the leadership in those companies. And then at the beginning of the year there were -- there certainly were large deals that we were interested in that we thought we’re going at high-teens multiples from an adjusted EBITDA basis that our diligence wasn’t willing to buy into the adjustments. So I think there is a little bit more clarity on the part of people about what they think they are going to do for the balance of this year and what they are going to do for the balance of next year, and diligence process is coming in with the more realistic outcome than guys trying to tell you this trees are going to the moon and they are not. They are a little more realistic. And we said for long time that things like junk bonds and CCC debt and subordinated. This crazy, crazy, crazy risk factors relative to where they trade on the pricing and start to see some erosion in that finally. So that changes attitudes instantly.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Right. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: We will take our next question from Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Brian Jellison: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs: So the first question I guess just talking about M&A, it does sound pretty encouraging how optimistic you are about getting the deals done. I guess, is there way you can quantify over the next 12 months how much you can get done? And clearly your balance sheet is in great shape. It seems like the pipeline is strong. And the follow-on beyond that is the focus has really been on the medical and scientific imaging, is that squarely where you are looking at today? Or are there areas across the rest of your portfolio where you are looking at due diligence as well?
Brian Jellison: Well, we look at a lot of different areas, but the reality is that the economic performance and cash on cash returns in medical and software just blow away the stuff that is generally available in energy or in any kind of core industrial business. So we’ve enjoyed great growth in our pump businesses, record level growth, but they take a lot of assets. So they don’t provide same level of cash on cash return that our software businesses do or that our medical businesses do. So we look at a lot of stuff, but the stuff that tends to get through the filter, we -- our overall company has a cash return on it, gross investment of over 100%. If you look at probably the single best multi industry guide that companies in the 40s, so we see a lot of incoming stuff, but generally if they are going to have cash returns in the 20s, they are not going to join our family. So it’s just the dynamic of the economic performance of the businesses that keeps us so active in the medical and software. And if you look at the next several quarters, over the next two years we view what expect we would -- we set for long time, we deploy $5 billion over the next four or five years, we would expect to deploy at least $1 billion to $1.5 billion every year, but it’s always lumpy about when that will happen. So I think that there are few things that we will probably do relatively quickly, and then there will be other things that we will reach in over time whether that happens in the next six months or the next 12 months is impossible to predict. And whether you do something for $100 million or you do something for a $1 billion on the timeline at which comes next is also impossible to predict because we will have offers to acquire things in which we are doing diligence, some which will be at a $100 million and others will be at a $1 billion. So we’re never in control of that dynamic.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs: That’s helpful color, Brian. And my follow-on question is around the drop to margins, clearly the incrementals were really strong this quarter at 46%. I think last quarter we were talking about an incremental range of 35%, 40%. So my question was, was there anything specific about the quarter that helped use the margin this quarter and how should we then think about your incremental margins moving forward. Is 35%, 40% the appropriate way to think about it or your business is really just kind of operating on all cylinders and maybe a higher range is appropriate at this time?
Brian Jellison: No, I think we think 35%, 40% is appropriate guidance for people over time. We’re always going to have mix variance second quarter on our company. It gets a lot of renewals in the software business, gets a lot of things happen in Q2. Q3 is really not as active Q4, then it gets to be really big, because all kinds of year end MRO and investments occur in the first quarter. I think our leverage was something like 37% and that was outstanding. This was extraordinary. And if it happens again, we will take it.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs: And just one follow-on question I guess on the margins for industrial tech. This is a margin that you call about a few things in the quarter. The operating margins have been down now for I think six quarters in a row on a year-over-year basis and things that it sounds like they are getting better at Cornell pump. Should we start to see margin expansion in this business moving forward?
Brian Jellison: I always react to that because I believe that the operating margins in the business are pretty close to the gross margin of everybody that they compete with. So thinking about the 29.5% operating margins in that business and wondering if they could get better, seems to me to be unrealistic, but we could deliver, you never know. These are the best industrial businesses known to anyone, I’m aware of. If you got anybody that’s got margins that look like these, please send us.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs: All right. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: And our next question from Chris Glynn, Oppenheimer.
John Humphrey: Hello.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: A very nice year-over-year expansion. Just wondering how to think about the dynamic there of mix versus core incremental margins? Clearly volume helped, but we talked about mix a lot with this business in the past.
John Humphrey: I’m sorry Chris. The first part of your question we didn’t catch, so which particular segment are you referring to?
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Yeah. John, this is RF and historically as the margins have moved, mix has been a big part of the discussion. So I’m just wondering if there is a way to think about core volume leverage since you did have good volumes and the margins were up nicely.
John Humphrey: Yeah. They’re really not a good way to think about that because of the vast difference in the underlying margin structure across this segment. The software business is the incrementals, they are coming much higher, particularly for their software renewals and the expansion. Their software, if it’s installations, it’s lower, of course, on the toll and traffic side, you also have the similar dynamic in terms of whether it’s tags and readers, which because of the technology and the investment, they make they carry higher gross margins versus the service and ongoing work. So I would love to give you the rule of thumb, but I just don’t have one, so based upon the relative contribution of our toll and traffic project business versus the technology that delivered through hardware or software.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Right. Yeah. Just struck me with toll and traffic leading to growth and then near record margins, but understood there is mix within that as well.
John Humphrey: And if I just follow up on that, it was especially strong in terms of the delivery of hardware and tags, our Amtech business, which is part of toll and traffic just had a phenomenal quarter, particularly with the continuing tag upgrade project in Florida.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay. And then we got some good color on the long run expectations for MHA and Sunquest. Verathon has got some things going on. Was wondering if we could get a similar commentary on Verathon Northern digital type businesses?
John Humphrey: So hope those have very good tailwind but for different reasons. So in terms of Northern Digital and the technology that they enable for image-guided surgery, so they have just a preeminent position inside image-guided surgery for what they are able to accomplish and that’s just the continuing growth in that market and because of their dominant share, they continue to benefit from that. Verathon on the other hand is really more of introduction of new and enhanced products when going through what is just a world class sales organization. And so therefore for different reasons, we expect both of those businesses to continue to have high-single-digit growth going forward for quite a long time I think.
Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.
John Humphrey: Hey, good morning.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research: Good morning. Two questions, Brian, we heard you complain about your tax rate through years actually and here is the discussion about M&A and the focus on healthcare and probably one of my question is going. I mean, is there a way to do something a little bit more creative with the corporate structure, the tax structure of the company?
Brian Jellison: The answer could be that there a lot of different things. As the topic (indiscernible) specifically today with a few other people, of course, are more and more inversions with the portion of the company or something. We’ve had a bright path to the door from people try to tell us about this, that and the other. Usually, they’re talking of businesses that are really pathetic and so the concept of doing something purely for taxes is not something we’re going to do. It needs to be a solid business. It is hard for people to find businesses like ours. It’s pretty unique to find a molding industry player, that’s got 59% gross margins and 33% EBITDA margins and has more than 20% cash to sales and find a partner with it. So we were still blessed with massive cash performance. And so as interest cost goes up for other people that are doing acquisitions, prices come down and we’re the biggest beneficiary that’s because we self fund most of everything we do and if we went out far in a billion or two and at the moment it is pretty modest. So we’re in a very, very good position, probably the best we’ve ever been in to do transactions. And if something came along that was a partial inversion with one of the businesses we wouldn’t necessarily rejected, but putting one of our great businesses with something that’s not very exciting because you might be able to save some tax in an environment that’s pretty ambiguous, is not a good strategy in our view. What we’ve said and we always say is there are to be a much better concept around corporate tax rates. And we’re having to pay a tax rate like ours when we compete in the global market is tough, but a lot of our businesses, even though 40% of the revenue is not in the United States. A lot of the best performing cash generated businesses are in the U.S. and it’s a little harder to do something with that and meet the inversion requirements that the government has. Let alone the risk of retroactivity from the March number that you’re seeing politicians trying to bring there.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research: Right. And then as follow-up actually on cash flow, so you have the cash tax noise in the quarter, we know it’s year-to-date, I mean, your cash taxes may have been $30 million or so, about what kind of went through on a GAAP P&L. So not a huge GAAP there. With the structural amortization benefit you have, I would have thought cash would have been a little bit better year-to-date. Is there anything else going on working capital and the comment about closing the year strong, should we expect something kind of in the 130% kind of zip code for the cash conversion rate for the year?
Brian Jellison: Yeah. I think the least that could -- we were expected to probably do a little bit better than 130%.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: Yeah. Good morning.
John Humphrey: Hey, good morning, Alex.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: Puts you on a new….
John Humphrey: Hello.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: Hello, hello.
John Humphrey: Hello.
Operator: Mr. Blanton, please go ahead.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: Hello, I got cut out. Hello.
John Humphrey: You’re still -- Alex you’re still on. We can hear okay.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: Okay. I didn’t know whether I was on it, sorry. I want to go into a little more along the line that someone was talking about the decline in earnings from second quarter. As to the reasons, I see the tax rate was 30.4% in the second quarter and that increased to 32%, it will cost you $0.04, but you’ve mentioned headwinds in TransCore and I don’t think, I heard anything more about that. And also are there any acquisition expenses connected with FoodLink?
John Humphrey: So, any acquisition expenses that we have, were recorded in the second quarter, since we did close on that transaction on July 2. So I wouldn’t say that that’s material but we do expect to have some acquisition expenses in the third quarter, not related to FoodLink. On the other hand you did obviously pickup on the tax rate increase in Q2 to Q3 and we just had a very strong conversion as Brian mentioned for the second quarter. Some of the software renewal did happen during that timeframe, carry along with them very high margins. So we continue to see the second half, somewhere in 35% to 40% leverage on incremental growth and then so it’s very similar to what we have in the first half.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: And what were the headwinds in TransCore that Brian referred to when he was talking about that segment but didn’t go into any detail on it?
John Humphrey: So really headwinds as much is timing associated with the milestones on a project. So as we mentioned, we had very strong performance for executing on those projects in Virginia and Texas and in Florida and other places and that comes along with some revenue recognitions, profit recognitions in the second quarter. That looks a little bit better than what we would have expected for the third quarter.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: Okay. Thank you.
John Humphrey:  You’re welcome Alex.
Operator: That will end our question-and-answer session for today’s call. I’ll turn the call back over to John Humphrey for closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Tina and thank you all for joining us this morning. And we look forward to talking to you at the end of our third quarter.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: The Roper Industries' First Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. All participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's conference is being record. I will now turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
John Humphrey: Thank you and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our first quarter. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, who heads our Planning and Investor Relations for us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website at www.roperind.com. Next slide. So we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed on our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. Now if you'll please turn to Slide 3, today we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter primarily on a GAAP basis. Prior period results are presented on an adjusted basis for comparison purposes. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation, which is available on our website. Now if you'll please turn to slide, I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. So we'll go through the first quarter enterprise financial results first and then we'll take a look at the detail around each of our four segments and the outlook for those four segments for the second quarter and the full year as a total, and then what our Q2 guidance is. As you know, we're raising our guidance here for the full year. And then have a Q&A session. So next slide. Here we'll look at the summary of the enterprise financial results. We had once again all-time records for orders and backlog. And revenue, net earnings, EBITDA, cash flow, everything at an all-time record level, really terrific quarter. Revenue was up 13% with organic revenue up 7% and the book-to-bill was above 1 at 1.01. If you look at GAAP to non-GAAP numbers, they actually came at about the same at 13% revenue up. Gross margin was up 120 basis points to 58.6%. I hope you're shocked to see our gross margin. And there's some reversion to a mean of those industrial companies that people look at. But we're not really an industrial company anymore and our 58.6% gross margin is in fact up 120 basis points. If you looked at GAAP to GAAP, it would have been up 140 basis points. Our EBITDA was up 19% to $274 million and our EBITDA margin was up 180 basis points to 32.8%. If you looked at GAAP to GAAP, it would have been up 21%. Our earnings before tax, which is a really important number this time around, are up 24% to $205 million. You may remember that a lot of people, ourselves included, in the first quarter of 2013 benefited from the expenders in the tax program and double-dip benefit on R&D tax credits and they'll benefit yet this year. And we had a discrete item this quarter that benefited us by $0.06 despite the headwind that we had. Our operating cash flow was also up 24%. So the operating cash flow and the earnings before tax were virtually identical. Free cash flow was up 26% to $202 million. So it's a great start for the year. Next slide. Here if we look at the income statement, you can see orders came in at $846 million, giving us a book-to-bill of 1.01 against the revenue of $834 million. I will talk about growth here in just a minute. The gross margin, as we said, was up 120 basis points. Operating income increased by 18.3%. On a GAAP to GAAP basis, it was over 20%. Operating margin was at 26.8%, up 130 basis points. And the earnings before tax number was up 24%. As we said, the tax rate, you can see the difference here. Last year was 23.1%. This year, it's 28.2%. So that's 510 basis point headwind into the quarter compared to last year, but that was an unrealistic expectation. And in fact, our 28.2% was a little bit better on the tax side than our guidance had anticipated. If you do look at 28.2% in common size over the first quarter of last year, our earnings would have been $1.18, not $1.27. And we compare that with $1.46, we're up 23%. Next slide. On the EBITDA growth and margin expansion, our long-term sustainable trends continued. You see our trailing 12 months EBITDA is now at $1.118 billion. That's up 35% in the last two years from $830 million. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA margin is now at 33.2%, up 320 basis points from just two years ago. And if you really want to see the power of our Roper business model and how the CRI tools work, all you have to do is go back to 2010 with our year-end EBITDA was at 26.7% compared to our closing year-end EBITDA this past year in 2013 of 32.8%. And you see 610 basis points of improvement. And compare that to the S&P 500 on gross margins, which are around 28% in those periods. Next slide. If you look at our cash flow results, you see once again terrific results accelerating activity. We had $213 million in operating cash flow in the quarter, which was over 25% of sales. Cash conversion was 144%. And on a free cash flow basis, we generated $202 million of free cash flow and conversion was 137%. We earned $1.46 on a diluted basis, but if you look at that conversion of 137%, you can do the math and see what the free cash flow per share was. That's really a direct result of how great each of these individual businesses that we have really are and their ability to deploy our CRI tools and discipline to create these sustainable cash flows. As a percent of revenue, you can see free cash flow for the last 12 months has now been 24% of revenue. We said in this year's annual report and repeated here in the takeaway that we believe cash is the best measure of performance. And I guess we're maybe as timely just put that on everyone of our slides that we believe cash is the measure of performance. Next slide. Asset-light business model, well, just to demonstrate, even when you get these very low levels, there's room for improvement. If you look at the first quarter in 2012, our inventory was running 7.5% of sales. And here we are two years later at 6.3% of sales. Receivables have gone from 16.9% to 18.2%. That's actually favorable, because unbilled receivables are in that number. And that's why we look at the deferred revenue aspect of things. Payables and accruals are at 18.2%. So they're up nicely, giving us the inventory plus receivables minus payables on accruals line there at 6.3% of revenue, down 320 basis points from just two years ago. So for those people who think we can't continue to improve, we just want to demonstrate that the processes we have do create really unusual values. Next slide. Strong financial position, I think our press release indicates it's best in our history from a balance sheet viewpoint. Last May, we acquired MHA for $1 billion. So we've been able to self-fund virtually that entire $1 billion acquisition during the course of the year. You can see our cash is now up to $503 million and an undrawn revolver of $1.4 billion. So we have $1.9 billion of immediate liquidity here. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is up from $950 million $1.118 billion. So the gross debt number EBITDA is about 2.1 versus 2.0 a year ago. After investing $1.07 billion last year, we would say that we would expect to do the same thing during the next 12 months, probably even a greater amount of investment here in capital deployment. Next slide. We'll move here into the segment detail and look at each of the individual businesses. So next slide, we'll start with an overview of how widespread the growth was here in the quarter. On the left-hand side of this chart, you can see the organic growth by segment. Energy was up 5% and Medical & Imaging up 7%, RF up 8%, Industrial Technology up 9%. Industrial Technology is primarily Neptune, including handling. About a quarter of Industrial Technology is actually industrial businesses that are instrumentation businesses. All the rest are really water, including handling. In the RF segment, which was up 8%, that's really the toll business, our SaaS software businesses, are CBORD and Horizon legacy software businesses and then just a modest amount of products. Medical & Imaging is really split between the medical IT business, which is the largest amount, the medical products business and some scientific instrumentation, a little bit of cameras. And in Energy, that 5% growth comes from about two-thirds of segment is energy related and one-third of that segment is really industrial related. If you look on the right-hand side and you see the revenue by region, we actually had favorable organic revenue in every region in the world. The US, which is about 61% of revenue, in Canada which is about 6% of revenue came in at up 7%. And then Europe, which includes Russia by the way, which is up 6% with Russia being a modest portion of the $125 million in revenue in Europe. Asia was up 9% with Japan and China being those two biggest areas. And the rest of the world was up 7%. We report the Middle East and Africa in the rest of the world, which is a big portion of that total revenue. Next slide. By the way, currency, I should just mention currency currently is like 20 basis points. It was pretty much all in Canada, where it depressed our organic revenue. But as an enterprise, it was only at 20 bps negative. So pretty much a neutral. Next slide, we'll look first here at the Energy Systems & Controls segment. That generated $37 million in operating profit on $155 million of revenue, which is almost 24% OP margin. The organic growth was up 5% that was led by our compressor controls continued to grow in Asia and in the Middle East. We had very solid sales of new instruments for our refinery operations, which sometimes can be pretty cyclical. The Zetec performance improved, so it wasn't as big a drag on the business and we'll talk about that in a minute getting much better throughout the year. And then our Advanced Sensors acquisition, which came in right at the end of last year, which was $50 million investment in offshore technology, is very interesting technology. The integration process is underway there and it will take through the second half before we turn that business into a more profitable entity. So it was a bit of a drag on margins in the first quarter. In the second quarter and throughout the year, we expect the oil and gas portions of our Energy segment to be up high single-digits, 8%, 9%, led mostly by the liquid natural gas pipeline activity and the field services associated with the things we do there. The Zetec outlook is much more encouraging. It'll support second half organic growth. It was a drag last year in the second half. And the segment in total will be on target for record performance in 2014. And just as a reminder, that segment, which is about 15% of the operating profit of the company, it's divided sort of two-thirds to energy and one-third to industrial. Next slide is our Industrial Technology segment. Here we reported $56 million of operating profit on $197 million in revenue. Industrial Technology is about 23% of the operating profit of the enterprise. We had double-digit growth in Neptune and continued margin expansion at Neptune. There's comments from certain competitors that are inconsistent with that, but we're right, they're wrong. Higher material analysis revenues at Struers for both equipment and consumables, the equipment is a big deal, because Struers has been living on consumable growth for a while and equipment revenues have been sharply around the world. So that really bodes well for the rest of the year at Struers. And our Roper Pumps' Houston facility was opened. In fact, all of our senior leaders toured that facility in the first quarter. It's a very impressing operation. A lot of customers have been through now, saying it's the best-in-class operation of its site anywhere in the world. And we expect that to start to manifest itself in double-digit growth here in the rest of the year, which will improve our margins. That startup costs are what brought down the margin in the first quarter by a modest amount, but that will easily be past us. In Cornell, which continues to perform remarkably well, had a big quarter with rental markets, all of which we think probably bodes well for the energy side of the activity we have in industrial. We look at the second half of the year. We're seeing Roper Pumps' capacity increase will drive share gains against particular competitors. It will lead to double-digit growth for us at Roper Pumps and it'll improve our margins in that business, which were already quite sizeable. Neptune strength we expect to continue. So we get reasonable numbers on new housing starts and continued build-outs and replacement of old meters and continued deployment in Canada and other systems that we've won. We see modest global industrial production continuing to be up, which helps drive our material analysis business. And on balance, just continued growth throughout the sector, strong margins and cash performance throughout the year. Next slide. Here we look at the Radio Frequency technology segment. This delivered about $63 million in operating profit on $226 million in revenue. So the revenue, all organic, was up 8%. The toll and traffic business remained very strong, had double-digit growth in the quarter, primarily in three areas, our Florida all-electronic tolling conversion projects, Texas expansion and upgrades to the technology, and higher tag shipments in Florida, Texas and California. CBORD performed particularly well in the quarter as its recurring revenue was up nicely from some of these project installs we've had over the last several years in a terrific confirmation for continuing license agreements and maintenance with people. And then we had the modest growth we traditionally see out of our SaaS businesses, which had really amazing, an exceptional leverage and cash flow contribution that helps us reinvest to drive our overall growth in the entity. In the remainder of the year, we think Transcore's backlog will support its continued growth. Project work is continuing as expected throughout the balance of the year from anything we can see. And our quotation activity around the world on projects remains very strong and that's encouraging. In the software businesses, they're continuing to grow with exceptional margins and we're really starting to see end user increase drive activity. Many times in these businesses, it becomes the early adopters or people who really need to have technological advantage in competing. And now the followers are jumping on the bandwagon, demanding some access to open solutions and being the best provider for those, where our demand and quotations are up at best levels ever. Our college and university hosting activities have been increasing normally. In the past, they were more reluctant to do hosting than there have been recently and that may be a positive long-term uptick for us. Next slide. Here we look at the Medical & Scientific Imaging business. It really is a medical business. Imaging is kind of split in two pieces, out scientific business with Gatan and then the camera businesses. Those things together are less than 25% of the segment. So medical is 75% and it's split between medical IP businesses and the medical product businesses. Organic revenue was up 7% in the quarter. So we had double-digit revenue growth at Sunquest as our implementation improvements have really taken hold. We have more people deployed and we have faster turnarounds on them. MHA continued to benefit from favorable end-markets. The trends and the share gains that they have are driving growth certainly ahead of plan. We've got solid execution growth across all of our medical device platforms with just extraordinary performance from Northern Digital in the first quarter of the year, more than double-digit growth there. Our imaging businesses were better, led by growth in Gatan, so that eased the drag that that has had on our segment in the past and we expect that to continue for the rest of the year. But we also expect double-digit growth out of Sunquest. We've record backlog at the moment. And we got a terrific sales funnel. That organization continues to mature and deploy resources effectively. So it's going to have really quite exceptional year in 2014. MHA continues as expected. We think the momentum and everything around its core businesses are solid. We have new and enhanced products at Verathon, which are kind of game changing. The early acceptors of that, as we've been showing, is high. And we expect that will drive revenue throughout the rest of this year. And then we think the imaging businesses for the first time in a long time will have some modest growth that will make the overall segment look better. Gross margins in that segment are very, very high and the EBITDA margins for this segment came in at this time at 43.9%. Next slide. So here as we look at the guidance outlook for the business as a whole, next slide gets into the detail. We're raising the guidance from what it had been $6.05 to $6.25 for the year to $6.22 to $6.36 on the year. It's a $0.14 increase at midpoint. Our full year tax rate we still expect to be about 31%. It was a little lower, 28% in the first quarter and likely to be closer to 31% in Q2 and unfortunately a little bit higher in the balance of the year. We also think our organic revenue certainly at the bottom will be higher than expected. So we've raised our guidance there from 4% to 7% to 5% to 7%. And established Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.46 to $1.51. But as always, we would tell you that that's an interesting number, but you should follow the cash. Next slide. If you look at our first quarter, we gad record results in just about every category that you can find. Revenue again was up 13%. Our gross margin was up 120 basis points and operating margin up 130 basis points. EBITDA appeared a run rate far in excess of $1 billion a year. EBITDA margin at 32.8% compared to the S&P 500 industrial gross margins of 28%, which tells you something about how great the businesses we have on our portfolio are. Our operating cash flow was up 24% to $213 million. And the operating cash flow conversion rate, we said before, was 144%. Free cash flow conversion at 137% on $202 million divided by the shares get you really a spectacular number. And even our net earnings are up to 171.7% of revenue, which is far and away best-in-class. Excellent start to the year. We've raised the guidance. We think the full year will be pretty spectacular as well. And with that, we'd like to open it up for Q&A.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We'll have our first question from Deane Dray, Citi Research.
Deane Dray - Citi Research: Solid operating performance across the board whether you look at topline, incrementals or cash. On the look-forward, Brian, you mentioned the $1.7 billion was what you've invested in the last 12 months. You can do that or better in the next 12 months. Maybe some color on the pipeline and maybe address the challenges of how you positioned against private equity bidders.
Brian Jellison: So It was $1.07 billion, not $1.70 billion. So we did $1 billion-and-change and $50 million-and-change for Advanced Sensors. So we did $1 billion deal in total, $1.07 billion. We'd expect to do at least that much over the next 12 months. In terms of what's going on with private equity, basically the debt staples from the banks remain extraordinarily high frequently. There are seven times debt to EBITDA, almost always some number close to that. And their ability to refinance is exceptionally high. So that puts a lot of pressure around prices paid for assets. We've said for a while that gross premium on the tails of those kind of assets are pretty risky, but they're pretty low cost. So those guys are going to continue to stand in rapid rate, paying a lot of money for the things that they're doing. The kind of businesses that we acquire from (inaudible) aren't really expected by that so much, because when they're exiting particular investment cycle and and sell the business any way, if the business fits in our categories and meets our standards and the management team, it is something that we think works with us, we still have the competitive advantage of being able to deploy capital to buy those assets. So we actually are seeing as much now as we ever have seen in terms of attractive and available things. We don't have a timetable for when our next capital deployment would be, but we're active on a lot of different things. And I'm sure within next 12 months, you'd find us deploying more capital than we did in the prior year.
Deane Dray - Citi Research: And then just on the businesses, I know there's lots of attention about the addition of Sunquest and MHA, but the legacy Software as a Service business, CBORD, maybe you can clarify the point on hosting. So I understand access control. I understand the driving haul. I understand the credit card. But maybe you can expand on the term of hosting activity.
Brian Jellison: What CBORD is at the core a license software company with maintenance and annual fees and revenues and renewals of what we have, because of some of the other things we've done and the ability to convert many more people to a hosted service just like a typical SaaS business would be that we have in an iTrade operation or (inaudible). We continue to look at acquisitions that are in those spaces. And we think some of the budget pressure around college and universities is getting them to find it easier to do some of the work that we do for them in the cloud, where they haven't done much. And we're offering them solutions that they find easy to migrate to. So we have been encouraged by people asking us if we could do more in that arena. Switching is those businesses, it's got a really high switching cost. So it gives us a leg up relative to other people who're trying to enter that market.
Deane Dray - Citi Research: And just to clarify, what percent of that CBORD base today is on a hosted basis and what are the economics?
Brian Jellison: It's still a pretty little number. It's less than 5% of their base primarily in one of their applications called NetMenu, which is really around menu planning and nutritional information and being able to kind of be the front end of starting that food supply chain through those campus locations. And as far as the economics are concerned, I mean economics are really good for CBORD whether you're going with the traditional license plus ongoing maintenance for a more SaaS-based. There's really no different than the customer acquisition cost. And so it's probably a little bit higher, but a little bit load upfront. But largely the economics are going to look very similar to the underlying economics for the CBORD business.
Operator: And our next question will come from Mark Douglas, Longbow Research.
Mark Douglas - Longbow Research: Looking at your guidance on the organic growth, 1Q was the easiest comp and your guidance implies organic growth and continue to maintain this close to the 7% level, your comps are getting more challenged in the second half. Just dive a little bit more into what's giving the confidence in the second half, do you think that'd be that strong, do you some things in the backlog?
Brian Jellison: Sure. First of all, I know what the numbers say, but I'm not sure I would agree with the easy comp in Q1, only because Q1 last year was when we had the biggest variance associated with that loss customer (inaudible). It was not like it was artificially depressed. It just got the run rate as of last year. And we did build some momentum throughout the year. So in some cases, you're correct. But based upon yet another quarter where the book-to-bill is above 1, so we did build some backlog even with the tremendous 7% organic growth in the first quarter. It gives us the confidence. We have continued visibility, pretty good visibility within our toll and traffic area, parts of our energy in the market we have pretty good visibility on. And it's just continued momentum on execution, particularly on medical platform where we not only have the backlog associated with Sunquest and deploying new upgrades to their software customers, but also a couple of new products that are being introduced in our medical products area that we think is going to drive incremental growth there also. So it's the totality of backlog plus ongoing momentum inside of our key end markets.
Mark Douglas - Longbow Research: Talking about the pumps market, curious what's happening in the underlying market. Are you looking at low single-digit growth, mid single, just trying to get a sense of how much of your double-digit growth is new product launch, an increased capacity versus just a product mix maybe outgrowing the market or seems like you're outgrowing the market?
Brian Jellison: Well, I think that we have three discrete pump businesses, each of the three should have a record year this year, each one for different reason. So we have Allweiler pumps in Germany, which is we don't talk a lot about, that has strong demand drivers in India. And it's kind slurry pumps and things that have to do with moving anything from a mining [ph] capacity or whatever. That business is up a little bit. Then we have our double-digit reference that we made to Roper Pumps where we've been capacity constrained in larger diameter directional drilling, things and that's what this factory solved. So as that comes, will this be taking share from other applications without naming customers would large cables, so that's kind of a guaranteed upside to us. And the underlying core business is okay as well, probably more high single-digit growth in that Roper Pumps business. And then Cornell has fluctuations around rental markets when people are looking to waste water markets and putting together platforms and if you get a little bit more activity of background fracking in gas and they are benefited by that. And it's got a big business in agricultural irrigation projects. It's pretty much a domestic business, a little bit in the Middle East. So it's growing. But I think there've been some people that are in similar spaces to Cornell. We've had pretty decent growth in the first quarter as well.
Operator: We have our next question from Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research: Just a couple of questions. Brian, just wondering on medical margins. This is kind of two quarters in a row kind of in the 35% ballpark, extraordinarily strong. I was wondering if there's something mixed effects of something that causes the step-up to this level, or is this kind of normalized run rate we should think about going forward?
Brian Jellison: Well, if you look at those gross profit margins in those businesses and our ability to execute, that probably would answer that question. It is not going to have a lot of difficulty maintaining and improving its margins. The business is well over 75% healthcare IT and medical products now as opposed to being one very strong business like Gatan and scientific instruments and the camera businesses, which have high gross margins but have high R&D expenses, usually double-digit R&D as a function of sales for those businesses because of high price cycles. So yeah, we would expect to have very, very solid margins in the healthcare IT businesses like Sunquest and MHA.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research: And then just coming back around the deals, I mean what you said earlier to Deane's question pretty straightforward, but you do sound more confident. Just kind of reading some of the transcripts from the (inaudible) and everything, it sounds like you're viewing things as much more difficult maybe to get done. What else has changed? Is the complexion of what's available out of private equity changing or is there some other dynamic that raises your confidence level a little bit?
Brian Jellison: I wouldn't say that. I think that we've come close to doing a couple of larger transactions in the first part of the year that for a variety of reasons didn't occur. But yet, we're always involved in things that look pretty attractive and we're aware of things that are happening later on this year that are attractive. There are different reasons why private equity is selling assets. And it's the end of life of a fund and they've got to sell as opposed to recap, they've gone through an unusual period where the cost of debt is so low and the risks and the mezzanine pieces are so mispriced that it's easy for them to recap stuff. But they can't recap that forever. They got to cut the core and if they need the management team to stay in place, then there're only a few people around, Oh, my gosh, that are in the business of acquiring great management teams and making it better. And so that's why we're confident that we're always able to execute and capital deployment. It's just we don't have a budgeted timeframe for saying, let's do $250 million a quarter or we're going to say, no, let's do $1 billion, $1.5 billion or more a year.
Operator: We'll go next to Matt Summerville, KeyBanc.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc: Just a couple of questions, first on Neptune. That business is up double-digits again. Brian or John, how much of that would you say is market-related versus market share and why or why not should we expect that to continue?
John Humphrey: Inside the quarter, I'm not sure I can make the split between market versus market share. And we continue to execute in Canada for a large Toronto project at a pretty healthy rate. So that's helpful. We generally take a little bit wider lens on the market share question. And I would not say that that has substantially changed. So I suspect most of this is going to be market-driven, but quarter-to-quarter based upon how projects are rolling out new rollouts of fixed network or mobile network implementation of the various cities, we'll move that a little bit. But we're still in the high-30% share range for Neptune. And there's one of the things that we like about that are switching costs are pretty high. We have a pretty good representation in those areas that are probably disproportionately affected by new housing starts. So that probably over time gives us a little bit of tailwind.
Brian Jellison: If you have new housing starts that are on the uptick as opposed to where they were for a couple of years, we're likely to have a disproportionate share of that because of where new housing starts are. So we have a higher share in places that require water meters because of our technology being dramatically superior to other people's performance. So if you have a hard out location and you're building in the Southeast or Southwest, we're going to have higher than our national share. So we just automatically gain at the expense of others as new housing starts are on the uptick.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc: And then just lastly with respect to Verathon, can you provide a little more granularity into some of the new products you're launching there and then just maybe a brief update on what you're seeing in your Dynisco business?
John Humphrey: Sure, I'll take the second one first. I mean Dynisco is doing just fine. It's a more industrial-focused areas, as Brian was talking about inside our energy segment. It was up in a low single-digit range in the first quarter. Pretty good operating performance margins, was up a little bit. With respect to Verathon, what they're doing is really a refresh of a couple of their product lines, coming out with a titanium GlideScope. So it removes some of the plastic. It actually makes it slightly smaller for the intubation insertion, which is a big deal for the doctors and a big deal for the emergency responders. So that's small size difference is actually quite significant in terms of the success rate of being able to have a success for intubation. And then also a little bit later a redesigned BladderScan unit that has significantly higher reliability and performance and ease of use for the nurses. So it's really a refresh of the existing product lines, but with some real fundamental game changers, particularly on the GlideScope side.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: You actually had mentioned, I think, in mid-March, you guys were talking about some potential for weather-related disruptions, didn't seem to be the case, but maybe you could just expand on that, maybe you recouped all that in March or something like that, just kind of curious.
Brian Jellison: I think we certainly didn't expect a lot of trouble from the poor weather, but we had to run some over time, but it really worked itself out. We had a little bit more backlog at Neptune than we otherwise would have had, but there wasn't anything material about weather. It's not some big windfall would get from additional shipments in the second quarter, helped a little bit in that respect, but not much. And the costs that we had were immaterial.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: And then just moving to the businesses on the traditional kind of imaging side, it sounds like you guys are a little more positive on that. I think that was hit hard by the NIH budget last year. Any updates on that business?
Brian Jellison: Yeah, we did better in Japan and had a quite robust Q1 with Japan. But most of those businesses are really non-US businesses other than NIH here. They're okay. They will perform at the lowest level of incremental change or positive organic that we have in the company that may have decent fees relative to last year being a very good year. But you have to remember that more than 75% of that business is really all healthcare. Imaging is sort of split. So you got maybe 10% or so in cameras and 10% or so or a little more than that Gatan in completely different world-class business. The cameras are the ones that really are always waiting on maybe expanding out of Japan and something from China and NIH here. So those are the ones that have the cyclical risk, not the other half, which is Gatan.
Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: When I look out to next year, with the rate guidance now saying the Street number for next year, looks like it's, I don't know, like 5% to 7% EPS growth. There're been a lot that's moved around in your businesses and you had a couple of businesses fall off last year. Maybe there're some moving parts that I'm not accounting for, but is there something about the margins you guys are putting out, means your next year be an unusually weak margin year? I mean it seems like the organic growth is holding up in kind of the mid 5% to 7% range. So that kind of number would imply very limited margin improvement and obviously nobody is taking any kind of real incremental acquisition accretion. So is there anything kind of like unusual about the organic profile you guys put up this quarter and kind of this year that shouldn't kind of carry into the next year? The number seems very low, 5% to 7% EPS growth seems very low.
Brian Jellison: We never put any guidance around EPS growth for 2015. But we'd say we'd expect to do 1.5 to 2 times GDP, certainly have done a little bit better than that now and we might continue to do better for all of this year, could be all of the next year. I think there's a reasonable optimism at the part of our field people. We just maybe do things a little different than some people. We went through our planning process for this year in February. We don't do it in the fourth quarter, because our bonuses are an incremental change year-over-year, not planned performance. So we don't pay off budget plans. We'd be hard pressed to name a business that sees any fall off in 2015 from the planning cycle, but that's a long way away.
Operator: We'll go next to Christopher Glynn, Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Wanted to extend these questions there, if you comment for the revenues, 1.5 to 2 times GDP. Is there a sort of a 1.-something to put on EPS relative to topline growth over the cycle?
Brian Jellison: Look, what we have generally wanted to guide folks, the way to think about that incremental growth is given our margin profile, we would expect that next dollar of revenue to convert to the pre-tax line at somewhere between $0.30 and $0.40, maybe a little bit higher than that in some years, but not lower than that. And so I think if you run the math using that, and this is not really a time for us to be thinking much about 2015. The detailed discussions and strategic plan reviews that we have with our businesses to be able to have a much more informed view of 2015 and beyond, but that's much later in the year.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: And then on RF, I'm wondering if the linearity changed at all. You had anticipated heavy project breadth in the first half. Now it sounds like things may be spreading out a little bit more throughout the balance of the year.
Brian Jellison: We still expect RF to be strong in the first half than the second half. And we started some of these projects toward the second half of last year. But overall, of course with the balance of revenue coming from all of our segments, we still feel comfortable that the 5% to 7% for the full year is generally where all four of the segments will be, probably a little bit higher than that in medical. But the other three segments will be in that range of 5% to 7% for the full year.
Operator: We'll go next to Richard Eastman, Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Just a quick question. On the energy business, when I look in the quarter and I look at the order number, were there any timing issues there or were you comfortable with the orders in the quarter? Sequentially it looked like perhaps were there any weather impact or anything that maybe held those back a little bit in the quarter?
Brian Jellison: No, I don't think there is anything there. Energy's order flow is a little more like our (inaudible) CCC, which is a large player in it. It could be really lumpy. I mean they could get a $20 million order that didn't happen in Q1 and happens in Q2. And it doesn't mean anything. You have to look at that over a kind of 12 month trending period and a trend for them is certainly up.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: And then also in IT business, the margins are good, but maybe down a little bit year-over-year. And is that piece of the business, is that where you saw a little bit of weather impact on the margins, just curious how you looked at the margins there in the quarter.
Brian Jellison: Now, that's just Roper Pumps starting up Houston. You really have all the expense at the startup, but we take that period cost and just barely getting started on shipments. So that will write itself right away as we start to ship our product.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Brian, I noticed in the proxy that Roper has petitioned for a change in its gig code. And I'm curious it wasn't mentioned to what, but are we thinking medical technology, are we thinking software?
Brian Jellison: Our primary gig code is now our application software, medical and healthcare IT, medical products and there's some analytical instrumentation, I'm not sure what that gigs code is. But because we have a lot of diversity, the two places they obviously put us into financial, almost capital markets thing, which is where I think they finally just put (inaudible). But in our case, they didn't have to put us in a conglomerate category, so we'll be with Danaher and GE and United Technology and there's like almost six people in there. But unfortunately, they're quite large. I think Carlyle might be in there, I don't know. But that's what we would expect that we would go into the industrial conglomerates, I think it's called. And we would expect that to be announced by the end of the month, I think.
Brian Jellison: We'll just say to make sure from a proxy point, we were an electronic components or something. We don't have a single business in the gigs code to which we were assigned, not a single one.
Operator: Alex Blanton, Clear Harbor Asset Management.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: I wanted to ask you about what you said about the Roper Pumps facility in Houston, because that was your original business and that was originally acquired before you went public by (inaudible) 30 years ago and under continuous improvement, you're still improving it apparently. Could you tell us exactly why your customers are saying that that's a real class best-in-class facility in the world?
Brian Jellison: Because the situation is we got several products in Roper Pumps, some of which are OEM products and some which are now products for the fracking operations, where they're doing drilling. So one of the things that happened is one of the large people in the space acquired another company, Robbins & Myers. I think there are some customers who (inaudible) think they'd rather buy from maybe some other person like us. So we've been approached by people about could we do larger diameter products than we do in our Commerce, Georgia, facility, which is the founding operation of Roper back in the reference you have. And we've had difficulty doing these larger things, because you got to have a couple of cranes. You need some automation. Got to have special heat-treat situations we need to do. And we had our Alpha instruments business, which is part of Dynisco acquisition that's an instrument company that is a very knowledgeable about rubber and latex. And they came up with a way for us to have a substance that wraps the product that we're making here in a way that allows it to operate at faster speeds and in higher rates of temperature. So it's an entirely new technology for the industry. And that facility will be sole sourced on providing those larger diameter products in that arena. And as it comes online, it will gain share from people that have less effective products now. And then they get used quickly. They have a short life. And so they get realigned, so by moving to Texas, we're close to the market where people can ship back the drills that can get realigned and go back for second use applications.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: The second question is about what you said about the Russian business. What are you doing in Russia? And also, Asia was up 9%. What's the biggest contribution you're getting from Asia?
Brian Jellison: Well, in Asia, there's three areas of growth for us. I mean everything grows a little bit here. But you have Japan was up this past year on technological purchases. China was up modestly. And India was up sharply somewhat with our pump businesses actually and some instrumentation businesses. So those are the three bellwethers there. In Europe, we did $125 million of revenue in the second quarter and $5 million of that was Russia. So going back to your day, so you would remember with Gazprom being the single most important entity that affected Roper most of the '90s is an irrelevant factor today. So Russia was 4% of the European activity. And how that'll do over the balance of the year with whatever is going to happen politically will be interesting, but it's nothing it used to be where if you had a problem in Russia in Roper in 1995, the business was threat.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: So that seg is a little bit with Gazprom?
Brian Jellison: No, not necessarily. There are people who serve the install base. And so we have products that go into. We also have some products that still go into Russia. So it's just in the energy segment.
Operator: That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We will now return to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Thank you. And once again thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you at the end of our second quarter. Have a good day.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2013 Q4  (2014-01-27 08:00:00) =====
Executives:  Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer John Humphrey - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Rob Crisci – Director of Planning and Investor Relations Paul Soni – Vice President and Controller
Analysts:  Joseph Ritchie – Goldman Sachs Deane Dray – Citi Research Matt Summerville – KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. Stephen Tusa – JPMorgan Jeffrey Sprague – Vertical Research Partners Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. Mark Douglass – Longbow Research Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird 
Operator: The Roper Industries Fourth Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. I would now like turn the call over to Mr. John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Mary, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our fourth quarter. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, Director of Planning and Investor Relations. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com.  If you turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we’ll be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed on our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. Now if you'll please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our fourth quarter results on a GAAP basis. Results from prior periods are presented on an adjusted basis for comparison purposes, primarily related to revenue recognition around our Sunquest and MHA acquisitions. Reconciliations between this prior period GAAP and adjusted results are included in this presentation as attachments. Now if you'll please turn to the next slide, I’ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we’ll take questions from our participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. We start here with an overview. I’ll give you fourth quarter enterprise financial results discussion and then look at the segment detail that happened in the quarter and what the implications are for 2014 and then close out with Q1 guidance and the 2014 guidance for what’s going on. We have some facts headwinds in ’14. We’ll talk about them. You’ll find our guys a lot more robust as some early notes indicated. All right. So we have the Q4 results, next slide. If you look at enterprise financial results, we had a record across the board for any quarter in the history again. We achieved record orders, record backlog, record revenue, record net earnings, record EBITDA and the orders as we’ll talk about were really terrific. $900 million in orders, $889 million in revenue with a book-to-bill of 1.01. Gross margins hit 60% in that quarter. Wow, 60%, up 210 basis points. EBITDA was up 12% to $307 million in the quarter. Our EBITDA margin was up 80 bps to 34.5%. And an EBITBA margin of 34.5% really is another example of Roper’s transformation that’s occurred over the last several years. Our DEPS were up 11% to $1.65 in the quarter, above our guidance and our operating cash flow was up 11% to $236 million, getting dangerously close to $1 billion run rate there. We’re very well positioned as a result of this quarter for 2014. So it’s really a great momentum item for us as we move ahead. Next slide, on the fourth quarter income statement, here you can see orders were up 16%, 10% organic orders. Double digit organic growth is a phrase we haven’t heard for a long time. Revenue was up 9%, with organic at 4%. Gross profit was up 210 basis points from 57.9% to 60%. Our operating margin came up from 28.3% to 29% or 70 bps. Interest expense was about the same. Tax rate was a 10 bps headwind in the quarter, but not really material. And net earnings then came in at $166 million versus $147 million in the corresponding quarter, up 11%. Next slide, if we look at the EBITDA and margin expansion, I think we're going to point attention to the fact that just three years ago our trailing four month EBITDA was $638 million and we closed out this year with $1.74 billion. So EBITDA in the last three years is up 68%. And our EBITDA margin in 2010 was 26.7% and people were always challenging us about whether we’d be able to hold on to this margin. Fortunately we were able to improve them dramatically. So we picked up 610 basis points on our EBITDA margin to hit 32.8%. That’s an internal interesting number for us because the S&P 500 industrials I believe had gross margins of 32% and we now are at an EBITDA margin for the entire year of 32.8%. Our EBITDA leverage from ’10 to ’13 was about 49% over those three years. Next slide, we look at cash flow results. You can see cash flow reached $803 million. We had guided over $800 million as you may remember. Cash flow was up 61% in the last three years and in fact just in 2011, ’12 and ’13 period, we’ve generated $2.1 billion in operating cash flow which really was nearly enough to fund both the Sunquest and MHA acquisitions for $2.4 billion in that period. Our cash flow profile when you think about going forward, we trend that out. We’re going to tell you later that we think we’ll have cash conversion numbers that are somewhat similar to the ones you see here. You multiple that against your earnings assumption and you can see there's going to be a whole lot of money and cash here for us to invest. In the fourth quarter, the operating cash flow was 142% conversion there over net earnings and our free cash flow of $227 million gave us cash conversion -- free cash conversion of 137%. Next Slide, if we look at the balance sheet here at the end of the year, cash was up from $371 million to $460 million. A lot of that is outside the U.S. Undrawn revolver, you put the two together and our cash and undrawn revolver was $1.7 billion at the end of the year, almost the same as it was a year ago to $1.771 billion, even though we spent and invested over $1 billion in acquisitions. You can see the trailing 12 month EBITDA goes up to $1074 million from $925 million. So, the gross debt to EBITDA is 2.3. Net debt to EBITDA is 1.9 and of course we intend to continue to drive cash immediately this year. Next slide, here we'll take a look at the various elements of the different segments so next slide. First is, and these are just listed in an array of smallest to highest revenue; the Energy Systems and Controls segment. Their organic orders in the quarter were up 14%. So that was pretty spectacular. Organic revenue was up 3%. We had a lot of strength in Compressor Controls and actually some renewed strength in our Petroleum Analyzer Control, which has several different instrumentation businesses in it.  We did a small acquisition that we announced the last time called Advanced Sensors which is an offshore play on communicating information about the wellhead activity. And it's a small business, but it's very attractive for future growth. Zetec actually corrected itself. So it was as weak as we expected, but they had orders that tell us that really the worst is behind us in that business and that order flow in the fourth quarter will continue nicely into 2014 we believe.  If you'll look here at 2014 orientation, we're saying we ended the year with a record backlog, so that certainly helps the momentum for Energy going into 2014. We see a lot of continued strength both in LNG and refinery applications for our businesses that focus on that. We think we'll have modest increases in some of the oil and gas markets which helped some of the other businesses in Energy and the nuclear activity headwinds are behind us. So that's an easy comp for 2014 performance and we're confident that this segment as a whole will have record performance in 2014. Next slide; we look here at Industrial Technology. Orders were up 3%, really spectacular operating performance for these businesses collectively. The EBITDA margin these guys generated in the fourth quarter was 32.2% and these are in Industrial businesses. So 32.2% is pretty great and gross margins for these businesses were 51.2%. So they still are very unique in the industrial world. We celebrated Neptune's 10th anniversary in December. Very proud to say that it’s certainly been one of our incredible acquisitions over the years. 10 years into it, the leadership team is still in place with the exception of one retirement. And looking up, we've generated about $3 billion in revenue during that 10-year period with Neptune and very attractive margins. We saw improvement in our material analysis business at Struers in Denmark. They're actually much improved in Europe and doing pretty well everywhere as global industrial production picks up. Our Cornell business continues to capturing customers and had a very strong quarter around orders given rental companies picking up once again and applications for dewatering pumps and irrigation. And the oil and gas activity which affects Roper Pump remained pretty soft in the quarter. As we look at this current year 2014, Neptune continues to benefit for the Toronto Project and we expect some growth still out of U.S. homebuilding, which pretty much gives us incremental growth because we have a high percentage share of the installed base in North America, and as people build homes, they tend to use the same water meter that's already hit in that area. Roper Pumps' large diameter directional facility is actually up. It's going to ship its first product in the next two weeks. We're visiting it. That's a kick-off thing here, about two weeks. So they expect a much stronger year in '14 and we just came off of in '13, so have the capacity for these larger diameter directional drilling outfits that they're putting in place. We had modest growth in industrial production which continues to support the material analysis side of our business. And the cash flow in these businesses we expect to continue to be remarkable. These businesses collectively and the way we measure cash, return on investment are up about 50% and typical industrial businesses around 18% to 25%. So they're a wonderful group of businesses. Next slide, in RF Technology you can see orders were up 11%, revenues up 13% and operating profits up 23%. We indicated before, we thought it would be a strength in the fourth quarter. It certainly was. Project activity continues pretty much as we expected around Texas and Virginia and Florida. The Software Businesses all had relatively good quarters and mid-single-digit growth on the revenue side for them, which is pretty good because of all the recurring business they have inside their platforms. Continued strength in the products side of Radio Frequency Products and some strong growth in our U.K. Water business. For next year we enter in the case TransCore with an absolute record backlog and a strong project pipeline. One of the things that's neat again is we'll be celebrating TransCore's 10th anniversary in December of this year. So like Neptune, 10 years after it we got the margins up and growth sorted out and we'll probably complete about $5 billion in revenue during that 10 year period. So those have been two really spectacular acquisitions with longevity. Same story here other than for a couple of retirements, leadership team is in place. We've got George McGraw and Kelly Gravelle, Tracy Marks and Joe Grabias and a very strong leadership team. The next point here is modest increases in the U.K. gas and water utility business that is better than '13 was. It's going to help our Technolog business in the U.K. a bit. And then the Software businesses all continued to see mid-single-digit growth. They do have exceptional margins and it's important I think to point out with the cash margins they have, that they really drive our overall enterprise growth, quite substantially because they support so much of the acquisition investments we could make with the cash these people generate. Next slide; Medical and Scientific Imaging here is just, again long time since we've been able to say what we have at the beginning of this slide. The Imaging orders were up double digits. It's not a misprint. They actually were up double digits. Organics orders in the overall segment were up 12%. Organic revenue was down just a little bit with the strength in Medical offset by the revenue decline in Imaging, but the order situation we'll remedy that as we go into 2014. Sunquest had very strong orders. Their implementation capacity continues to improve, which is going to help us a lot in 2014. Demand is still high with people trying to get in front of the meaningful use requirements. MHA was very strong across all the alternate site health care locations, with long-term pharmacy being out in front. We're seeing a lot of potential acquisitions in the MHA space. We've spent most of the second half of this year working with MHA on various acquisition opportunities and haven't closed on any. But there're certainly a lot exciting things to do out there. In 2014, we expect imaging to improve with modest growth and easier comps, which will make the overall segment easier to talk about. Double digit revenue growth at Sunquest; we've got record backlog now and as we can continue to implement and build capacity given a strong sales pipeline, we think we'll really outperform pretty dramatically with Sunquest. Verathon is going to pick up in 2014 from a flattish year. This year they've got new and enhanced products, dramatically better quality processes that allow us to differentiate our products a little bit better. And we've got a lot of confidence in the management team. We brought a new leader in there in the second half of last year and we've got really quite a fine group of people. We've structured that business around product lines now. So people have P&L responsibility that will lower levels in the organization, which is always good. MHA growth continues with new customer additions and very favorable market conditions. I think as confident as Mike and his team are around that, the growth has just been really quite spectacular. Next slide, so here we get into the guidance arena, next slide. So, for 2014 guidance, the full year we establish at $6.05 to $6.25. Our assumptions is that revenue would be up 6% to 9% in 2014 and organic revenue would be up somewhere between 4% and 7%. Pretty much all the businesses are up mid-single-digits, but we have double-digit growth of Sunquest and MHA that will move us up to the higher end of that range hopefully.  Operating profit leverage we're assuming is going to be around 35% to 40% next year for that new revenue. But we do have a headwind that's quite an issue with tax. So you’ve got the tax rate, looks like it's going to come in between 31% and 31.5% versus 29%. If we just look at last year's results, that's a $0.20 headwind on tax. So if you look at $6.05 to $6.25 and common size it with the tax rate of the prior year, that would be $6.25 to $6.45. But we can't tell you $6.25 to $6.45 because we’re going to pay $0.20 more tax. So it’s $6.05 to $6.25, folks. Foreign exchange is assumed to be the same as it was on 12/31. Diluted share count is about 101 million. And first quarter guidance, we're coming in at $1.30 to $1.35. That gives us linearity in the year that’s consistent with normalized stuff in the past. Last year, the first quarter we had very, very low tax rate, and we’ll have a more normalized tax rate in the first quarter this year, the R&D expenses and various things John can talk about. Okay, next Slide. We go to the 2013 summary. Certainly, one of the most important things is acquiring a new growth platform in MHA which is creating a lot of opportunities for us, and it's another $1 billion addition to the continuing transformation of the company and we feel very good and confident about it. We achieved record annual results for the enterprise just across the board; orders backlog, revenue, net earnings EBITDA, operating and free cash flow. For the year, orders were up 13%, revenue was up 9%, gross margin was up 260 basis points to 58.6% for the year. Operating margin was up 130 basis points to 27%. Our EBITDA was up $148 million to $1.74 billion, and EBITDA margin was up 200 basis points to 32.8%. We had record cash flow performance. Operating cash flow for the year was $803 million which is 25% of revenue. Now usually we tell people that, they look at you like that can’t be right. No. Well, it is. Operating cash flow is 25% of revenue. Free cash flow is $760 million. That represents a cash conversion of 141%. And while we think about cash flow guidance for 2014, I think our view would be that our cash conversion on operating cash flow should be somewhere around 140%. So you can take that 140% conversion on whatever earnings number you think we have and that gives you a pretty good idea how we're starting out on our cash flow assumptions for 2014. So we thought it was a great year. Our operating people really outperformed. Had some very unusual headwinds that are all gone and behind us, and our transformation is certainly on track and we're looking forward to 2014.  So with that, we can open up for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We'll take our first question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joseph Ritchie – Goldman Sachs: So for my first question is -- well first, nice quarter, and my first question is really relating to the guidance on the incremental margins. It seems like the 35% to 40% is slightly lighter than what we’ve seen in recent years and yet you’ve continued to acquire software related asset-light businesses that have higher margins. I would have thought the margins would have been a little bit higher. So there seems to be a touch of conservativeness there. Can you just comment on the incremental that you’re expecting and why 35% to 40% is the right number?
Brian Jellison: In the fourth quarter, I think it ran 37% for operating leverage. There's a lot of amortization and these are non-cash. And so I think John can walk you through the forward mile, but we may be conservative. I hope we're conservative, but it is what it is. I think we're still -- I’m still flummoxed by the tax rate because we've got Sunquest and MHA which are our fastest growing businesses paying 40% tax. All right, John, go ahead.
John Humphrey: So it's true that Sunquest and MHA are our fastest growing businesses, but as you know their revenue base isn't all that large. So on a V basis that's definitely nice and of course on a cash basis it's even better. But we also do expect to have growth across the enterprise, not just in our software business. So we're expecting to see continued growth in our RF segment, particularly in the first half as we complete some of the projects that we have going on, and of course project revenue comes in a little lighter than some of our product revenue and definitely lighter than our software revenue. But I think that -- I think the 35% to 40% is right down the middle with respect to what we've been able to demonstrate and what we see as far as the backlog and the growth and where it's coming from in '14.
Joseph Ritchie – Goldman Sachs: And I guess one follow-up question. Perhaps, Brian you can comment on the acquisition pipeline. Clearly it's an important part of the story. It seems like you're well positioned in the first half of the year to do another large acquisition. And so perhaps you can just comment on what you're seeing in the pipeline today and what your thoughts on the market are.
Brian Jellison: Everything is for sale at the moment. I don't think I’ve ever seen as many properties that are for sale. Also, we have never seen private equity as aggressive as they are. On pricing, we’re still getting 7, 7.5 times debt staples on everything that's out there. I think putting it a little bit equity and it lines up with pretty high stuff. We remain really disciplined. I think that we will do, we would expect to do a large acquisition in 2014. We never have a timeline established about whether that's any particular point in time, but we're sitting here with a net debt to EBITDA like 1.9 times and we’re already going to generate about $800 million, $900 million or more of new cash. So we're very well positioned to be able to do $1 billion plus type acquisition. In the last several months, we’ve actually looked at a number of things that we thought would be quite in the $400 million to $600 million arena, but it is remarkable what some people have paid.  We walked away from two deals, one that looked attractive, but somebody paid 22 times trailing for it, and the other one somebody paid 23 times trailing. I don’t think that’s a new standard, but it just shows you the assets we're looking at are highly, highly sought after. So they always have to fit through this perfect hole we have. So the management teams needs to want to be part of Roper and we need one -- we need that management team to -- we want to have them be part of Roper. We have looked at a couple of very large transactions, larger than we’ve done previously, and I wouldn't rule that out. So I think the pipeline is more than adequate. It’s a more competitive process than it has been for a long time and as long as high yield debt is in our view mispriced, that’s going to be headwind for everybody.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with Citi Research.
Deane Dray – Citi Research: Hey Brian, I think you may have answered this question and I’d like to hear some specifics from John. But the issue with the tax coming up you said, I believe it was the Sunquest and MHA being taxed at 40%. So was it a mix issue that’s driving the higher tax rate and is there any opportunity for any other tax strategies throughout the year?
John Humphrey: So, the second part first. Yes, there are always things that we’re looking at, nothing that we’ve really baked into the guidance for '14 yet. But just to break down the increase in the tax rate, about half of it, so we're going from 29% up to call it 31% to 31.5% range. About half of that increase is just changes in U.S. tax law, which is the R&D tax credit not being extended into 2014, and combined with last year, we had the benefit of not only 2013, but also 2012 for R&D tax credit and a variety of other things that were expended on January 1 of '13. So they rolled into '13 instead of being in '12. So, that's about half of the increase.  We did have some tax planning initiatives that benefitted 2013 that are not expected to continue and the rest of it is the mix that Brian was talking about. We're just growing faster in the U.S. and that's where we expected to see the growth coming from in '14 and the marginal tax rate in the U.S. approaches 40%. So that pushes our tax rate up a little bit also. But we have things that we're looking at. We have projects that we're evaluating in ways to obviously always in compliance with the law but to be able to minimize taxes wherever we can and we'll update you as some of those are successful.
Deane Dray – Citi Research: Great. Then over on the businesses, the two areas that had been the softest over the past couple of quarters, Zetec and Imaging both sounded a bit better. Maybe you'd take us through the next level of detail on Zetec. What were the orders in the quarter and has there been any pricing giveback as you try to reload the backlog for this business?
Brian Jellison: Not for Zetec. A lot of Zetec is service work and the rest are probes that are now used and those are reasonable margin business banks anyway. It's just -- we had things that were going to start up that didn't. Of course, that really caused us to change our view in the third quarter. Orders came back stronger than we expected, even though they're flattish, but they're not going down. And we had a one-time large thing that happened in the fourth quarter with Zetec, so to be able to recover from that, which was a sale in the prior year of some assets. That was a big deal. On the Imaging front, the orders picking up 12% was a pleasant surprise. So what if anything's changed about the government investments and what's going to happen in academic research and changes with NIH, and more funding perhaps in 2014. It's hard to say, but all those businesses appear to be past their worst performance pattern. We've made a couple of people changes inside those businesses that hopefully are paying off already. So we'll see, but it should not be a drag on 2014.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: Out of the $3.3 billion or so in revenue you've been in 2013, how much of that would you say is from -- in two buckets; software plus SaaS in one bucket and then other recurring revenue sources in the other?
Capital Markets Inc.: Out of the $3.3 billion or so in revenue you've been in 2013, how much of that would you say is from -- in two buckets; software plus SaaS in one bucket and then other recurring revenue sources in the other?
Brian Jellison: Software, the (inaudible) -- if you look at the application software businesses, I always say -- yeah, I'll put TransCore into this activity, because all the ITS stuff, just like we had a press release. We announced that we're doing special traffic analytics and controlling all the red lights in a huge area around Sunday’s Super Bowl. You can't do that without software. Now there's human involvement too. So you're not making a disc and sending it out, but it is application software and ITS is probably our large dollar revenue business. So I didn't include it in there, John hence did not include it in there. So it depends who you ask, but as far as I'm concerned --
John Humphrey: I think you have Brian, so he'll give the answer.
Brian Jellison: If you look just like the SaaS businesses, pure software businesses, we get more than a fourth of the Company's EBITDA out of that. In reality, you really look at all of our application Software businesses, Compressor Controls for instance is an application software business. It would be much closer to half or more of the total family of activity. Here, you didn't ask but it's a more interesting thing. We've been looking at these GICS codes for a variety of reasons and we have a GICS code established, which is electronic components or electrical components. So we looked at that. We don't have a single Roper business that's in that category, not one.  So, Forrest ranking them, our biggest area is application software. Our next biggest area is health care systems. Our next biggest area is health care products and then an equivalent thing, the line of electronic instrumentation that would be more like the adjunct type of activity and not much of that goes into Industrial activity. And then we've got about somewhere between 11% and 13% that goes into Energy equipment because really our fluid handling businesses are much more oriented around Energy activity, particularly with fracing now than they used to be. And so the core industrial concept of making stuff for OEMs or making the industrial product is less than 5% of the enterprise now.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: And then just one easy follow-up, John, there was a little bit of a spike in corporate expense in the fourth quarter, is that sort of the run rate to think about or did you have a couple million of M&A related expense in there?
Capital Markets Inc.: And then just one easy follow-up, John, there was a little bit of a spike in corporate expense in the fourth quarter, is that sort of the run rate to think about or did you have a couple million of M&A related expense in there?
John Humphrey: So I would probably say yes to both of those things. We'd be looking at some level of acquisitions, like that's a part of our normal ongoing corporate activity. It will go up and down though. So it may not always hit in every single quarter. So I think building that in on an annual basis is fine, but being able to predict when that's going to happen on a quarterly basis is not quite as easy. Now also, a piece of the growth on a year-over-year basis, more so than our sequential basis is the increase in our stock price and the associated increase in equity and expense associated with that. We hope to continue that as well.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Stephen Tusa – JPMorgan: Just thinking about the sequential dynamics and what happens seasonally here. You guys had a pretty weak first quarter last year on organic down, so really there's some lumpy businesses in your portfolio at least with last year, in 2013 there were a few lumpy ones. How do we think about the organic growth dynamics in the first quarter or the first half versus the second half? I would assume that with the easy comp, the first half would be at the higher end of the range?
John Humphrey : It's a good question. The last year -- Q1 was negative organic of 3% on orders and Q2 was plus 1% and Q3 was plus 3% and Q4 was plus 4%. So I think we view our organic ought to be in this 4% to 7% throughout the year. It’s plus or minus 5% every quarter. So we don't see massive trend change. We do have a -- we should have a decent first quarter with some of the project work that we're doing. So I don't think there's a huge seasonality variant there versus whatever seasonality we have we'd expect it to be up 5%, 6%, 7% quarter-over-quarter throughout the year.
Stephen Tusa – JPMorgan: So the easy comp doesn't help your -- you're not going to be at the high end or above the high end of that range in the first quarter despite the easy comp?
John Humphrey: Yeah, I think that's true. So let’s think about that easy comp for a second. So that easy comp really was our Neptune business which had a lost customer. So it showed the decline, particularly in the first two or three quarters last year. So we do expect Industrial to be very good against a relatively easy comp in the first quarter. Other parts of our enterprise, particularly as we're building capacity around implementations at Sunquest, introduction of a couple of new products, the Verathon, as well as continuing to build momentum in the project work in our Energy Systems business, particularly in the CCC application software business. So those areas are probably a little bit more toward the back end. So, we have the easier comp on the Industrial in the first half, but more of a ramp-up that we see towards the backend on Energy and Medical, specifically.
Stephen Tusa – JPMorgan: So that balances out. One last to just follow up; any mix considerations, either positive or negative from the moving parts of this year on an organic basis; better margin or worse margin businesses coming back?
Brian Jellison: Margins are remarkably similar other than the pure software businesses. I mean, they are all pretty good. It's like EBITDA in Industrial, 32%, right. So the lower margin business would be Imaging which is a relatively small part of the total, but if you're still looking at mid-20s in Imaging. So as things grow, the big issue with mix is if we've done instead of software or hardware applications in Radio Frequency with TransCore, you get into design issues and some actual human labor in getting things installed, which all is bad margin business, but it’s part of the price you pay for the total. So some of those are really teens type margins and others would be broker type margins.
Stephen Tusa – JPMorgan: One last very quick one. Looking back at '13, it was obviously a little more choppy than I think a lot of us would have expected, especially from you guys. Did that change your view at all on hey, let's get back on the horse here and so let's set an appropriate -- be a little more appropriate in setting the targets this year or you view '13 as really a non-issue and just when thinking about setting expectations for '14?
Brian Jellison: '13 had these three unusual things in it. So we had the customer issue at Neptune, the non-recurring multiyear contract and we've gotten through that. So, it's no longer a negative. So that helps organic for this next year. We had Zetec, which was a second half of the year negative that was impossible to predict, it can't get worse literally, so, we're in pretty good shape there. Then, we had a vendor issue in the second quarter which we've never had in the time I've been here and that's behind us. We've eaten that. So that will, on a GAAP basis I think we're going to look quite strong in 2014 versus '13. We had most of our business reviews for '14 and I think we all walk away feeling like there's a lot of optimism in the field. But our guidance is conservative because of this $0.20 tax hit, right. So $6.05 to $6.25 is the equivalent of $6.45. So it's the tax that's causing us the angst of going into 2014.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
Jeffrey Sprague – Vertical Research Partners: Congratulations on the 10 year anniversaries on those big businesses. I was also wondering though, that is often a cliff point for some level of amortization. Is there a significant inflection down in amortization in either or both of those businesses here in '14?
John Humphrey: Jeff, no, not really. Most of the amortization associated with those things, it was either customer related or technology related that was amortizing has already rolled off. We have a modest amount that will give us a slight pickup at the Neptune business, but not very much.
Jeffrey Sprague – Vertical Research Partners: I was just wondering, Brian, just when you look across the health care businesses here, as we're just in the teeth of Obamacare rolling out and all this various uncertainty, is there any -- obviously you had the order pickup in the Imaging businesses, but is there any discernible change in behavior in the marketplace you're seeing from your customers or through the supply chain or anything?
Brian Jellison: Vitriol is going up with customers or as gentlemen you mentioned is to healthcare program, but for business, it doesn't really affect us that much. I mean, our products are all going into situations that are not Affordable Care Act driven behaviors. And the Sunquest situation is an enabling technology for compliance with regulations in addition to helping hospitals run better. So actually we're not really seeing anything there. We had the Medicare tax, the cost taxes, (inaudible) products. We try to keep that neutral inside the business, which has been a little bit challenging, but generally come out okay. So I don't really think there's anything -- if something changes with this in the next two years, it shouldn't really have a positive or negative effect on our results.
Jeffrey Sprague – Vertical Research Partners: And then finally, I don’t know Zetec maybe and that isn’t worth two questions on the conference call, but the outlook there, do you see anything coming out of Japan? Obviously, there's a lot of debate about whether they start the nukes or not. Is that any part of your view of the business there and how significant could that be?
Brian Jellison: This is a really small business and this business is well under $100 million in total revenue, and half of its sensors that get used to different stuff. So, there is very little materiality in that. It really is just – I don't think there's much that would happen globally or would have any material effect on Roper in any way around Zetec. This year for the full year it's certainly pulled down the Energy segment quite a bit. But Zetec is less than 10% of the Energy segment, and half of it is really sensors that can be used in all other kinds of industrial activity, and half or 60% in nuclear. So it's just not material.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: So, Brian, you did the walk by the quarters for Steve on how the organic growth range transpires through the years. Wondering if we could do that walk by the segments, how they stack up against one another?
John Humphrey: So, yeah, I can do that for you. In general, our expectation is for about the same amount of full year growth out of each of the segments, but a little more out of Medical and Scientific Imaging. So from that standpoint, Medical and Scientific because of obviously the backlog at Sunquest, the continued growth there around compliance with some of the regulations, and as people are just wanting to have upgrades and other functionality. So I don’t want to put too much on to the regulation, it’s also about increased functionality. So we see that plus the continued growth on the MHA side and some new product introductions. So we do expect more growth out of Medical than we would see out of the other three. The other three are about the same.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Interesting to hear that Industrial Tech would be grouped in as about the same. That's encouraging. And then on RF, you’ve had four quarters in a row now with record operating margin. Just wondering if you could put a little narrative behind that; do you still see runway with that segment in the margin performance?
John Humphrey: I’m sorry, Chris. What segment was that?
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: RF.
John Humphrey: So once again, with our expectation around leverage of being somewhere between 35% and 40%, that gives continued opportunity for margin expansion. Now, that’s not necessarily true for every single business, right, some of our businesses are operating at 60% plus margins. We're not looking for margin expansion there. We're looking for more growth, but for those businesses they're operating a little below our overage, as they continue to grow, they bring the margin profile up accordingly and that's really where we see in most of the opportunity on the leverage and margin expansion side.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Looking at the double-digit orders growth in Medical and Imaging, I think you probably already answered this. How is that playing out in sales? A lot of those orders are going to come in first half or is it pretty even throughout the year?
Brian Jellison: As in relates to Sunquest, they're continuing to build capacity -- human capacity to help people with their implementations. And so those implementations things are directly related to how quick client can get it installed. So, they're less time sensitive as opposed to say, it's got to get done in the year types of projects. It certainly involves manpower in the hospital, involves manpower in us and we've been building those teams very, very fast. So I think if the clients are ready to start implementing off those orders, this is a year we'll have double-digit revenue growth and order growth may or may not reach that. So the backlog is really what provides so much safety around Sunquest double-digit growth this year.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: So would you say as your portfolio has shifted with the increased number of software companies, it sure seems like maybe in the past you'd been maybe more of a book and ship on the orders, it's fair to say that your orders maybe are lumpier, but sales are still relatively even, it's fair to say?
Brian Jellison: Yeah. We were looking at that preparing for the call. I mean, we've already entered the year with about a third of the full year backlog accomplished. So you'd still have to book and ship two-thirds of the full year's guidance on revenue within the year itself. We do have a lot more recurring revenue. So what we don't report -- we only report orders if they're going to ship within a 12-month period. So there's a lot of backlog that we never identify as backlog until the cycle has come up for the year. So we know there's a lot of recurring revenue, particularly in Radio Frequency and in Medical. So the book and ship is more around Industrial and Energy. And in the application software side of the business in Energy, we can look very easily at six months out, maybe even eight months out. So it's the rest of those businesses which maybe 35% in the enterprise that are booked and shipped within a quarter.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert Baird.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Just a couple of things. On the Industrial Tech side, I presume given your segment lock-up on the growth rate, John, you're expecting Industrial Tech to grow maybe at the 4% number, maybe the lower end. I'm just curious, within that business, is it a macro expectation? Obviously, we've all seen industrial production numbers trending higher. That's the material side of the businesses. Is it mainly just a macro driver there; home starts, IP for that Industrial Tech business?
John Humphrey: So for those two portions, yes. The fluid handling portion is not as much macro as it is specific around oil and gas and some new product introductions and expansion of our own capacity in order to meet the customer demand that’s been there for a while. So I'd say it’s more in our control on the fluid handling side, more on the Industrial production and housing starts at the margin for the Neptune and the instrument side.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Your guys in the fields expect that front end O&G business to be healthier for '14?
John Humphrey: Modestly, particularly around directional drilling, not as much around rig count increase, but around feet drilled and the horizontal drilling and that’s really where more of our applications are going, whether that's on the water side for Cornell or it’s on the actual power section side for Roper Pumps.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: And then just within the Energy business, when I look at the gross margin which was fantastic for not just the quarter but the full year, does that continue to have an upward bias given that more of that is Compressor Controls, software applications? Should we just continue to expect that to see drift higher, the gross margin there?
John Humphrey: The fourth quarter is always the best margin performance for our Energy segment, particularly as instruments are sold. We still have some customer buying behavior which is more year-end budget consumption activity where they’re trying to make sure they use all of what was budgeted for the year. So the fourth quarter is always disproportionately high in terms of instrument sales and the volume associated with that helps the gross margin as well. Even though we don't have a lot of factories, we do get a little bit of absorption benefit as the volume goes up. So that's really what's driving that margin expansion. In addition to just some of the new products that are being introduced are a little bit higher margin than the things that they're replacing, but I would say that, that is incremental growth on the gross margin side, and the operating leverage that we get from that growth is going to drive the bottom-line performance.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: And then just last question, John, could you provide us the GAAP EBIT contribution for MHA in the fourth quarter, either in dollars or percent?
John Humphrey: There was really no difference on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for MHA at this point. I think we disclosed when we acquired the business that it was a very healthy margin, 2 times the Company average on an EBITDA basis. I'll have to get back with you on exactly how much the amortization is associated with that, but I think you can probably get there just in terms of the change in amortization from Q2 to Q3, but we'll follow-up with you on that specific question.
Operator: That will end our question and answer session for this call. We will now turn the call back over to Mr. John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Mary and thank you, all for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you in another three months.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: The Roper Industries Third Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. I will now turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Alicia, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our third quarter. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, who heads up Planning and Investor Relations for us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. In addition, we prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com. Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as detailed on our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. Now if you'll please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning, and also included as a part of this presentation on our website. For the third quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted consists of 2 discrete items. First, a fair value adjustment to acquire deferred revenue at Sunquest. For the quarter, this impact was $1 million to revenue and operating profit. And this also represents the last time we'll be talking about this adjustment, as we've now completed our 12 months and this deferred revenue adjustment is now completed. This adjustment does represent revenue that, absent our acquisition, Sunquest would have recognized. Second, a fair value adjustment to revenue for MHA totaling $7.9 million. Again, this represents revenue that, absent our acquisition, MHA would have recognized. We believe showing our results on this basis provides additional insight into the ongoing and recurring results of the business. Now if you'll please turn to Slide 4, I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian D. Jellison: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. So the first slide here is the quarter 3 enterprise financial results. We achieved record results in the third quarter across almost every important line, and these are substantial increases in orders, in backlog, in revenue, in net earnings, in EBITDA and in cash flow. Our orders were $846 million. Revenue was $837 million, with a book-to-bill of 1.01x, and backlog ended the quarter at $1.04 billion. Gross margin was really spectacular in the quarter, up 280 points to 58.7%. Our EBITDA was up 20% to $278 million in the quarter. EBITDA margin was also spectacular, up 240 basis points to 33.2%. Our diluted earnings per share were up 15% on the adjusted basis, and I think it was 17% on a GAAP basis. The GAAP operating cash flow was up 25% to $256 million. We'll talk a little bit more about how that positions us so well going forward. Very compelling margins and cash flow in the quarter. Next slide. If we look at the Q3 income statement, you'll see orders increased by $126 million from last year, from $720 million to $846 million, an 18% increase in orders, with organic orders up 7%. Our revenue was up 11%, with organic at 3%. We'll talk a little bit about that, as that was a little less than we'd like to have seen on organic. Our gross margin was up sharply, as I said, to 58.7%. Our operating margin, which we probably ought to talk more about, was up another 160 basis points to 27.3%. Now our tax rate actually was a $0.02 headwind in the quarter compared to the prior year actual as it increased from 29.4% to 30.3%, but that was somewhat consistent with what we expected. Net earnings, that figure is up 15% to $142 million. Now in the $142 million, we'll talk, when we get into the segment detail, about Zetec, which, against our expectations, as weak as they were, still delivered a $0.03 miss in the quarter. Next slide. The EBITDA growth and margin expansion that we continued to have for a long period of time is still very sustainable, and you see it continue to grow. So here, if you look at 2011, our trailing third quarter EBITDA for the past 12 months was $779 million. It increased $93 million in the 12-month period from the third quarter of '11 to '12 and now has skyrocketed up another $170 million in the last 12 months, ending this quarter at $1,042,000,000. That's $263 million of increase in the last 2 years on a revenue variance of $461 million. So you can run your own leverage, but it's well above 50%. If we look at the EBITDA margin, that continues to expand. In 2011, it was 28.5%. This trailing 12-month period ended at 32.6%, with actual third quarter results at 33.2%. So a 410-basis-point improvement in our EBITDA performance. And really, I suppose, on this slide, we should be detailing the other kind of margin improvements with gross margin and operating margin that continues to expand. And EBITDA -- or EBITA margins, if we look at just eliminating the D portion and look at EBITA, it was 32% in the quarter. So those amortization things, which are noncash, always are important. This is how we look at how we're doing and how we're getting all this cash. Next slide. If we look at cash flow results, you can see they just continue to move on up. Frankly, spectacular in the third quarter, $244 million of free cash flow is 29% of revenue. Now you're not going to do that every quarter, but if you look at the year-to-date results, which is what we're stressing here because of the -- trying to provide some balance, our year-to-date cash flow is up $101 million from this point last year to $567 million. That gives us a year-to-date operating cash flow of 24%, and CapEx was only $33 million year-to-date. So free cash flow is $534 million year-to-date. And of course, we continue to trend up. So even though you see year-to-date at 24%, in the third quarter only, the operating cash flow was 31%. Cash conversion is just exceptional. Next slide. We look at the balance sheet here, which continues to improve, even with our transactions. We finished the quarter with cash of $460 million and the undrawn revolver of $1,110,000,000. EBITDA, as we said, on a trailing basis is $1,042,000,000. If you look the gross debt number at $2,606 million and take away the $460 million in cash, our net debt number is only $2,146,000,000 against $1,042,000,000 in EBITDA, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.06x. So we feel we're in a very strong position from a flexibility viewpoint. Next slide. Here, we'll take a look at the individual segment details, which are really quite interesting in the quarter. Next slide. So on Energy Systems & Controls, starting from the smallest segment to the largest, they certainly had a devastatingly difficult period with the Zetec nuclear business. We had sort of indicated we thought it could be down for the balance of the year maybe $10 million. We were hoping it wouldn't be that bad, but it's actually much worse. The Zetec number in the third quarter was down 44% from the corresponding period a year ago because of this activity around shutting down various plants and not testing at the moment. And that wiped out our ability to have organic growth in the Energy segment in the third quarter. If we exclude Zetec, the segment revenue in the quarter actually would have been up 4%, not down 2%. So it's very unusual for us to have something like that, that has a distortion of the quality in the underlying businesses. All of this eventually turns into a various -- a variable positive in 2014, because these things will be tested and there will be activity. But it's just not going to happen in the second half of this year. We also saw reduced activity in upstream areas in North American oil and gas, which was more severe than we expected. That affects not only energy, but it also affects our Roper Pump business, which reports through the Fluid Handling area. Not a -- certainly, still decent business, but very disappointing in terms of organic growth in the third quarter and probably in the fourth quarter as well. That was really more than offset, though, with improving contributions from our Compressor Controls business, which really is much more of a software company, frankly, and PAC, which is focused more on the midstream and downstream oil and gas areas. If we look at orders in the quarter, they were only up 1%. But if you exclude Zetec, our orders in the quarter were up 7%. So really, without Zetec, orders up 7% and revenue up 4% would have been a satisfactory result. If we look at the fourth quarter, we did an acquisition just right here at the beginning, the first week in October, of an Irish company called Advanced Sensors, which has a new proprietary technology for remote reading of information offshore. It's a very exciting technology. We very much like the people involved in this and think they're going to add to our online reading capability of a variety of things that PAC does. We see, in the fourth quarter, continued strength at Compressor Controls. We would expect record performance there. And PAC, really started to rebound in the third quarter, even though it was off of our expectations for growth, yet still was up nominally, and it will be up again in the fourth quarter. Unfortunately, the nuclear weakness looks to continue. I think it's going to be down 40% here in the second half of the year before it starts to grow off of a ridiculously easy comp in 2014. And then the segment as a whole, we think will have kind of a mid-single-digit, 5%-plus growth in the fourth quarter. Next slide. In the Industrial Technology arena, we see there's a little bit of carryover here, with the upstream activity in oil and gas affecting Roper Pump, and to a much less degree, the dewatering pumps at Cornell. We had a decent performance there, but that coiled tubing section that goes into drilling at Roper Pump was down sharply, cost us about $5 million in revenue in the quarter. Orders, though, were up 1% reported. This will be the last quarter we have that variance around Neptune's nonrenewal on the customer side. It would have been up about 3% without that. We had very strong performance in Neptune again. It's certainly not fair to exclude the lost customer scenario, but without that, year-to-date, we'd be up nearly 11%. They had a very good quarter, very much bolstered by continued strength in Toronto, and the U.S. homebuilding gives us an opportunity to get more renewals and just add on normal replacement of water meters, plus the starts. And then this has been an extraordinary year in winning a large number of small-sized communities. I think when we -- we looked at a targeted approach that was nearing 20 and we've gotten all but one, so very successful. I think our lead-free meter experience and the cost structures we have to produce it are really demonstrating the strength we have in this unique company, because its margins are certainly similar to the segment, where other competitors are talking about gross margins in the 30s and operating margins of 15%. So it still remains the class of the water metering and technology issue. Material analysis growth, very strong in consumables at Struers, which was helpful. A slight decline in instrument sales. But in the first half of the year, their instrument sales were down more. They had very strong sales in Asia, with Japan and China, and it looks like they've turned the corner on the trend in instrument sales. We had terrific margin performance, operating margin at 30.3%, even though there was very limited sales growth in the quarter. These 30% operating margins, I think, just demonstrate the sustainability of the quality of these businesses. If we look at fourth quarter, we don't see any improvement yet in the upstream oil and gas drilling activity. If that happened, that would be helpful. We see continued growth for Neptune because of the housing starts and the growing use of lead-free meters in North America. We think that the material analysis businesses will be a little better, as we see continued improvement in instruments. And then contributions at Cornell, they've done a remarkable job this year of adding new customers, which traditionally they hadn't gone after. And those additions of new customers are starting to produce more internal organic growth, and they look to have a little bit of a rebound in the rental market in the fourth quarter. So we're feeling -- even though the performance is quite good, we think it will get to be a little bit better. Next slide. If we look at RF Technology, it's certainly had a remarkable quarter. Orders were up 13%. All of that is organic. So that's a terrific leg up, positioning us for 2014. Really, everybody in there is growing for the most part. We have broad-based improvement in toll and traffic; in the various software businesses, whether they're the subscription businesses or just licensed software; and the RF products businesses. The products are really around Inovonics, security-focused activity, and Technolog, which is our European data collection technology, they get sales[ph] through products. Toll and traffic did better, which helps account for the revenue growth of 8% and increase in OP and margin improvement, at 28.3%. And even though it was good, it was actually a little bit under what we expected in the quarter because we thought that the Virginia project would get started early. It really didn't get started until September. So what happens is that, that then rolls forward to a certain capacity constraint that the state or the authority will have and we'll have a strong fourth quarter. And then what that really means is the expectation around the third quarter will get moved to the fourth quarter -- first quarter of next year, so first half of next year will be stronger than we expected around the Virginia project, we think stronger than we expected around Texas projects and Florida. We had a terrific quarter in the campus software business, with CBORD and security applications, as we continued to get more wins from another company that's struggling at the moment. And then we have product expansion in our software businesses and continued subscriber growth. In the fourth quarter, we expect double-digit growth in the segment, certainly above 10%. The toll and traffic projects continue to ramp up. And plus, they'll carryover into 2014, so it's a great setup for us for next year. The Florida tag technology upgrade has been accelerating, where we're putting multiple protocol deployments around various places in the state so that they can read different types of tags. And they're also upgrading to a tag which has an entirely different footprint than you have been used to seeing. It's a very small tag, probably not even an inch tall and maybe 2.5 inches wide and totally flat. It's a really exciting technology for them. And we also launched, at the IBTTA conference in September, our go-anywhere pass, which, I think, people are delighted to see. There's a lot of -- we used to talk about HOV lanes, meaning high-occupancy vehicles. And now what people are talking about are managed lanes that allow people to move into a lane on a time-of-day basis or for some specific reason, and you can collect the fee off the tag. And that's opening up a number of new projects for us throughout the U.S. We think we'll have mid-single-digit growth in the software businesses and continued strength in these RF-product businesses, so a great story. Next slide. Here, we're looking at the medical and imaging business, sort of a tale of 2 different kinds of activity, but just amazing results. Orders are up 52%. Organic orders were up 9%. MHA contributed exactly what we expected, very strong cash flow, a wonderful leadership team, extremely motivated people. Substantial number of wins for Sunquest. I mean, their building book for 2014 is really ahead of schedule. I will talk more about that here when we look at the fourth quarter. We had double-digit growth in our image-guided surgical businesses, which includes Northern Digital and CIVCO. And the segment, because of imaging declining, was down about 5% in the quarter. Medical was up in the high-single-digit range to offset that. So we wound up with 3% organic growth. And of course, when we look at the overall business, revenue was up 40%, with the acquisitions' operating profit up 64% and OP margins now at 32.8% for the segment. In the fourth quarter, we expect MHA to contribute the same way as it has, and we think organic growth in medical will be sort of similar, mid digit -- mid-single-digit types of numbers on the product side. Imaging end markets are going to continue to be challenging. We think they're going to be down 10% to 12% in the fourth quarter, but we'll be able to offset that with strength in medical. Sunquest in the fourth quarter finally becomes organic. We didn't sort of split that as part of the quarter in the third quarter. And that organic growth will help our measurement when we're talking about just organic growth. Very strong pipeline of opportunities in Sunquest. We're going to enter the year with a substantial backlog around meaningful use and lab upgrades, which is driving demand. And the key for us will be our ability to execute with the implementation teams, and we're adding rapidly to those now. Next slide. Here, we get to the guidance update. Next slide. If you look at the numbers, what we've tried to do is sort of segregate this little T-account for you so that you can see what's changed on the left-hand side, what remains the same about the company and what the effect of that is. Our operating cash flow, we maintained at -- saying we're going to reaffirm we'll do over $800 million in operating cash flow despite reduction in the Q4 DEPS guidance. Our DEPS, we came in at $5.57 to $5.63 versus $5.72 to $5.86 in the past. Q4 adjusted DEPS then are $1.57 to $1.63, and we've already earned $4 year-to-date, I believe. So what's changed? Well, the Zetec nuclear business is going to be down 40%, maybe worse, in the second half. We had expected that maybe, over the second half period, we could have a $10 million headwind. But year-over-year, we're going to be down $20 million in Zetec, which was certainly not anything we ever imagined. Now the good thing about Zetec is that, from time to time, it's lumpy. And if you're off a lot, there is a permanent reduction in some aspects of it because of the closedown of 3 different reactors. But that said, they've got to test the stuff, and we're going to get that business. So it will help us next year. Oil and gas drilling activity, we think, is going to continue to be weaker than expected in the fourth quarter. That's been kind of a double-digit millions, more than $10 million headwind in the third quarter and still more than a $10 million headwind in the fourth quarter. But we're still, in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter, above last year's actual. So it's really been more a reduction in our different businesses expectations about delivery, and it's all delayed -- it's all around the upstream, nothing in the midstream or downstream is negative. Modest changes in the other end markets, mostly imaging, which is another headwind, as we said, down 10% to 12% perhaps. I guess the truth of that is that you are seeing some sequestration effect around that. Those businesses tend to be a little lower margin, so don't have as big an effect. That said, we think that fourth quarter organic growth will come in around 3% to 4%, and that's down from the 6% to 9% we had hoped for in the fourth quarter previously. But the reality is what it is, and we have to recognize that. So what remains the same about the company? Well, most of the great things that we do. Organic growth will continue to improve throughout the year. In the first quarter, we reported negative 3% organic growth and then second, up 1%. In the third now, we're up 3%, and in the fourth quarter, we expect to do better on organic growth than we did in the third. And that sort of bodes well for 2014. We've got key areas that are delivering organic growth continually, whether that's medical, it's toll and traffic, it's the water meter business and the systems around collecting data for the water meters and the midstream and downstream oil and gas and all of the software businesses. So those all are in fine shape and will do quite well. We've got this exceptional margin performance, with increasing leverage. I think probably something that hasn't gotten enough attention, which is our fault, our gross margins in the third quarter in 2011 were 53.7%. Our gross margins today are 58.7%, a 500-basis-point improvement in gross margin. And what that does for variable revenue and leverage is quite outstanding. Our cash flow is still going to be $800 million, as we said, and our disciplined deployment around cash, which we've demonstrated with both MHA and Sunquest, at a time when other people are saying it's tough to do deals. We got a lot of opportunities in our pipeline. We remain excited about what's going on in our M&A front. Next slide. So if we look at a summary of the quarter, we hate the fact that we had to lower DEPS guidance in the fourth quarter, but it doesn't mask the record Q3 results and the great setup we have for 2014. We achieved record third quarter results, and these weren't just, well, we beat by $1, these were substantial improvements in orders, backlog, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow. Orders, remember, we're up 18%, 7% of which was organic; revenue up 11%; and backlog at $1 billion; gross margins at 58.7%; EBITDA margins at 33.2%; and a $278 million contribution of EBITDA. DEPS up 15%, but operating cash flow up 25%. And our year-to-date conversion on operating cash flows, 156%. Free cash flow was up 24% to $244 million, and our year-to-date free cash flow conversion is 143%. So with that, we'd like to open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Matt Summerville of KeyBanc.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just to put this Zetec thing to bed a bit, Brian. If you look at the $0.19 reduction in EPS guidance at the midpoint, how much of that $0.19 is being driven by Zetec?
Brian D. Jellison: Well, it's quite a bit. I mean, in the second half of the year, it's going to be off at least $15 million. And so you have to use whatever assumption about its contribution would be. So it's not hard to see how it could be down $8 million or $10 million at least, and tax, it could be worse than that. So it's a significant -- it's the single biggest portion of what's going on, and then you got kind of a nut on the upstream oil and gas, which is -- caught us offguard, I'd say.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: With regards to drilling activity, I mean, it hasn't been super robust for a while. However, you had launched some new products in the market at Roper Pump. There was a pretty attractive market share story going on there. Is that still true in that regard? Have you anniversary-ed that launch and now you're seeing more of a broader market impact? Is that what's going on here?
Brian D. Jellison: No. That's a great question. The new product is called DuraTorque. It's doing very well. It's more around the directional drilling. It has a lot of different things, whether it's a mixture of wet product or dry product or gas only. It's a certain kind of thing, but our coiled tubing product, which much more is gas-oriented, is what didn't meet our expectations. We actually were up. We had year-over-year improvement. It's just that we had expected substantially more. Now the new product is doing well on certain sizes, and we're opening a new facility in Texas, which -- I mean, it's actually sort of open now, but it's all getting geared up. That will allow us to sell larger sizes. That's not yet in production, won't get in production until the first quarter of next year. So that's a positive, the -- as we gain market share with that technology in the larger sizes, but we can't produce those in Commerce. They're physically too large for our equipment.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And then just lastly, what do you think has to happen in the marketplace for you to start to see a turn in your imaging business, as this has continued to cycled down?
Brian D. Jellison: I'm looking at John. It's cycling down, but it's still -- it's better than anybody else's. It has high gross margins. It's contributing positive cash. Parts of it are really pretty good. I just don't think that the camera portion of what it is we do is a secular growth story. It requires government investment and research spending. We're in a period where that's under high scrutiny, and so there's not a lot of end-market-derived demand. There's nothing you can do to push elasticity in demand for cameras. People have to have grant money available. When they do, we get a disproportionate share of that. But if you look at any of the other people in these spaces, there aren't very many, it's kind of an oligopoly, you'll see they're all doing very poorly.
Operator: We'll go next to Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.
Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Brian, thanks for the color on the variance on 4Q. I just want to dive in to Zetec a little bit. Last quarter, you mentioned that there were -- I believe, you mentioned 4 nuclear plants that weren't going to come back. And so I'm trying to understand what the big variance was relative to your expectations for this quarter. So perhaps maybe we can start there, if you could provide a little bit more color.
Brian D. Jellison: Well, I think that people had certain expectations around various things. The San Onofre thing was a big variable that we sort of understood, and had factored that into the guidance. But these other things that have happened and not doing testing in the third quarter, fourth quarter, rolling it into 2014, was not expected. We also do a big business in Korea with that, and they've had some political issues over there with information reporting. And so the normalized business we would have expected there didn't occur. There -- it's just been sort of a dark period, if you will, in the second half. Our people in that business, I mean, we -- in our quarterly review, they detailed a bridge down to $100,000 of variance from a walk last year. So it's one of the things -- they tell you exactly what didn't work and in terms of why, and they would say, "Well, it's just external things we have no control over, and we'll get most of it back next year." But it certainly -- it's not a growth business. It's more of a cash cow. But next year, because of this ridiculous collapse of its revenue in 2013, it will be a temporary growth business.
Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So is this something that then continues to bleed into the first half of next year because, really, the problem started surfacing last quarter?
Brian D. Jellison: Well, it's not expected to at all. It's expected that these things that are not happening in the second half would begin to happen again, favorably, in the first half, although I don't think they know what the detailed schedules are. We took quite a few people out of this business, I think like 24 or something like that, and didn't comment on that in terms of the cost to take them out. But that's about as much as you could do without eating into people that are really field service engineering people and guys that work on the algorithms and analysis for everybody. But the cooling towers are still in operation, and there are mandatory checks and they'll happen. So it's certainly not a part of our growth strategy. It's just been an unfortunate problem for us in the second half of the year.
Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. I think just switching gears a little bit into some of the tolling projects. I think, last quarter, you mentioned that the Florida tag was moving into 4Q, could slip into 1Q. I missed your comments earlier. Perhaps you can talk a little bit about that confidence that you have in Florida tag, specifically for 4Q. What's embedded into expectations? Or has that slipped out into 1Q? And maybe some commentary around Virginia and Texas as well.
Brian D. Jellison: Well, we're going to have a terrific fourth quarter in toll and traffic. I mean, it's going to be very, very, very strong. The dynamic for the second half of the year, though, was we've had some projects that we expected would start earlier in the third quarter than they did. And so third quarter was good, but could have been substantially better. The ability of these agencies to deploy various things is kind of a fixed deployment. And so we'll have an exceptional fourth quarter, but that will then carry over into a very strong first half of the year for toll and traffic. I mean, I think John's going to be comfortable to say toll and traffic is going to be up over 15%, maybe more, in the fourth quarter of this year. So there really aren't any problems there. It's just a slower start than we expected.
Operator: We'll go next to Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Just looking at the RF and how the backlog and quotation activity is maybe setting up for the 2014 top line. If you could comment on that. And is there any sense that 2014 could be pretty front-end loaded in terms of the full year expectation?
Brian D. Jellison: Oh, I wouldn't say -- I mean, we're not going to give you a lot of guidance around '14, but we're going to feel pretty good about it. So John, why don't you...
John Humphrey: Yes. And the projects that we have going on that, of course, started to revenue in the third quarter but really ramp-up a little bit more in the fourth, which is Virginia, as well as the Houston project, where we're replacing an awful lot of lane equipment with some of our proprietary lane equipment, in addition to the continuing Florida tag upgrade project. Those things started to ramp in Q3. They kind of reach a steady-state level in Q4. We expect that steady-state level to continue into Q1. And then we'll just -- I vow[ph] that they'll all have various times when they start to complete, but I don't think any of those projects will be completed even in the first quarter of next year.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then a big-picture question on operating margins for you guys. They're very high, obviously, across the segments. And just wondering if you could comment, what are the drivers from here in terms of mix, volume, leverage, et cetera. If you can kind of tackle that question on a segment-by-segment basis.
John Humphrey: Sure. So I think the place to look for insight into that is what the gross margin is for each of the 4 segments. So I think if you look at our medical and imaging segment, where our gross margin has now reached 70%, I think it's fair to say that every incremental dollar of revenue there means more than it does, say, in our industrial business. We love our industrial businesses, but we have gross margins there that are right at 50%. So you have a different level of contribution that's going to come from growth in our core medical area. And also, once you start to look over at RF, where our gross margins are also pretty high, largely as a result of our SaaS and software businesses. So in those areas where we have outsized growth, software, medical, MHA and Sunquest and things like that, then that -- I mean, that should convert at probably 50%, or maybe even a little more. In those areas like industrial and our core energy businesses, those things are probably closer into the 35% range. And so I think as you start to see us continue to build in some of those areas, I think you'll see the incremental leverage associated with that, and that's really what's going to drive the operating profit improvement as we go forward.
Operator: We'll go next Deane Dray of Citi Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Brian, back in September, you were describing the M&A environment and specifically, pricing of assets. I think the word you were using was horrendous. Maybe give us an update on the pipeline. And as your leverage comes down now well below your normalized leverage rates, do you have a Plan B in terms of capital allocation or you just want to keep all the gunpowder dry?
Brian D. Jellison: Oh, no. I mean, we're always involved in something. I would say that the pricing and seller expectations are as horrendous as they were before, which is why you're seeing a lot of things not getting done out in the marketplace. I mean, we're fortunate to continue to find things that we think are great additions to the family, and we can do that by offering people opportunities to be part of Roper in a way that works for them and still doesn't blow out pricing multiples. Their -- the pipeline is really quite large. There are a lot of different things that we're -- it would be a rare moment that we're not looking at 3 or 4 things simultaneously. And so I -- we don't have, like, a budgeted thing like, "Gee, you did a $1 billion deal in the first quarter. Are you're going do another one in the fourth quarter?" It doesn't work like that. I mean, we do them when everything sort of aligns. We like the management team, we like the core market, we think we can add some value to it, we think it's a cultural fit and we think the numbers work out over time. And we're definitely seeing things like that. Now that said, when the debt staples are as enormous as they are, oftentimes 7x debt-to-EBITDA, it gets stapled to a transaction. And junk bond, kind of high yield, if you want to call it that, is still very low, so it drives up the multiples. And that's as horrendous now as it was whenever I made that comment.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then I know this was a knit last quarter, but is the chapter closed on the Hansen refrigeration valve story?
John Humphrey: No, it's not. And so we continue to go through that process. We've shipped out roughly half of the affected valves, but we have not received as many back. So that process, for the field and for our installation partners, is still continuing as far as them being out in the field and replacing those products. But we're fully engaged on that. We expect to be about 90% completed with that part of the project by the end of the year. And we're still in the process of discussing with the supplier, the -- any restitution. So we will call that out once anything like that happens. As Brian mentioned back at the second quarter call, it's a pretty small company, not a lot of capital there. But we're still looking for the ability to offset some of this $9 million that we're having to spend in order to make sure our customers stay whole.
Operator: We'll go next to Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Brian, could you just talk for a couple of minutes about both MHA and then also Sunquest? You had mentioned Sunquest's backlog pipeline was strong. Does Sunquest now start to look like a mid-single-digit grower as it becomes core sales? And then the follow-up question to that is, if you look at those 2 acquisitions, MHA and Sunquest, if I make some estimates as to what their contribution margin in the quarter was, does the core business in med scientific, did they make progress on their margins or they slipped a little bit?
John Humphrey: So I'll address at least the first one of those, talking a little bit about our expectations for Sunquest. They've built, I mean, just a tremendous backlog with not only upgrades but also new facilities, so new badges as well, particularly as hospitals are continuing to comply with meaningful use regulations in order to be able to drive additional revenue into the hospital system. One of the ways that they can do that is better utilization of information, and MHA -- and Sunquest allows them to do that. So that's quite a bit of the backlog that we've been able to build there, and we expect that to start to deliver. It's already started deliver, but continue to ramp up deliveries against that in 2014, even in 2015. So I think -- I mean, you mentioned the mid-single-digit growth area. I would definitely expect that, and we would actually hope for a little bit more than that. And as we look forward -- so even if you exclude the contributions of both MHA and Sunquest, we did have margin expansion across the company. We had good incremental leverage on our -- on the 3% growth. Of course, it was 3% growth, so that incremental leverage works out to be, I think, in the mid-30% range, if my recollection is correct.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. So the core in medical scientific, the incrementals is still kind of mid-30s there despite the weakness on the imaging side?
John Humphrey: Yes, that's correct. That's correct. It's really because -- actually, because -- even if you exclude the contributions of MHA and Sunquest, so talking specifically just for that segment, we still had net organic growth there, largely driven by our image-guided medical products.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then just a real quick question. This Advanced Sensors business that you acquired, could you just give an approximate revenue size for that?
Brian D. Jellison: Well, it's really a new technology. So it's -- I mean, they have an expectation that they would be in excess of $10 million, but it could be really substantially better than that. They have a very substantial ramp that they think they'll get, and we'd like to believe they're right. But it's a [indiscernible] margin business. And they really do have a proprietary technology that when you see it, it's remarkable because, today, the way people get information at the wellhead or on the platform is archaic. And you could be sitting somewhere else and getting this information feed basically through a very different type of access technology. And it's where -- I mean people kind of see it and don't believe it. It was introduced in the second half of this year at a trade show, and they are under siege for people wanting to buy the product, which was one of the reasons that we were able to come in and acquire the company, because it requires some investment and has very interesting forward prospects.
Operator: We'll go next to Mark Douglass of Longbow Research.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Brian, as we think about the risk to organic growth, not only in fourth quarter, but also looking to '14. Guidance taken down a couple of times. 35% organic growth guide earlier this year, not going to hit it. Obviously, Zetec is a big part of that, oil and gas. Are there other parts of your business where you're just lacking real strong confidence that things are going to turn? Or can you just talk about other risks in other businesses?
Brian D. Jellison: Well, in the fourth quarter, it's really driven quite substantially by these 3 things: the sort of almost freeze on nuclear activity, and then the upstream oil and gas, and then the camera reductions. Those make up the lion's share of everything. When you look about 2014, we're going to get solid growth out of all the RF businesses, we expect, and solid growth out of our existing medical product businesses and really, sort of everything in that capacity. Energy has had a somewhat disappointing year in 2013. So it sets up for pretty easy comps in 2014. And then you have industrial, which will have capacity that we don't have today for higher-diameter DuraTorque products in Texas. We think -- we've had 2 or 3 things this year that aren't going to repeat. So you ask this customer renewal situation, which was millions and millions of dollars, and you've got -- you're past the Zetec situation, which is millions of dollars. So we're setup for comps in '14 better. Now we haven't gone through our planning with all the field people, but we're looking forward to a strong year.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. But nothing -- I mean, any areas where you're just getting perpetually weaker without any of these big kind of onetime...
Brian D. Jellison: No, not at all. I think what you have is just you've got a pretty slow growth macro economy. And so there are guys who are looking to grow at twice GDP. You're looking at a pretty lousy GDP base off of which to grow. So if you get 3%, 3.5% GDP growth that some people think you'd get in '14, I mean, that's going to help some of those kind of businesses.
Operator: We'll go next to Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: On that gross margin improvement, obviously, another great quarter there. Is there anything -- I know there's a mix dynamic because you've been buying stuff that's a little more high gross margin. What would you point to as kind of the 1 to 2 things that you're doing there? Is it mix? Is it -- it's kind of hard to -- for us to reach in and analyze that gross margin. It's just so strong that maybe if you could talk about a couple of the big drivers there over the long -- over the last couple of years.
Brian D. Jellison: Well, I think there's 2 different things, right? So the kind of things we've been acquiring have been high-margin businesses. Many of them get paid in advance for what they do, which drives so much of the positive you see here around cash. The other businesses have sort of focused on different kinds of disciplines around our market share and customer profitability. So they work very hard on making sure they're serving customers that make sense for them to serve, and not wasting time selling to people that are high maintenance and low margin. Our guys have a very disciplined approach around product development, and when they're looking at their product roadmaps, they're looking at ways to have contributions from the new products that are higher than contributions they had from the old products. So that continues to sort of anniversary beneficially to us. Now when you move 500 basis points up in 2 years, from the 53.7% to 58.7%, certainly, some of that is due to Sunquest and due to MHA a little bit in the third quarter. But pretty much everybody has improving gross margins.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right, right, yes. No, it's definitely pretty broad-based when you look back over the last couple of years. There's not really 1 segment that's carrying you there. On the leverage, is there a target where you would get more aggressive? Or are you pretty comfortable here deploying capital at 2.5x -- I think it's gross -- 2.5x gross?
Brian D. Jellison: Yes. I think we've said 2.5x, but 2.5x to 3x because we have so much cash. It really assembles so quickly for us. We wouldn't have any problem being at 3x or slightly above 3x for a temporary period, if we had a clear pathway to reduce it back. But from a sort of planning or modeling viewpoint, we'd like to think we're more like 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA on a gross basis. But we're not uncomfortable at a little over 3x as long as it doesn't stay there.
Operator: We'll go next John Quealy of Canaccord.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: It's Chip Moore for John. On Zetec, it sounds like you have pretty good visibility on things coming back next year. Can you just talk a little bit about historical precedents, if you've ever seen delays like this?
John Humphrey: Not to this magnitude, no, where you have both a little bit of an impact from plant shutdowns and actually mothballing some nuclear facilities, in addition to what is a little more normal for Zetec, which is lumpiness. So quarter-to-quarter, lumpiness for Zetec is not a surprise. What we're seeing here in the second half is more than what we've seen in the past. So when you talk about visibility, it's one of those things that when I look 12 months out and look at what's going to happen over a 12-month period, there's actually better visibilty than looking out over a 3-month period, just because some of these things can be pushed or delayed, but they can't be eliminated, right? You still have to -- I mean, there are still regulations around shutting down and testing the cooling tower and the tubes and the other parts of the process. So that part can't be eliminated, but it can be postponed sometimes. And so that part is not unusual, but what we're seeing this time is unusual.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And just a follow-up to that. You've mentioned taking some costs out there as you look forward. Assuming it bounces back next year, what kind of benefit can that have?
Brian D. Jellison: It's a modest benefit. People are not that expensive. It's 24 people times whatever, and some of them would be variable, you'd bring them back. So not material to anything Roper does.
John Humphrey: Right.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Alex Blanton of Clear Harbor Asset Management.
Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC: This is sort of a nonquantitative question. You've had a lot of those so far today. But given the unusual nature of some of the problems that you've had here in the second half, I mean, you don't usually have misses in earnings estimates and guidance. How much of a distraction have these problems been, if any, to management in pursuing its acquisition program? Because that seems to have slowed a bit at the same time as some of these problems cropped up. Has there been a problem or not?
Brian D. Jellison: Not a problem at all, and I'm not sure how you could say it slowed. I mean, we invested $1 billion this year in the MHA acquisition. And that's...
Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC: Well, that's true, but I mean in the fourth quarter. In fourth quarter, we didn't see much.
Brian D. Jellison: Well, hold on. I mean, this is the most aggressive acquisition investment deployment policy in the history of the enterprise in the last 2 years, over $2.5 billion. And we just announced the bolt-on now. So good Lord, what would you want in acquisitions. So our capital deployment is just off the charts compared to anybody else.
Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC: Okay, okay. So you anticipate some good stuff coming in 2014, that I gather from that?
Brian D. Jellison: We always expect good stuff to come. I mean, we are going to deploy capital. We have proven that for a long number of years, and we're going to continue to deploy capital in great opportunities.
Alexander M. Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC: And would you say that you've got the operating management in place to handle the problems you've had effectively and minimize them?
Brian D. Jellison: I do think that. I think that these are macro trends and upstream stuff that has nothing to do with the quality of the management that we have at Viatran and the diesel engine shutoff valve business and some of the core AMOT businesses and certainly, the coiled tubing aspect at Roper Pump or dewatering pumps or any of these things. The underlying nature of those businesses is outstanding. You can see it by the sustained operating profit margin they have and their product roadmap. So I think that's fine. And any acquisitions we do, frankly, come with quality management teams. So assimilating them isn't very risky. So I think we're -- I mean, I could tell you that we have the best leadership group here at Roper right now that we've ever had, and it's stronger today than it was 5 years ago. So I don't think it has anything to do with sort of taking your eye off of anything. It's really the incredible negative reaction to people who were going to bring up nuclear power plants, who aren't the people who are mothballing them, and the big falloff in gas activity and sort of modest falloff in rig counts.
Operator: That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We will now return back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Alicia, and I thank all of you for joining us today. And we look forward to talking to you again in 3 months, when we finish up the fourth quarter.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-07-29 08:30:00) =====

Operator: The Roper Second Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. I will now turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
John Humphrey: Thank you. And thank you, all, for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our second quarter. Joining me this morning is: Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, Director of FP&A and Investor Relations. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com. If you please turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. Next slide. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation, which is available on our website. For the second quarter, the difference between GAAP and adjusted consist of these 3 discrete items. First, a fair value adjustment to acquired deferred revenue at Sunquest. For the quarter, this impact was $2.4 million to revenue and operating profit. This adjustment represents revenue that, absent our acquisition, Sunquest would have recognized. Second, a fair value adjustment to revenue for MHA totaling $18.5 million. Again, this represents revenue that, absent our acquisition, MHA would have recognized. Finally, we included in our press release a one-time charge related to a vendor-supplied component that did not meet our quality standards. This component is used in our Hansen business, Hansen, which provides refrigeration valves for cold storage applications. The $9.1 million charge in the quarter is our accrual for the estimated cost of this replacement program, and any expected recovery from our supplier will be tracked and reported in the same way as we continue throughout the year. We believe showing our results on this adjusted basis provides additional insight into the ongoing and recurring result of the business. Now if you'll please turn to Slide 3, I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian D. Jellison: Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. So we'll start off with the Q2 results at the next slide. On the enterprise financial results for the second quarter, it was a record quarter for Roper. We had record orders, we had record backlog, record revenue, record net earnings and record EBITDA. So orders for the quarter were $835 million and revenue came in at $805 million, representing a book-to-bill of 1.04. The gross margin was up 300 basis points to 57.9%, really spectacular results. And all 4 of the segments expanded their gross margins, so it wasn't just a benefit of the MHA acquisition. EBITDA in the quarter was up 21% to $259 million, so we're tracking at greater than $1 billion of EBITDA now. Our EBITDA margin increased 270 basis points in the quarter to 32.2%. And I should really remind everybody that we have very little depreciation, so it's really all about intangible amortization that's noncash. And so our intangible amortization is now forecasted to be about $150 million for the year, all of our amortization, whereas depreciation is more like in the low 40s and CapEx will be similar to that. Our GAAP operating cash flow was up 17% to $140 million and our diluted earnings per share were up 14% to $1.31. We really thought that was a very compelling performance in a second quarter. Next slide. If we look at the income statement, here, you'll see that comparison of orders, up $835 million against $763 million last year. On the revenue basis, the revenue was at $805 million versus $725 million, so up $80 million or 11%. 1% of that was organic, and when we get to industrial, I'll comment on the fact that we still have that Neptune customer transition going on or organic would've been a little over 2% for the enterprise. Our gross profit soared from 54.9% to 57.9%, up those 300 basis points. Operating income reached $210 million in the quarter so that margin for operating income went from 24.7% to 26.1%. And of course, if you looked at that on an operating margin plus noncash amortization, the number would be well above 30%. That operating performance includes the cost of our MHA deal expenses, which we've taken against normalized earnings. That would've added back another $0.01 or more. Interest expense went up in the quarter, of course, with the paying for MHA's interest cost. So we'll cover more around that on the balance sheet. And then the tax rate increased 150 basis points. Last year's second quarter was 29.6%; this is 31.1%. So that created a $0.03 headwind in reported earnings here. Notwithstanding that $0.03 on tax and our $0.01 on MHA, we still reported $1.31 for DEPS. Next slide. Here, if we look at our EBITDA growth continuing, I want to talk a bit about leverage here. When you look at the slide, our trailing 12 months EBITDA ending in the second quarter of 2011 was $739 million. This year, our trailing 12 months EBITDA is $995 million. So in just 2 years, we've added $256 million of EBITDA and our margins have expanded tremendously. Two years ago, our trailing EBITDA margin was 28.1%, as you can see on the slide. This year, it's 32%, so we're up 390 basis points on our EBITDA margin. Our gross margins, in 2011, those trailing 12-month number were 54%. In 2012, they went up to 54.6%. And this year, on a trailing basis, our gross margin is now 57.3%. If you look at the leverage then, we have $995 million of EBITDA against a trailing 12-month revenue number of $3,112,000,000 and you compare that to the 2011 trailing 12-month revenue of $2,630,000,000. So our sales in that 2-year period are up $482 million. Our EBITDA increased from $739 million to $995 million, so it's up $256 million. And our leverage on sales to EBITDA is 53.1% in that 2-year period. So we still continue to drive outstanding leverage with every new dollar of incremental revenue. Next slide. If you look at the cash flow, you'll see cash flow in the first half of the year reached $311 million. That represented 20%. The operating cash flow is 20% of our revenue. Cash flow in the second quarter was up $140 million on an operating cash flow basis, 17% above last year. Our free cash flow was $129 million, up 19% over last year. And the strength of this gross margins and our cash flow performance gives us the confidence to say we're still on track for $800 million or more of full year operating cash flow. Second -- next slide. So here, if we look at the balance sheet, you'll see cash at the end of the second quarter was $375 million. Our undrawn revolver was all the way back up to $1,458,000,000 out of the $1.5 billion that we have access to, so lots of repayment. We also, of course, issued these $800 million notes. But when you look at that undrawn revolver at $1,458,000,000, we'd want to note that we have a $500 million bond that comes due on August 15. So that'll be paid out of the revolver, still leaving us well over $1 billion of investable opportunity over the next several months or into the first part of next year. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA at $995 million, creates these debt stats you see below. Gross debt is $2,758,000,000. And of course, net debt being substantially less than that. The net debt to EBITDA is 2.4x, so we are really positioned to do another $1 billion transaction by the first part of next year. Pipeline continues to be very good. We see lots of opportunities. And we remain disciplined around what we're going to deploy and when we're going to do that. Next slide. If we get into the very specific segment details, next slide, we'll start with Energy Systems & Controls here on Slide 11. Compressor Controls had another very good quarter in the second quarter. The bolt-on acquisitions we did to them some time ago, United Controls and Trinity, are starting to do a little bit better. A downside was Zetec's nuclear business was down really significantly. There were 4 nuclear plants in the quarter that announced they're not going to restart. And one of those, San Onofre was a very significant revenue stream for us, planned for the balance of the year, and also Kewaunee and Palisades, both announced in May. So we look at the steam gen portion of Zetec for the balance of the year having a really dramatic headwind, somewhere as much as -- it could reach $10 million versus last year's numbers. We also saw weakness in European tire manufacturing business that's primarily supported by our Alpha instrumentation company, although strength in many other areas for them. We had very strong margin performance due to growth in the higher-margin areas of the business and cost actions that were taken early in energy that have very quick paybacks. If we look at EBITDA performance here, you can see EBITDA for the quarter was 30.2%. That was up 100 basis points over the second quarter of last year and orders were up modestly even despite the difficulty at Zetec. For the second half of the year, we're starting to see Compressor Control bid projects on the rise again. We had felt those were a little softer than we would've expected coming into the year, but boy, that's no longer the case and in fact, we have a very full agenda on bids. We expect double-digit growth in the oil and gas portions of our energy business. And that's going to get led primarily by PAC's refinery instrumentation business and by Compressor Controls and United Controls. We think we'll have a strong seasonal fourth quarter. Frequently we do in these businesses and there's no signs that, that's not going to occur this year. We have the headwinds that I mentioned on the nuclear end markets that are going to impact the growth or sort of pull down or mask the core growth of everything else because of the steam generation falloff. But we do have better adoption in our industrial activity around sensors and control systems that we've developed for those markets so we still expect a strong second half of the year in energy. Next slide. In Industrial Technology, here, we had orders up 200 -- or up to $205 million. Revenue, while it's reported down 3%, if you exclude the Neptune customer transition from the segment, the segment would've been up over 2% organically instead of showing down 3%. We had more than a $10 million -- $1 million drag in Q2 for this Neptune transition, which will be largely behind us soon in the second half of the year. We think that's only about a $5 million drag. So this was the last big quarter for that. Materials analysis in the businesses continued to be modestly lower, but the consumables were steady. So we think we're in pretty good shape in that area. Our fluid handling business continues to do exceptionally well. We get share gains in the oil and gas industry and the new products that we have are doing very well. And we've had great margin performance. The EBITDA in Industrial Technology was 32.9% for the quarter. And OP margin, as you can see here, is 30.2%. So it's truly remarkable. Book-to-bill was fine at 1.04. But in June, sort of later in the month, we got into a discovery around this problem at Hansen, which is really a vendor problem of what's painfully a $2 part. And the root cause of this is clearly a vendor using the wrong protective spray on this part. To remedy it and be really fair to all our customers, we really feel we want to replace those installs that occurred during a multi-month period. We've had discussions with the vendor. The vendor is not well-capitalized. There are things we have to do with that vendor. But no matter what, we have to take care of customers in this case. And it's really the time to sort of apologize to our Hansen customers. We really have a dominant position in the refrigeration valve business. Hansen has been around for over 25 years. They've been a consistent growth provider for our fluid handling business. They've got a great team, but they've got a vendor who proved unreliable and all we can do is what we're going to do, which is way beyond the warranty expectation to replace these items, which, unfortunately, involved labor on the part of our dealer network and we are internally thankful for the work they're doing. In the second half of the year, as we said, the Neptune headwind kind of goes away. It's about a $5 million drag so that'll make everything look better. And strength in the U.S. homebuilding, we think, will still be quite fine, which gives us more new housing starts means more water meters. We see broad-based fluid handling growth in the industrial and agricultural, municipal and oil and gas arenas. We've got the Texas expansion for Roper Pump moving into a new facility that's on track. We expect it to up and producing in the first quarter of 2014. And that's going to drive additional growth for us in 2014 with those new products we have that are used in the shale gas drilling opportunity. But we do have this disruption in the refrigeration valve business of Hansen, which will be a little bit a drag on the Industrial Technology's reported numbers. Next slide. We look at the RF Technology business. Here, year-to-date, this business, orders are up 10% over the prior year. Second quarter was down a bit but that's because last year, we had an extraordinary second quarter for toll and traffic, which booked the Houston project. And the result of that is they had nearly 1/3 of their full year orders hit in the second quarter last year. So it's just a difficult comparison. But first half of the year is up 10%, backlog is terrific. We had high single-digit growth in our software businesses that were led really by education and transportation end markets. Toll and traffic was led by the Houston project, which is well underway. We had really terrific growth from our wireless sensor business, Inovonics and Mark Jarman and his team in Boulder have done a remarkable job in getting that thing turned around and rebounding nicely. Now they're getting the benefit, of course, of submetering for apartment buildings. They get the senior care growth and the security products that we distribute. So that's had a very nice bounce for us. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.08. The backlog in RF Technology is now up 11% since the end of last year. That takes us then into the second half next year with a pretty -- or this year with a strong opportunity. The toll and traffic projects are going to drive significant revenue growth in the second half. Texas is on track, Virginia is starting up and on track for performing. Our Florida tag upgrade is underway, but it's ramped up much more slowly than was expected. And that's resulted in us moving some earnings into the fourth quarter that we would've originally expected in the third quarter. And in fact, some of that could slop over into 2014, still gives us the strong year performance on the Florida tag upgrade but does hurt the third quarter. Our continued subscriber base growth in the SaaS businesses continues to be at mid- to high single-digits. We don't see any changes there. The segment's definitely positioned for double-digit growth in the second half of the year. Next slide. If you look at Medical & Scientific Imaging, which, of course, is now our largest segment and for the second half of the year, that will really be true. Just a lot to say about this segment. The MHA acquisition really becomes transformational for us when you put MHA and Sunquest together. You can look at this OP margin and table; the OP margin in the second quarter was 29.9%. Now that's OP and it includes intangible amortization, so the EBITDA is much higher. That OP margin is up 630 basis points over the same period last year. And revenue, up 52% and OP, 92%, is just a reflection of the acquisitions. When we look at what's happened at scientific [ph] imaging, a year ago, it was over 40% of the segment's reported revenue. And this year, it's not even reaching 30% here. So it's just over 1/4 of the revenue in the segment in the second quarter. And that just becomes transformational in all of our numbers. You see book-to-bill at 1, and that's nothing to be alarmed about because, again, the model has changed. With Sunquest and MHA having dramatically higher book-and-ship within any given quarter, you won't see these big fluctuations on book-to-bill here that we had in the past. Mid-digit, single -- mid-single-digit organic growth in medical, we would expect to -- again, it was driven in the second quarter by image-guided surgery applications. That's both our Northern Digital and CIVCO businesses and ultrasound consumables. And the Sunquest opportunities are finally accelerating due to our system upgrades and new modules. We had quite a bit of new commitments for those products. We had the continued weakness that sort of is expected in the imaging end markets. We're not seeing any real improvement in the research markets. They were down high single-digits and sort of flattened the organic growth in the segment, which otherwise would've been mid-single-digits or above. If we look at the second half of the year, we can see sustained strength in the medical products, which will, again, be led by our image-guided surgery applications and some new Verathon international growth, which looks quite good in the second half. We don't expect any real improvement in the scientific imaging end markets. That would be certainly a bonus if it were there, but we don't see that. Sunquest growth becomes organic in the fourth quarter, which will certainly help our organic reporting statistics. We would expect high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter out of Sunquest, maybe a little better. MHA will add to our growth in the second half of the year. And all the early performance that Mike and his team are delivering out of MHA just add more confidence to what they'll be able to achieve this year and in the future years going ahead. Next slide. Here, we get to talk about the guidance. So the next slide. The 2013 guidance, the second half will be led by those things we talked about. It will be growth in medical from the acquisition itself and organic growth. Organic growth in toll and traffic, oil and gas and fluid handling. We would expect the second half sequentially to be up over $225 million over the first half and up over 15% over the first half in revenue. Our Q3 adjusted DEPS guidance is $1.40 to $1.46, with kind of mid-single-digit organic growth expected. And we'd like for that to be a little higher, but we just can't move it up, we are not willing to move it up higher than that because of the Florida tags moving into the fourth quarter. It doesn't change the full year much. So on our full year adjusted DEPS guidance, we're in at $5.72 to $5.86. So we took $0.04 off the lower end and $0.08 off the higher, $0.06 off the midpoint, really driven by 2 things that we just don't see any possibility of improving: the nuclear business, which is going to cost us several cents with this revenue that's no longer going to be available that was planned; and then, a lack of any turnaround in the life science research market. Full year operating cash flow, though, we still see it as being $800 million or more. And part of the benefit of that is stronger organic growth, certainly well above that 6%, could be 8% or 9%. In the fourth quarter, it gives us a gross margin, which continues to improve. And those gross margins are going to expand in the second half that'll help bolster earnings and cash flow. So we remain confident with this guidance at $5.72 to $5.86. Next slide. If you look then at the summary of how the quarter came in for the company, notably, we achieved record results in the second quarter, certainly not the easiest economy to report record results in when you're looking at all those things, orders and revenue and net earnings and EBITDA. Our book-to-bill ratio came in well above 1 again. We've got a $1 billion -- a little over $1 billion backlog, which is up 17%. $1 billion backlog certainly eases what we need to do in the second half to drive the guidance that we've just confirmed. The gross margin's up 300 basis points to 57.9% with expansion in all 4 segments. Those gross margins are significant and more importantly, they're sustainable. So we believe that's the kind of gross margin we'll be producing in the second half of the year, if not better. Our EBITDA in the quarter at $259 million represented a 270 basis point improvement to 32.2%. When you look at sustainability, remember the 12-month trailing average EBITDA is 32%, so things are in a very good place for us. Our free cash flow was up 19% to $129 million. MHA is on board. It's off to a great start. We got the $800 million bond offering completed that restoked the balance sheet so that we're able to use our revolver for acquisitions going forward. And DEPS were up 14% to $1.31. We expect a much stronger second half. And with that, we're good for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Matt Summerville from KeyBanc.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions. First, with respect to Zetec, Brian or John, can you remind us how big that business is, what sort of cost actions you're taking as this resets to what I assume will be a permanently lower level and what ultimately you think that level of revenue is?
Brian D. Jellison: So Zetec is really a bifurcated business. We have a business, which is around sensors that uses eddy current for a variety of applications. And then we have a business which we originally acquired, which was focused on steam generation, which is the fueling tower application for nuclear plants. We've never really given any specific numbers. But I think we've probably said it's somewhere between 12% and 15-or-so percent of the segment. The reality is that we're looking kind of at a $10 million divot in 2013 versus 2012; might not be quite that bad because the eddy current sensor business is growing. And so if we can get that thing to grow a little bit better, it will help offset a little bit. But we had well over $5 million of revenue and $10 million planned. So I mean, we really did not expect the closure of San Onofre. That -- maybe reading about it, there were a lot of people, who didn't expect it and aren't happy about it. San Diego is wondering how they're going to produce energy but that's a problem they have to deal with. But thinking about next year, I wouldn't make -- it's not like -- we expect the business to develop new product in new markets and make up for those problems. So I don't -- it's not like -- I wouldn't reduce our model by $10 million in perpetuity because of what happened this year on that, maybe $5 million.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then my follow-up, for CCC, what are you seeing that's driving the change in bidding activity? And can you frame that up numerically at all?
John Humphrey: So the places where we're seeing a lot of bid activity, it actually moves beyond. So we have pipeline applications, particularly with some technology with the United Controls. So the UCG acquisition, the bolt-on we did about 2 years ago, some of that technology is able to be applied to some additional pipeline opportunities that we really didn't have technology for back when it was only CCC. So that's been helpful. And there's more activity on the upstream side. So CCC has done quite a bit on the upstream side, particularly on offshore platforms with control systems for compressors in those situations. And so they're seeing more activity there. I mean, predicting win rates is always a difficult thing, but there is sufficient bid activity there for us to see CCC as being somewhere between mid- and high single-digit growth for the next few years.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with Citi Research.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Brian, for the lower guidance on 2013, I think you've given a good explanation on the Zetec side. But you mentioned also the lower life science research. Is that in the imaging side? Or are there other businesses that are contributing to the lower outlook there?
Brian D. Jellison: Well, the research side of the business is what -- they had expected some improvement in Japan, some general improvement. We're not seeing any of that. And so we just don't think we can include it in our thinking. It could happen. When we look at that midpoint guidance coming down $0.06, it's really about 1/2 or a little more, 1/2 to 2/3, for Zetec. And it's the other 1/2 is sort of the imaging thing. We do have some OEM people on inventories that are not taking anything at all. So that whole industry seems to be really tepid. And there are a few products that get shipped into people that are using the imaging technology for transportation. And that business is certainly not robust, I would say.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Got it. And then you've given a good explanation about the Hansen valve replacement process. And just a couple of quick follow-ups here. What would be the timing for -- that you'd expect to complete the replacement? And is there any provision for liabilities? Have there been any damages other than just the replacement process?
Brian D. Jellison: Yes. There's sort of 2 different things going on. I mean, this is really beyond our normal warranty kind of thing that we wouldn't really even have to do what we're doing. But these are refrigeration valves that are supplemental point of safety applications in these plants in which they are. And there are various things that could happen. And this is one of those things that -- what happened is the vendor put on a transparent finish on these things, some of which is okay, many -- some of which is not okay and are eroding faster. So in our own testing in life cycle testing, we've seen some things that we didn't really like in June and finally, have gotten to the bottom of it. So in order to encourage people to make a replacement, we're covering some of their installation labor and giving them a new product if they send us back proof that they've made the change-out. So that portion of that, no matter how we end up with the vendor, we got reimbursed for the whole $9 million. It's still a charge we -- I mean, we're going to incur that charge. So our obligation, in our opinion, was to take care of the customer and the dealer network, and then secondly, take the charge. If we get all of it back or some of it back, we'd exclude it from our earnings performance anyway, which is why we think it's a one-time item. Now as far as the liability, we have deep liability protection if something were to happen. But this is -- it doesn't come to the insurance clause because it's really a product defect. No one's been hurt or injured. There's no difficulty. If you saw this valve, it's a casting. It's a pretty decent thing, maybe some of them the size of a bowling ball. And you've got this $2 part inside it, which if you don't change it out, 4 or 5 years from now -- they normally do, but it might not last for 4 or 5 years. It's something that we're just not comfortable with.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes. That explanation is pretty clear, appreciate that. Just one last quick one for me. For MHA, what's the impact on gross margin for the segment? And on a go-forward basis, how much is MHA contributing on the gross margin line?
John Humphrey: I mean, I didn't -- it is clearly helping -- I don't have the exact contribution amount for MHA separate from the rest of it. At both Sunquest and MHA come in with -- because the way their business model operates, as well as because the value they provide to customers, both of them come in at north of 75% gross margins because all of the value they're providing is really in the operating expense side with the technology and the customer support model, the contracting arm, all of the software developers in those 2 businesses. So on a gross margin basis, they come in pretty high. Obviously, on an EBITDA margin, they're also above the company average as well. But, Deane, I'd have to get back to you with the specifics on how much MHA helps. But I know that even excluding MHA, we had gross margin expansion in the segment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Wondering what kind of the sensitivity is to the low end of the guidance. It seems like you're hedging some inopportune circumstances there perhaps.
John Humphrey: Chris, I've got to say, I'm not quite sure I understand the question. I mean, we always try to do our best to provide an outlook for the rest of the year that we think is balanced and balanced between both risks and opportunities that we see across the portfolio of businesses. And that's kind of where we've come out with respect to taking a look at our guidance of $5.72 to $5.86. We think it's pretty well-balanced on both the plus and the minus.
Brian D. Jellison: Chris, if you just look at it, it was $5.76. We took it at $5.72, so it's $0.04. And there's $0.06 or $0.07 in these 2 items, which were unknown at the time of previous guidance, which would be Zetec and the situation with the life science research. So we've actually increased the low and net of those 2 negatives. So I don't really see -- I don't see the point frankly.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on the -- I'm just wondering what the pro forma leverage is and if there's room to negotiate a more liberal covenant, given the scale of the business now.
John Humphrey: Well, so our covenant on the -- on our credit facility on a leverage basis, debt to EBITDA is 3.5x. And given our commitment to and desire to stay an investment-grade company, I don't see that 3.5x as being a constraint for us at this point. I mean, we're comfortable where we are. We'd be comfortable going up to 3x. And based upon the quality of whatever acquisition, we'd probably be able to spike above that without touching or getting close to the covenant items. I mean, this is a credit facility that, at $1.5 billion, is providing us with an awful lot of liquidity and allows us to have conversations to never have a financing contingency and those things. So it's a real powerful tool for us and frankly, it's not one that we're looking to redo. When it comes due in another 3 or 4 years, we'll take a fresh look at that.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
Ryan Edelman - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: It's actually Ryan sitting in for Jeff this morning. Just a quick question, maybe a follow-up to a comment made during -- Brian, during your pitch. You mentioned being positioned for another $1 billion worth of deals by early '14, I believe is what you said. Can you maybe just flesh that out a little bit more, talk about maybe whether it's one large one, a couple smaller ones, maybe just a little more detail there?
Brian D. Jellison: Well, we always prefer 1 large deal, 1 is easier than 2; 2 are easier than 3. And if we had our druthers, we'd do a $1 billion a year or $1 billion and another one for $200 million or $300 million. So it's an easy thing for us to do. There a lot of opportunities that are in that space. We tend -- we performed at such high gross margins and EBITDA performance, things we buy are always worth a lot of money. They don't carry massive revenue or massive fixed assets that other people buy. But we just like the idea of a larger transaction. I think when you get a Sunquest or an MHA, just like years ago when we acquired the TransCore and Neptune, you get exceptional, high-quality management. They're career-oriented people. They've got lots of succession people lined up. They're just far less risky than guys that are buying -- if you said, "Let's buy 10 $100 million bolt-ons that I could save a turn of EBITDA," I'll leave other people with that strategy. That's not our strategy. We want to buy and help people grow and use our tools to asset -- drive down their assets and reallocate their investment strategies. And that's what they do so well. So nothing's changing in that respect.
Ryan Edelman - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. I guess, what I was getting at was, is there anything in the pipeline as you see it now that we should think about one way versus the other?
Brian D. Jellison: I don't think so. But there are certainly things in the pipeline. I mean, you'd have a rare month here, where we weren't actively engaged in a transaction with somebody.
Ryan Edelman - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up, wondering if you could give us a little bit more color about a couple businesses, mainly, what else is going on outside of the Florida tag slowdown in RF, and then maybe a little bit more color on the Neptune business in general.
John Humphrey: I mean, the toll and traffic business continues to do very well for us. They have a very strong backlog with a couple of key project wins in Houston and also Harris County, which is also like Houston. So replacing and upgrading an awful lot of their in-lane equipment. So that's a project that we won earlier this year that we'll probably roll out over the next 3 or 4 years. And then the Florida tag upgrade project, which is important not only because of what we're able to do for Florida, but it also, once again, demonstrates the ability that TransCore has in almost a unique fashion to be able to have customers migrate from older technology to newer technology in a very seamless way. We have multiple protocols as technology has evolved. And so the, if you will, the language that those tags and readers speak has improved over time. And so we have the unique ability to have a multiprotocol reader, which allows them to have older hard case tags, as well as the newer sticker tags and a couple of other versions of those in one, single, seamless operating environment. And so that's the important technology for Florida but also for other areas that might look to be able to move up the technology curve as well. So I mean -- so those things are going extremely well. The Virginia ITS project is underway and will start to help out in the second half, as well as into the first half of next year. So we see a lot of positive things that are on the horizon for the toll and traffic business.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Looking at Neptune, you noted that housing starts are a gain there. I assume those replacement of installed base is using a much bigger component versus new housing starts. Where are you at right now with Neptune? What are your expectations as far as the replacement cycle?
Brian D. Jellison: Well, Neptune has done really well if they didn't have those -- you can't give us any forgiveness for losing one customer. But without that, Neptune was up over 10% in the second quarter. So we're tracking to very, very, very solid performance of Neptune. And we expect that they're going to perform well in the second half of the year once we get rid of this sort of measurement [ph] transition with that customer. So I think that's fine. The housing starts, we have such a big share of water meters in North America. I mean, if you have 30%, 40% share and you [indiscernible] the housing starts, where are those starts? Most of them are not in Bergen County [ph] . Most of these housing starts are in the south and the Southeast or the far west, we're very important. Anytime you're digging water meter pits, we have a very high share of that market. And that's what new construction looks like in most of the world when you're at or below the cost line. So it doesn't take much in the way those to help a lot. Now the other thing that happens is if you have an increase in housing starts, the normalized activity for replacement sometimes because of labor shortages and the municipal water facilities gets postponed a little bit while they're doing the activity around the new starts. So the 2 -- it's not necessarily one is unrelated to the other a little bit. But net-net, if you were to ask us if it would've been up 10% Neptune, excluding the customer loss in the second quarter, we would've probably said, "Well, it'd be difficult, but we achieved it."
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: And you're still expecting a strong tailwind in the back half obviously?
Brian D. Jellison: Absolutely, we are.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then moving on to your oil and gas exposure. Is most of that share gains? Or can you discuss that a little bit? You seem to be doing better than underlying -- of other component suppliers in oil and gas. Is that...
Brian D. Jellison: Yes, there's a couple -- so our Roper Pump business, which actually reports in industrial and non-energy, has become largely an energy business frankly. That business has directional drilling products, which are a best-of-class in certain kinds of applications. And we're starting a new facility in Texas to take advantage of larger-diameter drilling mechanisms that we have developed. And we have a very special heat-resistant operation, which is unique. And really vendors are anxious to get us up and moving so they could shift over to those products. So that's driven a good deal of growth in Roper Pump. But the rest of oil and gas is really the refinery businesses which are back making instrumentation acquisitions. And then our Compressor Control business, which is at heart of pipeline technology for feeds and speeds around turbine compressor. And that business is doing well and continues to do well. So there's sort of no negatives for us in the oil and gas arena. And then we consider Zetec and our other sensor businesses in energy to be really industrial and more industrial. And by the way, just as an additional thing, Matt, you had asked about Zetec. Well, we've got 21 people, which was 8% of the workforce here this month.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Brian, could you just talk for a second or 2 about Sunquest, maybe what the core growth looked like there? I know it's not included yet, but what the core growth look like there. You commented that by the fourth quarter, it should accelerate somewhat meaningfully. And I just was wondering how the -- or what an update would be on their ability to deliver kind of next-gen software.
John Humphrey: So it's not just next-gen software, it's really upgrades and additional applications to the installed base. So that's what is happening. So -- and particularly, as hospitals look to utilize the software in the lab in order to be able to comply with meaningful use regulations, the existing sets of customers have been able to meet the first level of meaningful use with existing Sunquest software suite. And then there are additional applications that are necessary to demonstrate meaningful use into 2014. It's those upgrades that have created a sizable, a very nice backlog of activity for Sunquest. And they are ramping up their delivery capability against what's a much larger set of net new orders or additional applications than what they've ever experienced in the past. So from a revenue basis, it's always a little bit, I think, questionable to compare against pre-acquisition times because you're never quite sure everything that was in there. Even with the amount of diligence that we've done, it's not subject to SEC reporting and all the other things associated with that. But we see the revenue on a pro forma basis up kind of in the low to mid-single-digits. But we expect that to be better in the fourth quarter as they continue to execute against the sizable backlog. And it's not until the fourth quarter when Sunquest will turn organic from a reporting standpoint because we do wait until we have a full quarter to compare against under our ownership.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then just a second question or follow-up. On the M&A pipeline, Brian, is the pipeline still heavily slanted towards software-type businesses? And also is that again slanted towards the medical side of the business? Or are there opportunities in the other platforms that are equally as attractive?
Brian D. Jellison: Well, we've looked at a number of things, Richard, that we thought were pretty attractive and are in the energy arena. And they, for the most part, either have a high degree of embedded software or firmware in the product or they, in fact, are software companies. And there's 2 that we had recent discussions with that we like. But just we don't think they're really quite right in their kind of development life, if you will. We think they've got some work they need to complete. And if they get that done, well, we'd be really happy to circle back with them. And so those are things that might happen. There are a large number of people that tend to be in the -- remember, the sort of cash register world we live in around CBORD and Horizon and some other people that are collecting information that people use for invoice and processing. So there are businesses like that, that we look at and talk about frequently. Certainly, MHA has opened up an opportunity to look at some other businesses that are complementary to those businesses in senior care and just a number of different things that are going on there. People know that we're -- we just invested nearly $2.5 billion at Sunquest and MHA, so the investment banking community tends to just deluge you with things that are similar to that. And they certainly have done that. We haven't found any of those yet to be very compelling and we have other conversations that we like that are more directly related to our existing businesses around bolt-ons. And we have the luxury of generating cash in a hurry and we're always going to do a great thing as opposed to just doing something to have activity. So that's kind of where it is.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: What was the organic orders rate? I think it was -- the revenues, it was about a 10% contribution from deals. What was that in the orders number?
John Humphrey: So on an orders basis, organic orders in the second quarter were down 2%.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then what's the third quarter organic -- what should we kind of expect for the third quarter organic growth? What's embedded in that EPS assumption?
Brian D. Jellison: Understand the second quarter is that idea that they're down 2%, when 1/3 of TransCore came in, in the second quarter last year is not a normalized number.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. So x that, what would order have been?
John Humphrey: Probably must have been flat.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then for the third quarter, what should we expect from an organic perspective? I'm just trying to understand the sequencing of the second half.
Brian D. Jellison: Well, I think we said that we expect revenue to be in the 5% to probably 6% in Q3 and somewhere between 6% and 9% in Q4.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then what -- Perfect. Okay. And then one last question, just a housekeeping item. On the deferred revenue, it was up nicely sequentially. How much was MHA, how much did that contribute?
John Humphrey: MHA does not actually have very much deferred revenue at all. So most of the deferred -- in fact, the deferred revenue growth that you see in the second quarter is annual renewals at our CBORD and Horizon businesses, as well as additions at Sunquest. It really does not apply with MHA.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So that's a pretty positive move there, right?
John Humphrey: It is. Yes. So a, it's a positive move. And it's also a little seasonal with respect to when the renewal period happens for college and university customers. Those renewals generally happen in the second quarter due to their fiscal year and the way they roll out new projects. Even without that though, it's still a nice increase for us.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. That's terrific color. Just one last question. I guess, the segment that I just want a little more detail on would be energy. I guess, Compressor Controls is obviously going to be up. Your orders were up kind of low single-digits. There's a headwind from Zetec. It looks like around 3% there, $10 million year-over-year. In the second half, are we talking about -- are we -- we're talking about growth there, obviously. Is it that kind of low single-digit, just below the average of the company for the second half in energy?
John Humphrey: I would say that for the segment in total, it will be about similar to what the total company will be in the second half from an organic basis. True, the drag on Zetec will hurt that, but the oil and gas portion of that segment is actually growing faster than the company. So net-net, it's kind of in line. So as we look across the 4 segments for the second half, we see more of the organic side coming from RF, less of the organic coming from industrial because we do still have a little bit of the headwind, although it does go away by the time we get to fourth quarter with that customer loss. And then the rest of it kind of in the range.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Quealy of Canaccord Genuity.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: Can you talk about on Industrial Technology the impact to margins on the Neptune headwind, either Q2 or rest of year?
John Humphrey: From a margin perspective, it's de minimis. They're all about the same type of margin profile. The only time when we have a little bit of margin movement, if you will, is when, for example, on our Toronto project, where we're not only providing the meters and technology but also doing the installation services. So that's something unique to the Neptune business in Canada. And the installation services, which is the labor force and temporary labor that we're able to bring on for in order to do the installs themselves, that labor portion doesn't have the same type of technology and other things that we have embedded in the meter. And so it comes at a slightly lower margin. But other than that, all the meters are generally similar in terms of margin profile.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: Okay, great. And in terms of my follow-up, tolls and traffic, you talked about good visibility with Houston and the Florida migration now, I guess, Q4 into year. But can you talk about refilling the backlog in terms of the pipeline of projects? How do you characterize that environment?
Brian D. Jellison: Well, those things, and when you get orders are always really very, very lumpy. So we're involved in a number of big projects. We've got a good deal of new activity that we're looking at in Dubai. We have new activity in some other portions of the Emirates. We have additional activity we're working on in Puerto Rico. And then we have substantial activity here in the U.S. that we're working on. We've really beefed up our regional sales organization so that we're getting much more direct customer focus than we frankly have had in the past. We've got considerable amount of management talent. And those guys are very, very bullish about what they think will happen in 2014 and 2015, so they would expect record performance off of these various projects. And then the profitability is -- sort of circles around what the mix of the business is because the reader technology and the tags, of course, are higher-margin than the service business, but the service business has higher total revenue. So while we wouldn't establish guidance yet for 2014, we would expect for our ITS and Amtech businesses to have growth that could well be above the company projection for 2014. And I think, John, with that, we're 9:30.
John Humphrey: That is correct. Yes. We've actually reached the end of our allotted time. So I think that we're all set at this point. Kyle, can you wrap it up?
Operator: That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return it back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Okay. So once again, thank you, all, for joining us. And we look forward to talking to you again in 3 months as we complete our third quarter.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you, all, for your participation.

Operator: The Roper Industries First Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. I will now turn the conference over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Kayla, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our first quarter. Joining me this morning is: Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Jason Conley, who heads up Planning and Investor Relations. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. In addition, we have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com. Now if you turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. Now if you'll please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter primarily on a non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation and on our website. For the first quarter, the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is a fair value adjustment to acquired deferred revenue at Sunquest. For the quarter, this impact was $3.6 million to revenue and operating profit. This adjustment represents revenue that, absent our acquisition, Sunquest would have recognized. We believe showing our results on this basis provides additional insight into the ongoing and recurring results of the business. And now if you'll please turn to Slide 3, I will turn -- sorry, to Slide 4, I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian D. Jellison: Thank you, John, and good morning, everybody. If we look at the Q1 enterprise financial results, it was an all-time record for the first quarter, most level of orders, highest level of sales, biggest net earnings, the most EBITDA and the highest operating and free cash flow. One of the incredible things about the first quarter is that all of our margins again increased, gross margins, the operating margin, the EBITDA margin and the net earning margins, all established records for Roper. Our orders at $794 million are particularly strong in that last year we had about $15 million out of the Neptune cancellation, which of course, didn't recur, making that $794 million look even stronger on a comparative basis. Revenue was $741 million and our book-to-bill was 1.07, which is well above our norm. We have a little over $1 billion in backlog now, which is up 18% over last year at this time. Our gross margin went up 240 basis points to 57.4%. And all 4 segments actually increased their gross margin, so it's not just the benefit of higher margin of Sunquest but execution in all 4 segments. Operating margins were up 150 basis points to 25.5%. And our EBITDA reached $230 million in the quarter, which was up 210 basis points to 31%, which is a quite excellent performance for our first quarter. Our GAAP operating cash flow was $171 million, representing 23% of revenue. Compare that $171 million to $125 million of net earnings. The free cash flow was $160 million in the first quarter and our diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $1.27. We felt we had really compelling margins and cash flow, and then the Q1 orders will really drive our full year organic growth. Next slide. Here, we look at the Q1 income statement. Couple of things here. In the orders, you can see overall orders for the company were up 9%, organic was up 1%. But if you adjust for the $15 million Neptune cancellation, that contract cancellation, organic would have been up 3%, which may explain our tone about feeling better about orders and organic growth for the balance of the year. Revenue, which was at $741 million, was up 4%; organic, posted down 3%, but most all of that is this Neptune cancellation, again it's over 2%. And the residual was just the continuing softness in the imaging businesses that we expected. So the core really was flat to modest growth on revenue without those 2 particular items. Gross margin, as we said before, up 240 basis points to 57.4% from 55% last year with each segment increasing their margins. Operating profit was up by $19 million on a $3 million [ph] revenue variance, so our leverage was above 60%. And that included greater than $1 million charge in deal costs we incurred in the quarter but aren't calling out as a separate item for a one-timer. Operating margin, you can see, was up 150 basis points from 24% to 25.5%. Interest was up 6%, as we're paying for the interest related to the new bond offering last year and the interest costs for Sunquest. Other expenses, we had a negative experience at $2.5 million, mostly FX-driven item here. So that $2.5 million plus the $1 million on the deal cost was about a $3.5 million drag. Fortunately, we had a benefit from our tax rate, with about half of that coming from the R&D and other extenders from 2012. And that gave us the net earnings of $1.27. Next slide. If you look at the EBITDA growth, 2 years ago, our trailing EBITDA at the end of the first quarter was $685 million. Last year, it was $830 million. And this year, we're already up to $950 million on a trailing basis. No pro forma in that, that's just the number. So we're up $265 million in just 2 years. And then if you look at our margin performance on EBITDA, 2 years ago, it was 27.4% on a trailing 12-month basis. Last year, it was 29%. And this year, it closes out at 31.3% and will continue to expand, up 390 basis points in just 2 years. So it's really extraordinary performance on an EBITDA and margin basis by any measure. Next slide. Our Q1 cash flow, it's again remarkable and it continues to grow as a function of revenue. We had $171 million of operating cash flow. If you divide that by the net earnings, you can see the conversion was 137%. We had $160 million in free cash flow, which is 22% of revenue. And the cash conversion is at 128%. It's really across-the-board improvement in every segment, certainly a record. You can see our cash flow -- free cash flow in the quarter at $160 million is twice what it was 2 years ago at $78 million. And below, you can see the percent of revenue. As I said, cash flow as a function of revenue continues to escalate. 2 years ago, it was 12.1%; a year ago, 18.5%; and this year, 21.7%. Next slide. We'll get into the individual details, a lot of moving parts here. So let's turn to the first one, which is Energy Systems & Controls. I think these are kind of in order of revenue or orders, so energy system being our smallest segment now at 20%. Here, you had orders up modestly about $4 million, revenue down a little bit and gross margin increased from 54.1% to 55.6%, up 150 basis points. On the items in the quarter, our compressor controls business continues to capture growth. They're benefiting from global project rollouts that had a lot of visibility, too, for the balance of the year and continued to increase their field engineering billable time for people. Next point is that the lower gas rig count reduced revenue for our engine safety systems businesses and some other people that are in that category. That was about a $3 million drag in the quarter. And the industrial end markets were soft as it related to any instruments and pretty good on consumables. That was another $2 million drag. Margin expansion from the growth in the higher-margin areas and benefits from second half 2012 cost actions helped us out. And you can see the book-to-bill for the segment was 1.08, which is quite strong. In the second quarter, we would expect relatively flat revenue in the energy systems business but higher margins. And then in the second half of the year, we see higher revenue growth with compressor controls really driving a big part of that, and then more favorable comps for some of the other energy categories. And we're getting -- starting to see what will be a ramping early adoption of some new products around sensor technology that we're introducing in control systems. Next slide. Here, we'll look at Industrial Technology. While revenue was down, virtually the whole variance is simply the Neptune contract cancellation. That was $15 million and revenue was down about $13 million. So we had flattish revenue exclusive of that. We had very strong growth in our U.S. water meter sales, which was better than expected, that double-digit growth in water meter sales. And that really offset the drag we had in our material analysis business, where we had instrument sales decline somewhat with consumables being steady. But net-net, the contract cancellation wasn't able -- we weren't able to overcome that with other organic growth. The fluid handling, we had growth in certain niche markets that mitigated the gas drilling activity. The gas drilling activity did hurt our Cornell Pump business a little bit, but the other businesses were strong. Book-to-bill was virtually flat at 0.99. Gross margins expanded in the industrial segment even without the revenue growth. They went from 50.6% up to 51.2%, so a 60 basis point increase. And those very few businesses that delevered did so at a very modest leverage rate. For the second quarter, we would expect similar market conditions, although we will get sequential growth from the first quarter. We still have the Neptune headwind for another quarter. It was $15 million in Q1. It's going to be about $12 million in Q2. As we get into the second half, that dissipates. So we're back on a normal basis. And you'll see better-looking ratio numbers on the growth pattern. Fluid handling growth in directional drilling is assured. We've got strong incoming orders and demand for products in that arena. And the energy markets are improving very modestly. Our material analysis comps are going to be relatively easy for us to lap, so we expect to do better there. And the Neptune headwind in the second half, it eases to a single-digit number in Q3, and then 0 in Q4. So that will help us. And our distributor network around water meter sales is continuing to grow as housing continues stronger than it was in the past. Next slide. If we look at the RF Technology segment, very strong performance here, orders are up $36 million. We had great segment orders, led by toll and traffic, where segment orders were up 18% over the prior year. Two really important projects that we'll have delivery throughout the year but kind of tailored to the end of the year with the Florida Department of Transportation tag upgrade project, and then Virginia's I-66 highway system. We had revenue growth in toll and traffic projects in the first quarter, which offset lower tag shipments, which were lower than a year ago. And project execution, as we've made some considerable upgrades in the people side at TransCore, certainly paying dividends as we see better operational performance. In fact, the segment overall gross margins went up from 51.8% last year to 53.9% this year, so they're up 210 basis points. We had some growth again in our freight match and iTrade U.S. businesses on subscriber subscriptions. And our book-to-bill, you can see, is exceptionally strong at 1.15. For the remainder of the year, we see this backlog really positioning us for an assured amount of organic growth in toll and traffic. And then our CBORD cashless systems and integrated security wins, which we're confident about, will also drive growth. We've just won in April a Technolog contract award for gas AMR. This is going to be in the U.K. It will drive improved second half performance for us. It's a 5-year contract and the terms aren't ready to be disclosed. But it will certainly add to our growth profile in the second half of the year. And then our Inovonics brand businesses, who make wireless sensors for security and senior care and submetering, are doing dramatically better this year. There were better in the first quarter. And we expect them to be substantially better in the latter part of the year, particularly in our senior care applications and submetering as multifamily housing continues to strengthen. And we'll get some continued modest growth in our subscriber bases in our SaaS businesses at the freight matching and iTrade. Next slide. If we look at Medical & Scientific Imaging, a huge increase in orders, up $59 million. And of course, some of that is Sunquest. Nonetheless, revenue was up 25% over the prior year and operating profit is up 46% over the prior year. And operating margins, on what used to be our most difficult segment, from an OP viewpoint, are up 450 basis points to 31.1%. And our gross margins in the quarter increased by 270 basis points over last year. So we look at the specific items. Sunquest is on plan. They have favorable order rates, so they're ahead on orders. We do need to increase our ability to get faster implementation processes in place, which we've been talking to them about. Because we have an opportunity to increase our growth beyond their original expectations if we can get the implementation processes to happen faster. We continue to have very weak research markets. And those continue to negatively impact us. In fact, in the quarter, that was a $12 million headwind, and it's hard to make that up. We had a very difficult comp at Gatan because they had kind of a blowout first quarter last year. But the core problem remains very modest activity in the camera borses [ph] with the research funding around the world. Medical devices were a little bit soft as it related to direct sales to U.S. hospitals, but consumable sales were quite good. So on balance, that came out fine. Our book-to-bill for the segment was 1.06. In the second half of the year, medical is going to be led by this faster uptick on the Sunquest implementation execution. It's the only thing that wouldn't be driving greater growth. And so we're very focused on seeing that improve. It's not bad, it's just that it could be better because we're getting a lot of new business on the adoption of software upgrades for Sunquest. And the speed at which we can recognize that revenue is directly related to our execution capability and the implementation. We had strength -- in the second half, we're going to have strength in CIVCO's applications. Remember, that's a multimodality business. In radiation oncology, we have some new products that are coming to play, so they'll add some growth in the second half. And while the research markets remain challenging, they have easier comps for scientific imaging in the second half than they did in the first half. And then the MHA acquisition will add substantially to our growth. And I've asked John Humphrey to talk through the nature of MHA, and then I'll talk a bit about why we thought it was a great acquisition. So John?
John Humphrey: Thank you, Brian. Next slide, going to the MHA overview slide. So talk a little bit about this acquisition, which we do expect to close later in the week. So all the regulatory approval has already been obtained on that. So MHA is the largest provider of services and technology and a network for the alternate site health care markets. An alternate site, for those of you on the phone, just means nonhospital settings. So all the places where care is being delivered in a nonacute care, nonhospital type of setting. What they really provide is a whole suite of tools and technologies, which include GPO services, includes reimbursement tools, software specific to pharmacy solutions and the largest network for processing and adjudicating Medicare Part D claims, and they provide that for all of their customers across multiple classes of trade. And those are delivered with the largest and most comprehensive customer service team, which enables their customers to both increase revenue through getting better reimbursements and faster reimbursements and also to lower costs by being able to purchase more effectively and efficiently across the network that MHA is able to provide to them. They do have the #1 position in all of their served niche markets, which include long-term care pharmacists, home infusion, specialty pharmacy, assisted living locations, all of the places where care is being delivered in a nonhospital setting. Next slide. Going into a few more of the kind of facts and figures for MHA. When we talk about it being the largest alternate site health care network, this really gives a glimpse of the scale that MHA has with a customer base of about 12,000 different customers, 47,000 different locations. And they enable the purchasing volume for all of those current locations, which exceeds $5 billion annually. And MHA is able to have a share in that, and that's how they're able to generate revenue. And as I said, they do process almost 35% of all Medicare Part D claims in the country with the network that they're providing for their customers. Over 120 million annual pharmacy and drug interactions that are being analyzed and delivered and the large customer service workforce. And that workforce is more than just sales people. They really act as consultants that enables their customer success, so they're able to run the business more effectively. And that high degree of customer intimacy is one of the sustainable real advantages that MHA has in the marketplace. On the right side, you can see the breakdown of the customers and the end markets that they're serving. About half of their customers are in long-term care pharmacy. The long-term care facility, that also includes assisted living centers. And that's generally around food that's being purchased but also other things in those long-term care facilities. The alternate site care includes such thing as specialty pharmacy, home infusion, respiratory therapy, et cetera. And then that other smaller slice that says technology is really the network and the other software and enabling tools that MHA is providing to its customers that allows them to run their business more effectively. Now the end market that we see here has a number of very durable and diverse growth drivers, including favorable demographic trends. Except for the people on the phone, everyone else in the country is getting a little older. And these alternate site care markets are in low-cost care setting. So as more care is being delivered outside of the hospital setting, that's a favorable trend that's impacting this end market. And we continue to expect to see market share gains based upon the value, the scale that MHA has in the classes of trade that they serve and the strong customer service, high intimacy consulting type of sales process that they have. And this niche market still provides what we think are very complementary acquisition opportunities. MHA has done a few of those in their history, and we would expect to continue that process as we go forward. So there's a couple of slides about MHA, who they are, who they serve and what they provide. And I'll turn it back over to Brian to talk a little bit about the acquisition and how it fits.
Brian D. Jellison: Thanks, John. People always ask us about what our criteria for acquisitions are. And we -- virtually every presentation, we will tell you that these are the things that we're looking at. And just as a reminder, these are the things we look at. So if you look at the first item, we want our businesses to be asset-light. Many people report EBITDA, and they don't even take the time to tell you what the EBITDA minus CapEx is. And they'll talk about depreciation and CapEx as though it's unimportant. We think asset velocity is extremely important. So in the case of MHA, they have no inventory. That would be 0, nada. And they have negative working capital. So the cash-on-cash growth out of MHA is really quite substantial because it's going to throw off additional cash that we're going to be able to use to acquire companies to augment its own growth. We're going to -- we always want to focus on market structure and driving forces. We invested more money and diligence on MHA than any deal we've ever had, with 3 different outside people approaching this from very different directions. And we've been looking at this company for quite a long time, waiting to pull the trigger based on a variety of factors. And this research was critically important to us to just see how secure their strategy is and that there aren't externalities that could come out of the woodwork that would be difficult for us. On customer intimacy and technology, we want those to drive the purchase decision, and we were very impressed. When John talks about the consulting nature, these people virtually prepare for their clients a 3-ring binder that they go through to kind of tell them how they're performing and where they can make decisions that will add to their margins. And these guys that they're serving work on such slim margins that a basis point change could be the difference between whether they're cash-positive or cash-negative. Management continuity we always value. And in this case, the entire team is coming along. Mike Sicilian is going to run this business. I and his team are on board. In fact, as we say, we like to have incentives linked to commitments from the team. And in this case, we have a 3-year forward execution goals in place already with Mike's team. We like to still focus on the cubby [ph] idea of preserving core values and stimulating progress. And in this case, the core values at MHA are really outstanding. They have great people and they provide great service. But we're going to be able to get them access to customers and complementary people that we currently do business with in our software activity, both in RF and in medical, which should be quite helpful to Mike as he continues to grow his business. And then grow what you buy. Well, one of the immediate benefits you get from our ownership is that MHA customers can have much better confidence now because they have a strong company behind it instead of it being a private equity situation. Customers don't have to worry about who might own it in the future and whether that's in or not in their best interest. And they can really focus now on executing long-range strategies, knowing that they have a permanent home. And they really are, both from a cultural viewpoint and end market viewpoint, a great addition to our medical family. Next slide. So here, we take a look at the 2013 guidance. Next slide. The full year non-GAAP DEPS guidance we're increasing from $5.60 on the low range to $5.76 and from $5.82 on the top to $5.94. That really comes about -- we have $0.05 of negative currency using our 3/31 currency versus what we said at 12/31. So that's a negative $0.05. And then we have a positive $0.14 on the low end for MHA and a positive $0.17 on the high end. We raised the low end higher because really the quality of our orders and delivery gives us very little doubt about the low end compared to where we were at the beginning of the year when we had the $5.60. Tax rate for the rest of the year, unfortunately, it's going to be in this 31% category. MHA is a high tax base business as is Sunquest. Both those continue to grow, and they add several basis points to our tax rate. Sales guidance, we said at the beginning of the year, we thought we could do somewhere between 8% and 10% of revenue with about 5% of that coming from Sunquest, meaning about 3% to 5% in organic. And we don't see any reason we can't still do the 3% to 5% organic. So we're raising our sales guidance to 11% to 13% for the year, with some of that coming from MHA. And I think that's -- should really -- we're just quite comfortable with those numbers despite a little softness in the first quarter. And I think if you look at the numbers without remembering that you had a $15 million divot from the contract cancellation in the first quarter and a $12 million divot in the second, you might think it's softer than it is. Q2 non-GAAP DEPS is going to be $1.26 to $1.30. The only way that would improve is if some of these projects for the second half moved into the second quarter. But we don't have any reason to believe they will but they could. We're going to have a much stronger Q3 and Q4. A little bit more EPS coming in the second half of the year from a linearity viewpoint than normal, but that's due to the nature of the things that have happened in the first half of the year in our acquisitions. For our full year, the GAAP operating cash flow, we've raised the guidance to exceed $800 million. And that's fairly prestigious cash flow, we would say. And then we are reminding people in our press release in here that all of the MHA items will be non-GAAP. Next slide. Here, if we look at the Q1 summary then, we really have had compelling results on all the margins, the cash flow. The niche markets continued to separate Roper from any of these traditional or perceived peers that people used to talk about for Roper. For us, it's always frustrating. Some guy, "It's a machinery company." My goodness, it's certainly not a machinery company, it's an selectable products company. We don't have a single business that's in the NAICS [ph] code electrical products. I mean, this is a diversified growth company getting more diversified with each acquisition, with the biggest piece of our activity now centered around medical and radio frequency and software technologies. We've achieved record first quarter results in all of these different categories. Our book-to-bill was 1.07 with a backlog up 18% to $1 billion. Our gross margin, as we said, was up 240 basis points to 57.4% and all 4 segments were up. Operating margin, up 150 basis points; EBITDA, up 210 basis points to $230 million; and operating cash flow coming in at 23% of revenue; and free cash flow at 22% of revenue with 128% cash conversion. MHA will close this week. With any luck, it will close on May 1. And we're really now positioned to capture organic growth for the rest of the year. And with that, we'd like to open it up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Deane Dray with Citi.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: For MHA, maybe some additional color on their mix, some sense of how or what percent of their contracts are exclusive. And maybe talk a bit about how much of the revenue comes from performance contracts and how they've done against those historically.
John Humphrey: Yes. So none of their contracts are performance-based. Most of the things you're talking about, this idea of exclusivity is more of acute care hospital type of GPO -- I mean, very little as far as MHA's contracts with their customers are exclusive and none of them are performance-based.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then Brian, I was hoping you can expand on -- and maybe this is just the terminology. But on Sunquest, when you talked about you're looking for faster implementation, is this -- are you talking about integration, new software rollouts? Or just if you could expand on that point.
Brian D. Jellison: Yes. The integration is fine. It's just a world-class organization, and we've had nothing but a marvelous time working with the Sunquest people. But the adoption of the software upgrades that they're getting is occurring at a faster pace, I think, than they expected. And as a result, their ability to execute against those and get the implementation needs to improve. And they're making some structural changes around people and who's driving what so that they can get better focus on that because we could actually escalate their growth if we can get out there to get those new customers onboard. It's a customer integration, not a Roper to Sunquest integration question.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And just to clarify on that, what is the growth rate that you're expecting from Sunquest if you factor in these new software upgrades?
Brian D. Jellison: I think we're expecting it to grow at sort of high single-digits.
Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And what type of margins that you've been -- you're getting out of the blocks?
Brian D. Jellison: I'd say they're maybe twice ours.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: One follow-up on MHA, and then I have another question. John or Brian, can you talk about the addressable market size for MHA, the competitive environment, whether you see any disruptive technologies out there to what MHA has?
John Humphrey: We see a lot of disruptive technologies and saw them all during our diligence process. I mean, they have a very high share, and particularly in the long-term care pharmacy space, yes, well north of 50% there. But it's still -- they have the largest share also in the long-term care facilities around food purchasing, but that's a relatively small share. So there's still quite a bit of headroom to grow in the long-term care facility and assisted living areas. And then we just see the positive drivers associated with demographic trends and more care being delivered in nonhospital settings as population ages. So those are positive benefits. And then those share gains, particularly on the LTCF side of their business, are things that we think will drive their growth going forward.
Brian D. Jellison: I think, Matt, that John means that the disruptors that he sees are at MHA, which is...
John Humphrey: Yes, that is what I meant.
Brian D. Jellison: We're seeing a pretty clear pathway of growth there. And we're enabling a lot of people to be successful in a marketplace that probably wouldn't be able to survive without the productivity that MHA allows them to deliver.
John Humphrey: That's right.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And then my for my follow-up, just, Brian, can help fill in the blanks a little bit on the organic growth forecast? You start out minus 3%. It sounds to me like you weren't specific, but the second quarter is maybe relatively flattish. That really does imply a pretty big finish to the year. Can you just sort of help bridge how Roper gets there?
John Humphrey: Sure. I mean, yes, you're right, as far as the math and the way that it rolls out. So with kind of down 3% in the first quarter, we're expecting second quarter to be up kind of in the low single-digit range on an organic basis, 1%, 2%, 3%. And then the back half is in the high single-digit range, driven by the orders that we received in the first quarter. So that provides a nice backlog and contracts and projects to execute against in the RF segment. And then just some modestly improving areas, some new product introductions, and frankly, a little bit of easier comps as we get toward Q3 and Q4 in some of the imaging and industrial segments.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Just a couple of questions, gents. Just again on MHA, is that $95 million EBITDA number inclusive of the D&A that gets created by your acquisition of the company? Or is that its own underlying EBITDA?
John Humphrey: It's actually both. So we will have incremental amortization, obviously, of the intangibles upon acquisition. But the earnings before that amortization and interest in other things is consistent between our ownership and theirs. And just to clarify that $95 million is under the first 12 months of our ownership, not for the calendar year of '13.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: So you're saying the additional DA created by your acquisition doesn't -- isn't significant relative to that $95 million number?
John Humphrey: Right. Yes. So we've got the $95 million of EBITDA. And then we're right now estimating that the amortization on an annual basis will be something around $25 million.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: And that's included in the $95 million?
John Humphrey: Right. Well, it's actually excluded from the $95 million, so the $95 million is before the amortization. So if you add any amortization, it comes down to $75 million or $70 million.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Got it. And just trying to ballpark the revenues of the business, I guess, at the midpoint of your revenue range is you've raised revenues by 3 percentage points, which is $90 million or so for a partial year. You've got some FX headwinds and other things going on. But we're talking about a business that's, I don't know, $130 million, $150 million in revenues. Is that the right ballpark?
John Humphrey: Yes. That's a fair assessment.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: And then finally, I was just wondering if you could give us a little more detail on how the deal pipeline looks now. This was obviously a very significant deal with the pipeline still active. Should we expect anything else this year of this size? Any general color would be appreciated.
Brian D. Jellison: Well, I think a couple of years ago, we said we already knew where the next $5 billion of investment would be. It's just that you never know whether you're going to close the gap or things work out. In this case, having done Sunquest at $1.4 billion in August and MHA at $1 billion this month, at $2.5 billion, we're sort of halfway there. We're hoping that things that we would like to do are still going to be available to us over the next 2 or 3 years. So I don't think there's any question. We've still got another $2.5 billion or $3 billion to go. But I don't think much of that would be this year.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.
Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just to follow up on that organic growth question from earlier, clearly the book-to-bill was strong this quarter, 1.07. What kind of confidence and visibility do you have into that back half of the year growth forecast? And then are there any specific areas where you have concerns in the back half of the year, given what you've seen and what has been a relatively slower growth environment this quarter?
John Humphrey: Yes. That's a really good question. So the areas that we have the best visibility into are the ones where we also had some of the best order growth this quarter. So in the RF segment, which has a little bit longer lead time between order receipt and revenue and project execution, so that's the area that I would say that we probably have the highest degree of confidence in, because most of what we're going to be shipping out and delivering in the back half is largely in backlog already today. And then as we kind of step away from that and see that one of the areas where we have a little bit less visibility because we're faster between order to delivery, those areas are more in our industrial and energy markets. And so we have a number of things that are going on there. Our compressor controls is very similar to RF in terms of its backlog and visibility. But some of the other areas there, it's not unusual to have a order to revenue cycle that would be measured in weeks, not months. But we do have visibility in terms of the new products that we're introducing and what we expect the uptake rate to be there. But I wouldn't say that our view on the second half, as we stand here today, is any different than our view would have been on the second half as we stood here at this time last year. So we have similar visibility today as we would at any other time as we look 6 to 9 months out. And that kind of tries to give some sense of where we have better visibility and things that still have to happen in order to achieve our earnings guidance for the year.
Brian D. Jellison: Let me just add to that, Joe, that the -- our book and ship businesses actually did quite fine. And our book and ship businesses are motoring along. What we wanted to see and we were fortunate to have it occur is that these longer lead time businesses, which really are compressor control and our toll and traffic businesses, in some cases CBORD projects, all are coming in favorably now. That's where -- there was more risk in those things for the year than there are in some of these book and ship businesses. And our bellwethers that would worry us, that would say there's some weakness -- are seeing some of that on the instrument side that's CapEx-related but not anything on the service and parts and consumable side. So we -- that's the reason we were willing to stick with the organic guidance we had here when we raised our overall sales to 11% to 13% for the year.
Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. That's helpful color, guys. I guess, one follow-up is given that we have had a little bit of a slower growth environment, has there been any adjustments that you've had to make to your portfolio, either adjusting the cost structure in any way to try to navigate through these relatively uncertain paths? Or has the portfolio essentially been -- remained intact over the past quarter or 2?
John Humphrey: Well, in terms of the portfolio meaning the businesses, they've remained intact. We haven't really done anything about exiting a category. We did a very modest amount of restructuring in the third quarter of last year and even a little less in the fourth quarter. Most of that was in the energy business, which is why energy's first quarter had higher margins and why we're seeing they'll have still higher margins again sequentially in the second quarter. Those businesses that were down, and they were only a few, the big down is just this contract cancellation that -- going through the pipeline here. And so the others aren't down all that much. Where they are down, they're deleveraging at about 30% with gross margins at 50%. So that would tell you that their costs are quite fine in terms of being in line. And since we don't have a lot of heavy assets, if we had to make an adjustment, we can be very nimble compared to most other people because most of our assets go home at night.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: So if we're talking about high single-digits in the second half, would it be fair to be thinking about RF as double-digits? Or presumably somewhere there's low double-digits in there and just wondering if we could go a little deeper into any such component.
Brian D. Jellison: Yes. It would be safe to say that RF will lead the organic growth profile by a wide margin. You'll get -- you'll struggle to get past mid-digits in industrial and you'll get high single-digits in energy and medical, and double-digits in RF.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And on the medical, high single organic can -- what's at the forefront of that? Is there any research improvement or budget flush that you're kind of putting into that?
John Humphrey: It's all relative.
Brian D. Jellison: That's true. It is just relative. The situation there is you do have easier comps for the research market businesses. But we're not expecting anything great out of those. It's just a little better. And they did have a weaker Q1. And what really happens in the medical segment is in the fourth quarter, Sunquest becomes organic. So we acquired it in August, so it's finally going to lap itself and it will drive some additional growth in that segment.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. That makes sense. And then just overall in the quarter versus where you came into it, what was the 1 or 2 biggest surprises?
Brian D. Jellison: I think even though we're down 3% organically, it's really all just this contract situation, getting rid of that. And the imaging, which we expected to be soft, I think we were generally encouraged that the consumption stuff with consumables in those businesses that were weaker with instruments was as strong as it was. So it's not suggesting that people are slowing down their activity but maybe postponing their purchases. Our stuff tends to be above MRO and below capital spending. But it's easy to defer the instrument purchases for a period of time.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Looking at -- Brian, can you say -- or John, after MHA, what does the balance sheet look like and what's your capacity after it closes?
Brian D. Jellison: You mean our balance sheet, not MHA's balance sheet?
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Yes, correct.
John Humphrey: So on a post-close basis, I mean, obviously, we'll be borrowing -- a substantial portion of our $1 billion will be borrowed under the revolver. And then that will put us kind of at a debt to EBITDA level of somewhere in the 2.5, 2.6 range, very consistent with our existing ratings and with our long-term commitment to continue to be an investment grade-rated company. So I don't really see an awful lot of pressure there. And then also you see we did raise our operating cash flow guidance for the year up to $800 million. So with the vast majority of that being in the U.S., we'll use that to pay down debt through the year and continue to build capacity with growing EBITDA to continue to do what we've been doing for the past 5, 10 years as well.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Yes. I don't doubt that. I guess, it's more -- what will be left in the revolver and how much cash will you have left?
John Humphrey: So it is a $1.5 billion revolver, and this will -- if all of this is drawn, so it'd be $1 billion. So we still have $500 million available under the revolver plus the cash that we'll generate through the year.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. So you're not drawing down your cash balance much at all, it's all in the revolver?
John Humphrey: That's a fair assessment, yes.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then looking at the medical and scientific, it looks like -- did research decline double-digits? Is that kind of what we're looking at here?
John Humphrey: That's correct.
Brian D. Jellison: If you call $12 million on its base, the answer is yes. Down double-digits last year, and they're continuing their trend.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: They were down double-digits last year as well?
Brian D. Jellison: They were. Yes.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. So then with the rest of medical outside of Sunquest, was it roughly flat? It sounds like that was certainly below...
Brian D. Jellison: All of medical is the duck on the water, right? So everything looks fine. But the feet are moving fast, so there are different product lines that are doing better than others. Anything that has consumables with it is still doing really well. Some of the product businesses are more mixed. So you've got from negative single-digits to modest growth. We've got some new products that are coming on board, so we feel on balance pretty decent about the medical device side of the business.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And finally, can you give us an idea of the size of the orders in the toll and traffic in Florida and Virginia if you can?
John Humphrey: I don't know if we can do that. Let me check. And if we have approval to give any color on the size of those contract wins, then I'll be able to get back in touch with you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just a couple of questions on MHA, a follow-up here. Can you just give us a feel for what the purchased volume that MHA has handled -- what the growth rate been there in the last, say, 3 years? And then also what percentage of MHA's revenue comes from an administrative fee on that?
John Humphrey: So the majority -- in fact, the vast majority of their revenue is an administrative fee on that purchase volume. And that purchase volume has -- there are a couple of different parts to that. You've got the long-term care pharmacy side, where the overall purchase volume has probably been flat over the past couple of years, primarily because of some branded drugs that have gone to generic, kind of that big change, particularly around one drug called SEROQUEL happened last year. So that change over the last couple of years has impacted the pharmacy side. On the long-term care facility side, where most of the purchases are around food, that's been growing at a single-digit -- a mid-single-digit rate on the overall purchase. But MHA has been growing faster than that due to share gains.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. Is there a deferred revenue component with MHA? Will there be?
John Humphrey: There will not be a deferred revenue component, no.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then just the last question. On the RF tech side of the business, given the growth in the second half will come off of some project work, primarily in tolling, would you expect that the EBIT margin for RF -- or excuse me, yes, for industrial tech -- or excuse me, for RF, will work higher on that project-driven revenue than it is in the first quarter?
John Humphrey: You mean the project-driven revenue at RF?
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Yes. So RF will be driven in the second half by these projects in Virginia. I know you have one in California, also the projects at CBORD. But will the EBIT margin in RF tech work higher in the second half? Is there leverage there? Or is the project revenue going to come in at the same general EBIT level?
Brian D. Jellison: There's 2 kinds of leverage here, right? So one, as we said, one of the reasons that we did better in the first quarter in RF is the quality of the project execution that they have, which is service-related. The second is the margin on product sold. So when you look at a particular situation, like Florida has a lot of tag sales, so the margins associated with the Florida order will be higher than the Virginia order, where the Virginia order has more labor content, which is really almost design and build, if you will. So you're not going to have huge margins there, but you do have spread variances on your execution. And I would say not long ago, we put a new President in at TransCore that's a career expert. Tracy Marks is doing an incredible job. And he's really built a very fine team. We've kind of done some structural things to get more attention on contract execution, and that's starting to pay benefits. So I think we'll see in the second half better leverage on contracts than we enjoyed in the last couple of years. But they still will be the lowest-margin businesses we have just because there's so much labor content in them that they're not high-margin businesses.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. All right. So again, off the first quarter EBIT of, say, 27% for RF tech, we'll still get some volume leverage off of that project work and that should -- our EBIT margin should work higher for the balance of the year?
John Humphrey: Time will tell. We'll be able to talk more clearly about that after we have the third and fourth quarter. But I do want to follow up on one earlier question, Rick, I'm sorry. So just to your question around deferred revenue, the answer is no. There's not really a deferred revenue component for MHA. There will be some noise with respect to how purchase accounting treats some of the revenue that MHA has. That's why our guidance is on a non-GAAP basis. We're going to be adding some of that revenue back that will not be recognized due to purchase accounting rules. And after we close on the business, we'll be able to know exactly how much that is and talk more clearly and have some additional schedules available at the second quarter close that will describe that adjustment in detail.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: Just 2 quick ones. First, on the book-to-bill, obviously, very strong in RF. I'm assuming as revenue goes up, maybe book-to-bill qualitatively goes down this year. Can you talk to that? And then the second one, within industrial tech, you talked about double-digit metering gains. Is that competitive? Or do you think that's part of the -- with Elster going away? Or do you think that's part of the market coming back in housing, et cetera?
Brian D. Jellison: From what we've heard from competitors, they didn't do very well first quarter and we did quite well. So people will have to sort out whatever they think the forces at work are. I don't know, I just know that we continue to grow with the exception of the contract cancellation and have double-digit growth in the United States in water meters.
John Humphrey: And then with your respect to your other question, John. So the book-to-bill ratio at 1.15 for the segment, I mean, that is above our norm. We would expect that over time to trend to closer to 1. And it will be based upon the timing of project orders in the RF segment as we go into the second half. Obviously, as some of these orders that we just received ship out in the third and fourth quarter, those will start to bring that ratio back down.
Operator: That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We will now return the call back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Okay. Thank you, all, for joining us, and we do look forward to talking to you at the end of the second quarter as well.
Operator: [indiscernible]

===== 2012 Q4  (2013-01-28 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Brian Jellison – Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer John Humphrey – Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Paul Soni – Vice President, Controller Jason Conley – Investor Relations
Analysts: Dean Dray – Citi Research Matt Summerville – Keybanc Mark Douglass – Longbow Research Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management 
Operator:  The Roper Industries Fourth Quarter 2012 Financial Results conference call will now begin. I will now turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. 
John Humphrey: Thank you, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our fourth quarter and full year. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller, and Jason Conley, Head of Planning and Investor Relations for us.  Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today’s call. In addition, we’ve prepared slides to accompany today’s call which are available through the webcast and also on our website at www.roperind.com. If you’ll turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today’s call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as detailed further in our SEC filings. You should listen to today’s call in the context of that information. Now if you’ll turn to Slide 3, today we’ll be discussing our income statement results for the quarter primarily on a non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is in our press release and also included as a part of this presentation on our website. To detail that, for the fourth quarter the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is a fair value adjustment to acquired deferred revenue at Sunquest. For the quarter, this impact was $6 million to revenue and operating profit. This adjustment, to remind everyone, represents revenue that absent our acquisition Sunquest would have recognized. We believe showing our results on this basis provides additional insight into the ongoing and recurring results of the business. For the full year, the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is comprised of three discrete items: one, the fair value adjustment to acquired deferred revenue; second, acquisition-related costs specific to Sunquest and the debt extinguishment charge we recorded in the third quarter. We believe discussing our results excluding these items provides investors with additional insight and improves understanding of the trends of our business. And now if you’ll please turn to Slide 4, I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we’ll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison:  Thank you, John. Good morning everyone. So as we look at the Q4 enterprise financial results, it turned out to be the best quarter in our history on virtually every measurement category. Orders were at the highest level, revenue the highest, net earnings highest, EBITDA, and both operating and free cash flow were all-time records for us. Revenue was up 10% in the quarter. Organic growth was 3%, and all four segments really participated in our record fourth quarter. We ended the year with $953 million in backlog, which is 15% higher than it was this time last year, and our gross margin was really spectacular. It came in at a remarkable 57.9% for the quarter, which really speaks to the quality of our businesses and their ability to execute. So gross margin up 300 basis points, above levels that most people never even see. Our operating margin expanded 300 basis points to 28.3% because operating leverage in the quarter came in at about 57% on new revenue. Our operating leverage throughout the year has been above 50%, and we’ll talk more about that throughout the discussion this morning. Remember that we have a lot of non-cash amortization charges in our operating margins. If you look at them on an EBITDA basis, it would be substantially higher – another 4 points. Our EBITDA in the quarter was 275 million. You might remember at the end of the third quarter we’d said we hoped to hit a run rate in the fourth quarter of a billion dollars or more, and we certainly achieved that. Our EBITDA margins were up 370 basis points, even higher expansion than our gross margin, and reached 33.7% in the quarter. Our GAAP operating cash flow was 212 million in the quarter, which represented 26% of revenue, another record for us. Our diluted earnings per share, even though revenue was up 10, our earnings were up 20% to $1.48, and that brought the full-year earnings to 4.96 a share versus 4.34 last year. It really was broad-based, as you’ll see this morning. Next slide? If you look at the income statement in the quarter, our orders were up 12%. Organic was up 4. Our revenue was up 10 and organic was up 3. For the people who look at book-to-bill relationships, our book-to-bill in the fourth quarter was a little bit better than the fourth quarter of last year, and we finished the full year ’12 at a book-to-bill of 1. Our gross profit was 57.9%, up 300 basis points. I don’t think anybody would have believed Roper would have achieved a 58% gross margin at this time, but we’ve done that and we think it’s pretty sustainable. Our operating income was up 23% and our operating margin was up 300 basis points due to that 57% operating leverage in the quarter. Again, if you add non-cash amortization to that, that number would be another sort of 4 points higher. Our interest expense was up from 15 to 21 million because we had a successful $900 million bond offering which closed on November 15 in the fourth quarter. That bond offering set records for execution in terms of spreads on our rating. There were a number of very favorable things about that bond offering, and of course it sharply reduces the rate at which our interest costs will be coming in in the future.  Our tax rate was a little higher in the fourth quarter. It was 30.1% versus last year’s 29, and that actually cost us $0.02 in the quarter. You can also think about it in terms of an amortization that if it was $0.02 in the quarter, it would have been $0.08 for the year; so a point of tax reduction for us is worth $0.08 a share, so let’s root for governmental tax reform. Net earnings, as you can see, up 21% and DEPS up 20%. Thank you, next slide. We go to EBITDA growth. Here you’ll see we closed out the full year at 925 million of EBITDA, which is up 45% just in the last two years; and our EBITDA margins just continue to move up. You can see they’re up to 30.8% for the full year. That’s 410 basis points above where they were just two years ago. Most importantly about this slide is that while our gross margins are already at 30.8%, we’re going to tell you that in 2013 we expect them to expand still further. Next slide? Our cash flow performance was 212 million in the fourth quarter, representing 26% of revenue and cash conversion of 147. On a free cash flow basis, you can see it was 25% of revenue and 141%. While our cash flow is already best in class, our ratios continue to improve. As you can see here on the right-hand side of the chart, our free cash flow reached 639 million, up from 471 two years ago; but if you look at the percentage at the bottom, you’ll see that in 2010 our free cash flow to revenue was 19.7% and this year it was 21.3%, up another 160 basis points in just two years. Next slide? If you look at our asset velocity performance, there are a couple of very important things about this slide. Our inventory was actually down at the end of the year at 5.9%. Payables were about 4.3, by the way, so remember our goals were to always try to get inventory and payables to be close together so that it’s just receivables that are investment around pricing in the way we think about things. So we closed out the year with inventory plus receivables less payables and accruals at 4.8%, truly a remarkable number. What’s really interesting and encouraging to us – you can see in 2010, ’11 and ’12 we now have a sustainable level of performance that says we need less than $0.06 of working capital to create a dollar of revenue, and that’s really an exceptional result and sustainable. Next slide? If we look at the financial position of the company and the balance sheet, you can see even though we invested over 1.4 billion in 2012, our balance sheet is still in terrific shape. Cash is slightly higher. Our undrawn revolver, of course, is much higher and our cash and undrawn revolver powder are up here at 1.771 billion versus 1.088, so after investing over 1.4 billion we’ve still got about 700 million more powder than we did last year. You can see our trailing 12 months EBITDA at 9.25, when you then do the debt ratios, gross debt to EBITDA is about 2.2 but net debt to EBITDA is only (inaudible). We’ll generate, we think, well in excess of 700 million in free cash flow in ’13 to go on top of that, so not impossible to envision us having 2.5 billion to invest soon. Next slide? Here we’ll look individually at the various segment details – next slide. This is probably the most remarkable slide in the deck in my opinion. When you think about execution, every one of our segments is doing spectacularly well. You have four segments and you have four quarters, and you’ll see here we were a perfect 16 for 16 in execution where every segment increased its margin over the prior year in every quarter. If you look at the industrial technology, you can see revenue for the year was up 8%, operating profit up 15%, and operating margin reached 30% - was up 190 basis points. If you look at energy systems, here revenue was up 8%, operating profit up 14, and operating profit margin up 140 basis points. In medical, revenue was up 17%, operating profit up 35%, and OP margin up 380 basis points to 28.1. And then finally, while revenue was flat in our largest segment in RF, operating profit was up 10% and our operating margin was up 250 basis points. Lastly on this slide, where you can see really we were up 8%, 8%, 17%, and then flat, the overall company came in up 7% in revenue and up 55% in operating leverage with our largest segment flat for the year, so it speaks really well of the diversity of the things we have going for us in our businesses. Next slide? If we look at the energy systems and control segment, you will see in the fourth quarter we were up 7% in revenue and 16% in OP, a remarkable operating profit margin of 33.1%. Organic revenue was up 6% in the fourth quarter. Our margin expansion was led primarily by the leverage on growth of the incremental sales and then the benefit of some cost actions that we took in the third quarter in anticipation of some recessionary risks that we might have seen at that time, which have dissipated. Compressor controls growth was led again by our LNG projects around the world, and certainly an all-time record in the field service activity associated with those products and the aftermarket that they create. We had a double-digit increase in our alpha technology company, which is really an instrument-based data capturing technology that tire company and latex OEMS use for measuring; and we have very strong seasonal demand in the fourth quarter which we expected to have when we issued guidance. In the 2013 year as we look ahead, we think compressor controls will continue to generate record levels of revenue with new applications for existing software in the installed base of operations that we’ve enjoyed with our growth recently adds substantially to the customer service profile. We also have made several bolt-on acquisitions. We don’t talk a lot about those, but this year alone we acquired a company called Cambridge Instruments which helps our PAC business with online data collection. We acquired Hao Ying in China, a small sensor company that goes in with our Dynisco product in the Shanghai area; and just on the last day of the year, we acquired another small business that relates to our diesel engine shut-off valve technology. And those go along with late 2011 acquisitions, United Controls and Trinity Software for compressor controls, so these bolt-ons coupled with organic growth should continue to give us a strong 2013 for energy. Next slide? If we look at our industrial technology segment, here you’ll see it was actually down 1% in the fourth quarter, but operating profit was up a couple of points. We had a favorable benefit due to an accounting thing that happened in the fourth quarter, so the published margins are a little bit better than what we—we’re discounting that as a one-time event, so we’re coming in at operating profit 29.9 versus the GAAP number of 32.7.  In the fourth quarter, fluid handling continued to be very strong with our directional drillings operations at Roper Pump. Everything related to fracking and oil shale was good, except for lower demand for de-watering pumps and basically in the gas arena. Our Cornell company received a product innovation of the year award for new cutter pump technology that we introduced that breaks up debris and wastewater and reduces clogging, which we think will lead to strong growth for us in that segment. Our material test business at Struers remained exceptionally strong as it related to consumables, although some of the equipment sales were lower than they were in the prior year. Neptune is an interesting story in that overall it was flat in the quarter, but that really belies the fact that Neptune had an all-time record year in 2012. We had very strong distributor growth in the fourth quarter of this year and a little bit of incremental growth out of the Toronto project; but as we said at the end of the third quarter, we had lost one large customer and the impact of that came in the fourth quarter, so that it negated what was actually double-digit revenue growth throughout the country. We had very exceptional margin performance at nearly 30%, and it really was broad-based throughout the segment.  As we look to next year in 2013, the fluid handling oil shale growth will continue. We have a variety of new products that we continue to add to Roper Pumps’ directional drilling technologies. We added capacity in 2012 to give us better throughput and faster turnaround at our (inaudible) operation, and in 2013 something that I think no one would have ever expected us to say is we’re actually investing in a new facility in Texas for much larger diameter staters and power sections than we have today due to the growth and prospects for market share gains which are occurring quite rapidly in this segment. In the second half of the year, we think we’ll get better fluid handling rental market activity that ought to boost Cornell. We think throughout the year, the other businesses will have sort of low single-digit growth in their industrial end markets; and at Neptune with a little stronger work out of Toronto’s project, an improved housing start here in the U.S., better distribution sales growth should largely offset the customer loss, which will be quite significant in the first half of the year. Next slide? In our RF technology segment, here you can see revenue for the quarter was flat but operating profit was up 8% and the OP margin was 27%, which is quite good margin for that segment. We had very solid execution in creating that margin expansion and most of that came out of better management in the toll and traffic arena. We’ve really made a number of people changes in that segment and have a new leader who’s been with the company for quite some time. He’s doing an outstanding job in building a stronger team around execution. TransCore received an important award for the Doha Airport for both access control and parking control in Doha, and we expect that will generate in the high millions, single-digit millions of dollars for us next year. TransCore also received a very prestigious award where they won what’s called the International Road Federation Global Achievement Award that was presented by the Chairman of the International Road Federation to the mayor of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. That was for the work that we did that we don’t talk a lot about in managing New York City traffic lights and traffic systems. Our ITS project in New York this past year also won an award as the outstanding project in the year. TransCore won another award for what are called HOV lane activity supports, and that was based really in California where they got the California Transportation Foundation’s 2012 Project of the Year Award. So our innovation and technological execution continues to be very strong in all these businesses. Our SAS-based subscriber base in the fourth quarter continued to grow and software margins then expanded as a result, which helped the segment. In CBORD, which we indicated had won a major university in the northeast, we can now tell you that that actually was Northeastern University; and as you all know, Northeastern has quite a large campus footprint and we’re going to be doing integrated security projects for them for quite some time. Our bid activity is exceptionally robust at CBORD for 2013. As we look at next year, our backlog and project pipelines in this segment give us a lot of confidence around pretty good growth in 2013. Our technolog growth profile should return. You may remember that technolog is really what’s holding back RF technologies apparent organic growth in 2012 because we had over a $20 million project in France in 2011 which of course wouldn’t repeat into ’12 and was a headwind of more than $5 million a quarter. Our software recurring revenue base we think will continue to expand as we get an increasing number of new customers, and we think our margin improvement that you see this year will continue and strengthen in 2013. Next slide? If you look at the medical and scientific imaging segment, pretty soon I think we can just call it the medical segment. This really became the largest segment in the company in the fourth quarter, which is hard to believe, but you had organic revenue growth of 6% in the quarter which of course was led by medical. Our Northern Digital business delivered a record quarter as their OEM system sales for minimally invasive surgical placement hit an all-time high, and then Sunquest we had the benefit of for the full quarter. Our integration is really very much on track here with Sunquest, and the data now kind of shows you just how strong a company Sunquest is and what kind of performance you get out of it. We’ll continue, I think, to demonstrate that as you see them in for a full year in 2013. We also took a charge as we’ve made considerable changes at Verathon to drive faster product introduction and have started to discontinue some efforts around certain engineering initiatives and pare back the rate at which we roll out some of the products that were in their pipeline that we think, while they are interesting, they are not as interesting as other new opportunities we’re focused on. So we took a $4 million charge in the quarter on inventory and tooling around a product line that we think may do okay but not at the pace that we were prepared to continue to invest in. As we look at 2013, you’ll see we’re going to get a significant benefit out of a full year of Sunquest contributions. Our margins, we think are going to continue to expand as Sunquest becomes a larger piece of the mix of this segment, and we think we’ll get operating leverage out of organic growth. Our medical businesses, we think all have favorable end markets. We’ve got a number of strategic initiatives that have been put in place under the fellows leading our segment here – Neil, we brought on in at the end of third quarter of 2011. We think we’ll finally get a little bit of modest improvement in our research markets that relate to the cameras. Camera, this year has been a terrific headwind, down about 13% over the prior year, but came in sort of flat in the fourth quarter which is finally a trend we’ve been looking for. We think it will actually have positive growth on a modest level in 2013. Next slide? If you look at our 2013 guidance – next slide – we establish guidance for the full year at 560 to 582, so that gives you a midpoint of 571 versus 496 this year at the midpoint. We’d be up 15.1% on a net earnings basis. We’re projecting revenuer growth of 8 to 10%. We think organic ought to be up 3 to 5. We think organic in the first half of the year will be quite modest, particular stress on Q1. We think we’ll be up in the high single digits organic growth rate in the third and fourth quarter.  Foreign exchange, we’re just assuming the 12/31 rates would continue. Tax rate, a little higher next year at 31%. Diluted share count, we think will come in at about 100.5 million shares, and then if you look at our Q1 guidance we’re saying $1.19 to $1.23. Full-year operating cash flow, we think will exceed 775 million – that’s up about 100 million from what we just delivered here this past year.  I think what’s really important is that if you look at the power of our cash-on-cash return models now as they start to really compound, that 775 million for 2013, when we look out in the next three years – ’13, ’14 and ’15 – we would expect to generate over 2.5 billion in operating cash flow, and that gives us of course an incredible amount of flexibility for investing in these businesses. Next slide? If you look at the summary then for 2012, you can see that we achieved really all-time record results. Total revenue was up 7% for the year even though our largest segment had no revenue increase; organic revenue up 4%, our gross margin up 180 basis points to 56% for the year, operating margin was up 220 basis points to 25.8% on operating leverage that exceeded 50% on the next dollar of revenue. Our non-cash amortization for 2012 was $117 million, which really understates the quality of our operating earnings; so if you add the non-cash amortization back into the operating margin or the interest before tax, if you will, you get an EBITDA ratio of 29.6%.  Our EBITDA was 125 million up over the prior year, and our EBITDA margins for the full-year were at 30.8%. We’ve already told you we expect those to expand in 2013. Our CAPEX for the year was 38 million, which is exactly the same as depreciation; and when we talk about EBITDA, we really need to get Roper to distinguish the awareness around other people’s EBITDA has a lot of D and a lot of CAPEX it needs to offset it. Ours simply doesn’t. This is really all EBIT-A with just 38 million of D and 38 million of offsetting CAPEX. Operating cash flow for the full-year at 678 million represented 23% of revenue, and we hope to add over 100 million to that for this year. We invested over a 1.4 billion in acquisitions. Our deal pipeline now is as exciting as ever. We expect to capture additional opportunities in 2013 and we’ve already got over 1.5 billion of powder before we add another 700 million to that as the year progresses. So with that, we’d like to open it up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now go to our question and answer portion of the call. [Operator instructions] We’ll take our first question from Dean Dray with Citi Research. 
Dean Dray – Citi Research:  Thank you. Good morning everyone. On the medical side, you were flat on organic revenue growth. Did you see any pull-in from some of the year-end business getting pulled in, maybe related to the pending tax increase or any budget flush?
Brian Jellison: No, we really didn’t see that at all, and most of our stuff is kind of going direct so it’s not a like a distributor pull-in with standard products that some other people might have.
Dean Dray – Citi Research: And then Brian, when you talk about the acquisition capacity approaching 2.5 billion, for the medical side are you more apt to pursue adjacencies, new products, new platforms in SAS like you’ve done in Sunquest, or would you be looking more in the device side like Verathon, Northern Digital, where you can drop a product line into your sales force?
Brian Jellison:  Well, we would and are doing both. You just never know what you’re able to negotiate in terms of what’s the best use of funds. So we’re always really looking at the asset velocity of things, so the software businesses have an easier hurdle because they always have less assets. If their product businesses are such that we think they’re well positioned and have great defense mechanisms, we’re not opposed to adding to that.  As a general rule, there certainly are some product transactions we’re looking at now, but most of the things we’re looking at are related to software and service opportunities.
Dean Dray – Citi Research: Great, that’s helpful. Just one last one if I could – on the Neptune customer loss, give us some perspective, was this on pricing? Is it a market share shift? You said that there would be some impact in the next couple quarters.
Brian Jellison: Yeah, it’s a very large customer who has decided that they want to go to take the risk associated with the composite meters. We don’t think it says anything other than they’re going to try something else. We had a long-term contract with them that—and they had a change in management, and we’ll see how it works out. It will have an effect on the first half of this year from a revenue viewpoint. I don’t think it’s indicative of anything; in fact, we were up nearly 20% in (inaudible) sales in the fourth quarter, so you can’t see it. We wound up being flat because you got one large customer that’s down. John, I don’t know if you want to add anything to Dean’s question around the customer situation? I think it’s a one-off thing that—
John Humphrey:  Yeah, I’d agree with that.
Brian Jellison: It sort of supply chain people making the decision instead of operating people. I know the operating people aren’t happy about it.
John Humphrey: And it’s one of those things that—I mean, it’s important in terms of Neptune, but once it gets to the Roper level, it really gets not as material, for sure. It will be an impact for the first quarter and the first half.
Dean Dray – Citi Research Dean Dray – Citi Research:  Great, thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Matt Summerville with Keybanc.
Matt Summerville – Keybanc: Morning. Just a couple questions. Brian, can you talk a little bit about later in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, the kind of order dynamics you’re seeing in your shorter cycle businesses like Dynisco, and you mentioned Struer equipment sales down. Has that trend changed?
Brian Jellison: Well, what’s important about the fourth quarter – it’s a great question, Matt – is we have three businesses: Dynisco, which is always supplying things which frequently have to do with capacity utilization; Struer, which is somewhat similar to that in terms of their consumables; and then our core AMOT business. Those three were leading indicators for us in Q4 of 2008 when you went into the ’09 downturn, so we’re looking at those things weekly.  In the fourth quarter, they did better than the concern level you would have had, so we haven’t really seen anything in those businesses yet that would indicate that there’s any forward indicator; and in fact, December shipments were stronger for the businesses than October and November, which resulted in us having a little bit more receivables at the end of the year than we would have liked to have had, but you know, it’s the year-end stuff that happens frequently.  So I don’t think there’s anything that makes us nervous, and in the case of the equipment it wasn’t core equipment that we provide out of Struers for cutting technology. We have a line of hardness testers that we sell, and they were off in the fourth quarter. Fortunately they’re lower margin products, so it wasn’t overly material, but it’s something we’re keeping our eye on.
Matt Summerville – Keybanc: And then just one follow-up – can you just talk about what you’re seeing out of Sunquest in terms of pro forma organic revenue growth versus your expectation going into the deal?
John Humphrey: Sure. I mean, they continue to do extremely well. We’re seeing high single digit organic growth out of that business, and we would expect to see that continue into 2013 also.
Matt Summerville – Keybanc: Thanks Brian. Thanks John.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Good morning gentlemen. Looking at your expectations of expanded EBITDA margins in 2013, can you help break down a little bit how much you expect in gross margin improvement versus operating expense growth? It seems like a lot of—I think certainly some of it is going to come from Sunquest, but if you can break that down, it’d be helpful.
John Humphrey: You know, I’m going to need to follow up with you on that. We do expect to see gross margin expansion along with operating margin expansion, both because our faster growing businesses are also our higher margin businesses on the software side as well as on medical and the impact from Sunquest. So probably not quite as much on gross margin as we’re expecting on EBITDA margin, but both of them we expect to be up in ’13.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Okay. And then on Neptune again, Brian, it’s still been a pretty strong couple of years. Is there any ramp-down in sales and projects outside of the one that you lost, and what are expectations for the industry, and then with Neptune relative to the industry in 2013? And do you expect more people to go—maybe even shift to the composite?
Brian Jellison: Well, I think as far as the situation is, you’re going to get—we would get a disproportionate amount of new meters associated with housing starts, so as housing starts are picking up, so are our sales through distribution in the U.S. water market. So we expect pretty decent growth there, certainly high single digits, maybe more; and so other people who have lower shares than we do are likely to get some corresponding benefit in their business. I think it’s a generally favorable or more favorable market than it has been for replacement water meters and for just installs for (inaudible). When it comes to the rest of the world, that’s an entirely different story and our products really don’t play in anything other than the high pressure water market. Composite meters, nobody’s had great success with those over time. We don’t see any shifts to that at all except in people who come in who don’t know the industry, don’t know the products, and think everything is uniform because they’re SAP people. They can do things that will be proven to be a mistake later, and so we’re not really bothered by that. It’s not the first time we’ve lost a customer only to get them back a little bit later when they realize that value is more important than price.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Thanks, good morning. Brian, just apparent liquidity notwithstanding, wondering how you’re looking at the short to long-term acquisition pipeline, how you’re thinking about the range of scale and breadth, and if you see any scenario where a modest share issuance would be appropriate or warranted.
Brian Jellison: Well, I think we’re pretty reluctant to want to issue any equity. I really just don’t see the need for that. The reason that we do acquisitions is because we have great free cash flow, and when you lever that at, say, three times debt to EBITDA the acquired company, you can really make a material difference in your growth rate and kind of in the perpetuity growth rate of the enterprise, and that’s what we do. We just think that’s the best way to create shareholder value. If we wanted to increase—I mean, I don’t know why we’d issue equity unless it was just the most incredible, spectacular thing of all time, and we did that in December of 2003 when we acquired Neptune and didn’t have really a high quality public company balance sheet. We did it again in December of 2004 when we acquired Neptune. Those acquisitions represented four times trailing EBITDA of the company, for heaven’s sakes, in terms of what we had to do. You know, with trailing EBITDA with a run rate well in excess of a billion, we’re not planning on a $4 billion deal tomorrow at noon. So I think we can be quite satisfied with 1.5 billion-plus a year in acquisition growth, so I don’t think we would issue equity.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Thanks. And then the other one would be let’s go a little bit more into the bridge from the current orders rates to the EPS target for next year – very strong, but had some backlog runoff in the second half. We’ve gotten some color, but if we could just dive into any more qualitative around that.
John Humphrey: Sure. I think as we went through our—not only the planning activity that we always do but also the fourth quarter operating reviews that we go through with each of our businesses, we look not only at what they actually did in the fourth quarter but their projections for the first quarter and the rest of the year, and what’s in their backlog, what’s in their pipeline of opportunities. As we went through that, we saw a number of things, both on the new product introduction side but also on the projects that are currently being bid and currently in front of us, not yet in backlog, that give us confidence that the second half of the year we’ll see a higher organic growth rate than what we’re going to see in the first half of the year. But I think that that’s going to be weighted more toward—well, probably RF will be a little bit stronger than industrial for the full year basis, but overall we expect to see full-year organic growth in all four of our segments.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Yes. Brian, just a couple questions. In the energy systems business, the book-to-bill in the fourth quarter was maybe a little bit softer than we typically see seasonally. Has anything, again, maybe slowed there or is that just a comparison issue? And then within that, the compressor controls, the acquisitions you made, the smaller ones, it sounds like they’re bringing software into compressor controls. Is that the right way to think about that? I mean, are these companies bringing customers or are they bringing code? What are these small acquisitions—how do they expand the business?
Brian Jellison: Well, I’ll take the latter and then we’ll shift back to the nature of the orders. Each one of them is a little different, but United Controls brought with it a very significant engine manufacturer that we were not doing business with, and so that gave us a customer benefit. It also gave us some application engineering capability with that business that supports what we do, so that was good. It also gave us some improved regional activity in some parts of the world. Trinity Software was an entirely different concept where it had some breakthrough code, to use your term. It really has breakthrough technology that’s in its infancy. It’s going to be in maybe high single digit millions, but it’s the kind of thing that can move up quite dramatically over the next three years, so we’re investing a lot of time in bringing our business processes to that group of people. Cambridge is not in compressor controls. It’s in petroleum analyzer, and we have some, if not the best equipment in the world in analyzing different things for refineries, but we don’t have a lot of online capability and Cambridge brings us an opportunity to have online capability in software. So that’s an important growth venue for us. Now on the order flow and seasonality of fourth quarter, John, why don’t you take that?
John Humphrey: Yeah, sure. In terms of the fourth quarter orders for energy, they were actually in line with what we had expected. What we’re seeing, of course, is with many of the projects that compressor controls has already completed and now it’s moving into field service, it changes the timing of those orders. It’s more of a book-and-ship, or a book and then maybe ship two or three months later when you recognize the revenue associated with field service, as opposed to their larger projects which oftentimes would—distort is probably not the right word, but would affect the book-to-bill ratio in fourth quarters of prior years. The other areas that we normally look for and did see seasonal benefits, both on the instrument side for Alpha Technologies and also on our petroleum analyzer business – once again, providing software algorithms and testing solutions for refineries – we did see a seasonal uptick in the fourth quarter, but that was both on revenue and orders so that seasonal uptick really didn’t change the book-to-bill ratio very much. 
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Okay, I understand. And then just a last question – in the RF tech business, we talked about some pretty nice wins on the tolling and CBORD side. This RF tech is always a little difficult to model out given the timing and the size of these projects, but when you think about ’13 and project out ’13 in your forecast, can RF tech have a double-digit growth year for ’13?
John Humphrey: It can. I don’t think that that’s embedded in our guidance, though.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Okay, can but we shouldn’t time this out to the point where we’ll get a—
John Humphrey: Yeah, our expectation with respect to 3 to 5% organic growth for the year, like I said, it’s a little bit more heavily weighted. RF may be above that, but we’re not ready to say that’s going to be double-digit yet.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Brian Jellison: Although for our internal people listening, we expect you to move along those lines! 
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: With better margin, huh? Great, thank you. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: Good morning. I’d like to address the guidance that you announced as you set a 15.1% increase over last year, and if you adjust for the higher tax rate, it’s about 17.5% increase. But that’s less than the company’s long-term average growth, the 20%. I don’t want to seem ungrateful – 17.5% is still pretty good. It seems that some of that is in the first quarter because that guidance is only up 11% from last year. Are you being too conservative here on looking at a weak economy? Just exactly what are the assumptions behind the guidance, because it isn’t as strong as, for example, you did in 2012. Is it possible that you’re getting so big or your margins are getting so high that you can’t get the same percentage increase in margins relative to the increase in sales that you’ve gotten in the past? Could you address all that?
John Humphrey: Alex, I think one of the factors when you’re looking at our previous years’ growth rates, of course those always include not only what we do on an organic basis but also the effect of acquisitions; and our guidance for 2013, as it always does, excludes any acquisitions that we have not yet completed. So I think that is probably going to be one of the differences you see between our guidance and the actuals as they roll in, Sunquest being an example of that – of course, that added both accretive earnings but more importantly accretive cash flow to us for 2012. We would expect future acquisitions, although they’re never in our guidance, to be accretive from a cash basis also. Whether they are accretive on an earnings basis is always going to be dependent upon the accounting ramifications of amortization and other things.
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: Right. Well yes, and when they come in the year.
John Humphrey :  That’s also true.
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: It’s possible you could have accretive acquisitions that really wouldn’t add to 2013 if they came late in the year.
John Humphrey: That is true.
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: But could you address your economic assumptions and why the first quarter is only up 11%? Because that would not include—I mean, that wouldn’t be because you haven’t added in acquisitions to the first quarter guidance, because you don’t have time to—
John Humphrey: That is correct. That is correct, so kind of as we talked about a little bit earlier, we do expect the organic sales growth to be higher in the second half based upon what we’re seeing from a project pipeline and execution of our existing backlog relative to the first quarter. We also have in the first half a little bit of headwind associated with the Neptune customer that decided not to renew with us. So those are some of the things that we’re seeing – a little bit tougher comp against last year where we had 8% organic growth in the first quarter of last year. It’s a little bit of a tougher comp versus what we see for Q2, Q3 and Q4 as we go forward.
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: Okay. Then a follow-up – why is the tax rate up?
John Humphrey: Well, Sunquest as a U.S.-based company generates most of their earnings in the United States, which is the highest tax rate in the world, and so those earnings come in at a marginal tax rate of probably 38 to 39%. And then just other normal tax planning activities, which is probably the—which is definitely the smaller portion of the increase that we expect for ’13.
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: Yeah, we definitely need corporate tax reform. Thanks.
John Humphrey: I wouldn’t say protection; I’d just say a level playing field.
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude today’s question and answer session for this call. I will now turn the call back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Okay. Thank you all for joining us and we look forward to talking to you as we finish our first quarter.
Operator: That concludes today’s conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Please standby. The Roper Industries’ Third Quarter 2012 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Casey. And thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our third quarter. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Jason Conley, who Heads our Planning and Investor Relations for us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today’s call. We prepared slides to accompany today’s call, which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com. Now, if you please turn to slide two, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today’s call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today’s call in the context of that information. Now, if you please turn to slide three, today we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on a non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures was included in our press release this morning, as also a part of this presentation which is available on our website. The difference between the GAAP and the non-GAAP measures as we will be talking about them today is really made up of the following three discrete items. First, a fair value adjustment to acquire deferred revenue at Sunquest, for the quarter this impact was $3.1 million to revenue and operating profit. This adjustment represents revenue that absent our acquisition Sunquest would have recognized. We believe showing our results on this basis provide additional insight into the ongoing and recurring results of the business. Second, we incurred $6.3 million of acquisition-related costs specific to Sunquest. Finally we recorded a $1 million non-cash charged to earnings in the quarter for the early termination of our credit facility. We believe discussing our results excluding these three discrete items provide investors with additional insights and improve understanding of the trends of our business. And now if you please turn to slide four, I’ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. And after his prepared remarks, we’ll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. So we’ll go through the Q3 enterprise financial results, which were really quite good. Look at segment detail and then take a look at our Q4 guidance and what the implications are for the full year. I’ll give you a summary and then take questions from people. So next slide, we look at the Q3 enterprise financial results, we had an all time third quarter record for most everything accounts, most orders in the history, highest level of revenue, sales, biggest level of backlog, $1 billion almost again, net earnings were an all time record, as well as EBITDA and cash flow both on an operating and free cash flow basis. Our revenue was up 5%, but that included $0.02 headwind on foreign exchange otherwise revenue would have been up 7%, with organic growth up 3%. If you look at the operating margin expansion it was really remarkable at 220 basis points up from what already best-of-class operating margins to 25.7%. Our operating leverage was kind of beyond remarkable, I have to put this in the spectacular category, if you look at incremental sales and incremental op, operating leverage in the quarter was 67%. This really attribute to the nimble business model we have with break-even analysis and various analysis. We get to the end, we kind of talk about year-to-date, just how well our operating leverage has gone and why that so important for the fourth quarter and in 2013. Our EBITDA in the quarter was $231 million. EBITDA margin was also up 220 basis points to 30.8% at the enterprise level. Our GAAP operating cash flow is $205 million or 27% of revenue and it’s also up 23% from the third quarter last year. And our diluted earnings per share were at $1.24 up from a $1.12 in the prior year, cash conversion was spectacular, we talk about that when we get into the balance sheet and cash flow, but really exceptional margin expansion throughout the enterprise. Next slide, if we look at the income statement in Q3, I start out with orders being basically flat to the prior year up a $1 million and the reason for that is and we have a lot of variability in book-to-bill over the last two and half years, almost always due to just project push outs coming in plus we have a difficult GAAP to proj comp finally goes away in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date book to bill is the same as it generally and these quarterly variances, we don’t read much into it long as they are only driven by what happened with project bookings which we rarely have any control over. So orders were probably better than they really looked in this chart. Revenue at $751 million was up 3% organically. Our gross profit moved from 53.7% up to 55.9%, remarkable 220 basis points improvement. And our operating income went up from the same 23.5% to 27.5%, another 220 basis points with that 67% incremental leverage. Actually, it was worse in the third quarter than last year. It cost us $0.03 a share compared to last year’s baseline numbers because we had fewer than 48 rollouts in the third quarter of this year than we did last year. And our reported $24 includes about $2 million of restructuring expenses in energy that would have added a penny if we would have excluded that to hit a $25. Sort of a note to July, it was quite okay and September was strong with August being kind of down within the quarter. We’ll talk more about that when we get to those segments. So we actually feel better today than we did in the middle of the quarter. Our Q3 operating reviews were much more optimistic when we held those in October than our mid-quarter discussions in August. Next slide, our EBITDA growth trend continues to see our Q3 trailing 12 months EBITDA back in 2010 with $585 million. We’ve added $287 million to that to reach the $872 million on it, fairly 12-month basis now. And questions are we always get are, well, how are you ever going to be able to hold this 25% EBITDA margins and our answer to our people and to everybody is we’re not going to settle for 25% EBITDA margins. We don’t have to settle for that kind of a number. And here you see we’re up another 390 basis points in last two years to 29.8% EBITDA on a trailing 12 month basis, 49% over the last two years. Next slide, on our Q3 cash flow, it’s simply spectacular. $205 million of operating cash flow represents 27% of revenue or $197 million of free cash flow represents 26% of revenue. It’s the 15th consecutive year where free cash flow has exceeded net earnings. You can see we’ve moved up here from $437 million of trailing cash flow in 2010 third quarter to $618 million now. Year-to-date, our cash conversion is quite strong and we’ll have an even stronger performance in the fourth quarter. Our cash conversion in the third quarter was 176% on a GAAP basis with 166% on a non-GAAP basis. And all these numbers are all time record numbers of cash flow. Next slide, if we look at the Q3 balance sheet, you’ll see even after absorbing the $1.4 billion acquisition of Sunquest in August, we still have an exceptionally strong balance sheet. Cash has improved. Our undrawn revolver is less than it was or it’s about same, it was down a little bit. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA that we’re showing here at $779 million at September a year ago, $872 million now that excludes any pro forma from Sunquest which would add dramatically to that number. So when you look at the statistics around gross debt to cap, there are 37%. If we get net debt to net cap, it would be 32.8%. Our gross debt to EBITDA is only 2.4 and as you perform Sunquest, of course, it would be much closer to two. We really have ample capacity to do any kind of transaction if we like to do and we still see a number of things in the pipeline that we’re discussing look attractive to us. Next slide, we can answer the specifics around segment details here. Next slide, in the third quarter, our segment pro forma which was again remarkable. Across the board in all the segments, you can see gross margins at 52%, 52%, 55%, and 66%. And you can see EBITDA margins within each segment, they were all above 30% and all of those are just leading us with a tremendous amount of flexibility with our balance sheet and ability to reinvest for growth in our existing business. Next slide, we start with RF technology which is our largest percentage of revenue at 29% within the quarter. You can see on an organic basis, I had a modest fall off, eight-tenths of 1% in revenue, which was really due to a specific push out in a job we have in Texas that we expected to start to deliver in the third quarter, which looks like it might even move in the first half of next year. But we had great margin expansions. You can see operating profit was up 10% and operating profit margins were up 280 basis points. We had some project activity that we expected to come in that really costs us between $5 million and $10 million against what we thought was possible that we were kind of assuming is going to come into the first half of next year, some chance, that it could move into the fourth quarter of this year, some of that. Overall, the growth is really massed by 5% headwind from Q3 projects last year that were unusual that one-time installer trends and very large installation project at Miami University for CBORD. Our SaaS-based businesses continue to grow in this quarter led by our freight match subscriber base increase which was quite substantial. These pushouts that we have had, we have very high confidence that they are going to be entering our order book within the next six months. So once again we feel bit better about orders that have book to bill flat line number. Next slide, in the fourth quarter, we have growth expected to improve in our toll and traffic project activity based on the timing that we have. And we know that our margin expansion as the SaaS business continue to grow as a portion of the SaaS business will continue to give us improved margin that report job in the Middle East with one of the airports. Mostly other things we have going on. We unfortunately just can’t talk about yet because they are not public. Next slide. On industrial technology, we had organic growth in industrial technology of 10%. So it continued to perform frankly better than our expectations. It did have 3% of foreign currency headwind. The operating margin there is amazing. I mean, our operating profit in the quarter was 30.8%. That’s an all time operating profit margin which was driven by terrific executionist. People are prepared to take out costs. There is any kind of downturn and just on top of everyone there are variances. The Neptune Toronto project rollout continued were now about 25% complete with several years ahead of us. We have over 100,000 units installed in the field in Canada. Now, our fluid handling business remained very strong in the quarter. Their oil shale activity that we have around directional drilling with some unique technology there offset the expected reduced demand we had on pressure pumps in the natural gas application. So that really came in stronger than we might have guessed. And our material gas business continue to grow both in North America and actually had modest improvement in Europe and Europe as whole for the enterprise, not just Industrial Technology, actually on am organic basis was flat in the third quarter whereas many people reporting organic negative growth in Europe. In the fourth quarter, you will see our extending margins in industrial, we expect to continue. We do have some growth comparisons that are going to become difficult for us in the fourth quarter. As Neptune, we get a benefit possibly from modest improvement in housing starts. However, in the fourth quarter that tends not to help that much, that’s going to have to be more of, once you have returned to better client activity in 2013. But that’s going to be offset by a four year long program we’ve had with an individual customer that’s rolling off and that’s going to be about $5 million revenue in headwind within the quarter. And then we have, of course, the fall off in shale activity for pressure pumps in the natural gas application. But the rest of the activity, industrial looks strong in the quarter.  Next slide, the Energy Systems and Control segment, it had organic growth of 4%, but we’ve got, of course, being at, generally a lot of non-U.S. activity there, FX hurt us by 3%. We had very solid margin expansion despite taking a $2 million charge in two of our businesses in energy for a little bit of retention and it cost us a penny a share, certainly good investment, might be a tiny bit more of that in the fourth quarter. Revenue was up 5%, operating profit was up double digits at 11% and the operating profit margin came in at 27.1%, up 140 basis points. The Compressor Controls business, which as always been project oriented and still is project oriented is growing its field service activity at such a fast cliff that the field service is beginning to change our book-to-bill ratio dynamics in this segment, because the field service is, while it’s not subscription-based, certainly is a continue input around activity. And then kind of a fresh benefit is that we had nuclear plant inspections added to growth here in the third quarter, which is the first time, we can say something positive about Vitec in a long time. Refinery instrumentation demand though remained very weak and that -- lot of that’s European business activity. In the fourth quarter, we expect to have strong seasonal Q4 demand and the nuclear inspection activity is going to continue as it’s already scheduled, and we expect to get margin expansion from both growth and some of the benefits to these cost actions that we’ve already taken. Next slide. In the fourth quarter, I’m sorry, the Medical and Scientific Imaging business, you’d see here, this is where you are beginning to see the initial effect. Sunquest coming in, it will be -- you will see that in a much larger way of course in the fourth quarter and in 2013. But even given that you can see revenue in the quarter was up 12%, operating profit was up 28% and the operating profit margin was up 340 basis points to 28.1%. Now acquisitions were 16% of that, we had actually a negative organic growth of 3% in the segment because of the academic research markets being down double digits. The good news for us is that medical already represents more than two-thirds of the revenue in the segment and the medical was approaching much higher percentage of the total operating profit in the segment, as the imaging businesses become far, far less important to our overall portfolio. The Sunquest acquisition is completed. It’s off to a very good start around administrative and financial processes. It’s absolutely been the easiest transition we’ve ever had with any acquisition in our history. We have very gifted organization in place, not only from a marketplace and customer delivery perspective at Sunquest, but the administrative functions and processes are the best that we’ve seen in an acquisition anytime in our history. We have mid single-digit organic growth in Medical, driven mostly by OEM systems revenue out of our Northern Digital acquisition couple of years ago and the Verathon Glidescope demand, which continues to be quite substantial. I mentioned the weakness that we have in the academic research markets, which primarily impact to camera business, but photonics in general down double-digit. In the fourth quarter, those research markets are going to remain weak, but we finally left them, so the comparisons become easier and some of those businesses will actually have increase revenue in the fourth quarter over both the third quarter and the fourth quarter a year ago. We’ll have continued strength in the Medical platform. We get the full quarter benefit of Sunquest acquisition coming in there and quite a nice boost from Northern Digital on OEM products that we’ve introduced and arrangements that we’ve made with the important large brand key manufacturers. We get a little bit of benefit from our sanction acquisition, which is getting nested inside Northern Digital and then a modest continued improvement out of Verathon. We will have very dramatic margin expansion in the fourth quarter, as we get the benefit of some things we've done in the core businesses and then the much better margins that will be added to us as a result of Sunquest. One little noise factor that we’ve seen in the administrative arena and the academic research market is around some people concerned about China with the Japanese and Taiwanese customers who frequently export there, and the noise around that is something that’s hard to calibrate that does appeared to be real. Next slide, so here we’ll talk about the 2012 guidance and where we stand. Next slide, we look at the full year, we’ve initiated a full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per number of $4.91 to $4.97. This raises the midpoint to $4.94. The midpoint had been $4.92 on a $4.84 to $5 number. Last year, our non-GAAP EPS was $4.29 a share and remember we had a remeasurement gain of a nickel. We’ve brought the GAAP number from $4.34 down to $4.29, so that midpoint represents more than a 15% increase in EPS. But, of course, real story for us is going to be the cash. Our Q4 non-GAAP DEPS number, we’ve established to the $1.43 to a $1.49. That gives us an improvement over last year’s $1.23, somewhere between 16% and 21% in the fourth quarter. That midpoint of $1.46 is higher than consensus and if you only did the midpoint, you’d be about 19% above last year on a non-GAAP DEPS measurement. And again cash flow will be more important in our opinion than the DEPS measurement. Very exciting thing about fourth quarter for us is that, we’re going to hit a new milestone for Roper that we’ve never seen before, where in the fourth quarter our EBITDA will exceed $250 million in the quarter, meaning we’ll have an excess of $1 billion EBITDA run rate in the fourth quarter, which we are quite excited about. Next slide. If we look at the summary of activity in the third quarter, you can see that we’ve now demonstrated all these records related to orders, revenue, backlog, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow. We had across the Board margin expansion in all four segments, which was very comforting for us given the uncertain economic environment. Organic revenue at plus 3%, we would have like to see that a little bit higher, but when you adjust for the technical GAAP’s to fronts in the core and a little bit of push out in totaling, I guess it was better than most. Gross margins, spectacular, it hit 55.9%, our operating margins at 25.7%. Year-to-date, if you take the first nine months and you look at the revenue, you look at the op, you do that calculation, you will see that our operating leverage throughout the year is now above 50% of revenue. Now, we used to talk about 25% to 30% leverage out of EBITDA. And then occasionally, we get up to say well, maybe 30% -- maybe could be 35% my goodness it’s above 50% throughout the entire year at this point. Our free cash flow of $197 million was 26% of revenue. I don’t think there is any people that could point to step-by-step. Sunquest, we set very smooth transition lots of exciting opportunities, really looking at some bolt-on things on that arena and doing some things we think we’ll have big payoffs for 2013. Our balance sheet remains very strong. We have ample capacity, continue to invest in transactions. We’ve got not only a record year that we know will deliver in the 2012 year, but I think we can now say one position to another record year at 2013. So with that, I would like to open it up to questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We’ll take our first question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Thank you. Good morning.
Brian Jellison: Hey, good morning, Jeff.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Good morning. Well, maybe first question just pickup right where you left off, you bravely approached 2013 on a pretty uncertain environment. Obviously, you’ve got the Sunquest accretion, which would basically get you there. But if you think about the other businesses, could you elaborate a little bit on kind of the trends you are expecting as you exit the year in the next year?
Brian Jellison: Hey, I think we’re not going to provide any real guidance until we closed out the year. We generally do that with the year-end report. But I do think we were really taken by the -- we have a very formal quarterly review process. We talked to everyone of our P&L people. And when we talk to them in August, we were actually down 9% in orders in August and we were up late July, September. They were positive obviously or we would have the kind of performance you saw. People were really apprehensive I guess. And we are that kind of behind that so people are worried about that, but all of the customer contacts relatively favorable. Europe has performed a little better than we might have expected the industrial businesses with 10% organic growth in the third quarter, which kind of competing. We know what are challenges are in 2013. We will have some struggling activity unless founding starts picked up and Neptune that we need to overcome. But our toll and traffic businesses are going to be more robust next year then they have been. The medical scenario is going to be better. We have some great clarity around various things we are doing there. The CBORD is going to win at major Northeastern University that we can’t get announced. It’s very important, a large opportunity for us. We have some things that are going on in projects that we know are going to come to fruition. So we -- all those things that are negative, we kind of have those cooked out in our opinion unless there are some kind of much more precipitous falloff and so new field we are comfortable, I would say going into 2013 than we have it anytime this year.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Great. Thank you. And could you elaborate a little bit more on what you see on the scientific and research side that indicated the comp is easier in Q4. But do you have some thoughts on what sequester looks like for the business, for example, that happens next year and what actions you might take?
Brian Jellison: Well, we are taking some actions. But I don’t think that the sequester would have much effect because these are not really defense-related businesses. They are really research applications going mostly to university markets. I think that the U.S. is a fairly small part of where those businesses survey less than a third of low revenue. So, sequester would have any impact as it relates to Europe and Asia, which is where the lion share of our revenue, where those camera business resides. The other thing is it that they are of course better than other peoples businesses. They are -- the worst portion of the margin side of our OP in the company. So if they are down, they don’t have a kind of negative spin. It’s not quite having any of the other businesses -- have negative variances. So, they are really getting to the point where they have very little effect on the overall enterprise.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: And then just finally, and I have passed the time since you are kind enough to give us specific August order and that number down nine. Can you tell us what September was and what you are seeing in October?
Brian Jellison: With the gifted statistician such as your software read out to you to back into it, if they were modestly favorable. Our overall build to the year by the way is 101 and so we are preparing for all this, we are looking at that fasting owing to -- in the last five or six quarters, we’ve been all over the math. We used to say that our book-to-bill would be 0.97 or 1.03. And so certainly on our trailing basis, we’re right in that sweet spot. But we had number of quarters. In the last six month, we’ve been sort of outside the margin. And so the projects stop -- if we stop reporting orders, we wouldn’t have to waste time talking about it. But things are fine, they are going to continue to be good.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Great. Thank you very much.
Brian Jellison: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: Good morning, gentlemen.
Brian Jellison: Mark.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: Looking in the fourth quarter, well first of all what would be the organic orders in the quarter from 3Q?
John Humphrey: Organic orders were down 2%, so we kind of have to same 2% headwind on FX, so that’s.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: Okay.
John Humphrey: Okay. 
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: Okay. And then what we thinking as far as organic sales in fourth quarter kind of similar to what you saw in the third quarter?
John Humphrey: That based -- our guidance is based upon how low-single digit organic growth in the fourth quarter.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: Okay. And then we can talk about the medical segment, much higher operating profit than I think a lot of us saw how much of that is really due to Sunquest, and then also did you have some pretty custom cost actions I know medical now are above two thirds, but still two thirds of the businesses down double-digits to have margin expand that dramatically is pretty good, can you dive down to that a little more?
Brian Jellison: Well, I think you are right as far as the relative mix and we continue to grow with higher margin areas. Sunquest comes in above the company average operating profit margin. So, that give us a little bit tailwind, but even ups and down we still saw margin expansion in the segment as we continue to grow in medical versus the lower margin camera businesses. And the nice thing about those -- for the nice thing well, few nice things about this camera business is they do have a pretty variable cost structure. So the reason of large -- fixed cost they need to have restructuring actions, so they are able to flex some of their operating expenses revenue.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: Okay. Thank you.
Brian Jellison: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Deane Dray with Citi.
Deane Dray - Citi: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, would like to get some color regarding the restructuring actions taken in energy. You said there was a couple of projects, but and then suggest so you could do some more in the fourth quarter, maybe if you can just expand on that?
John Humphrey: Yeah. That’s largely severance-related actions, so it was right at $2 million in the quarter. Once again, with the asset license of this model, we don’t really have the larger restructuring charges that taken off a lot of time to a, implement and b, realize the benefits from. So those are severance related actions with couple of the businesses.
Deane Dray - Citi: Great. And then Brian, I know you can’t names, but your comment about CBORD having a big North East university win. These are always pretty important and especially if you are just placing and incumbent. So maybe just give us a color to the extent that you can regarding the context of the win, what the opportunity was the value that CBORD is bring that the incumbent was not able to provide.
Brian Jellison: I think the -- this is somebody we have been working with for a while and this is a much larger rollout and will normally be the case in terms of the size, which will be apparent when we finally get around announcing it, because its not a small campus environment. And while they see a lot of connectivity point. We continue to grow at the expense as a competitor in this arena and anyone that to close to those market spaces know that we’ve been gaining share and expect to continue to gain share, because our folks are really focused on the space and are compromised with other possible things that this one competition seems to be involved with. So it’s really beneficial, competitive environment if you will for CBORD that they are ceasing on. And we continue to beef up our delivery capability in CBORD and we had a quite a bit of talent in the project management arena. We have promoted somebody into a key role there and we’re quite happy with the way they are focused. I think our new software executive and we have a business development chief architect that can help people think creatively about how to expand their existing product offerings as well. So, I think it’s going to be a long-term continuing contributor to the company.
Deane Dray - Citi: Now, with that this just in terms of timing on that order and would that be in a -- would that be a summer time delivery that’s typically when CBORD does those transactions?
Brian Jellison: Yeah. I think that’s still in our future to determine exactly what the rollout in the implementation schedule will be. Because there are different parts of the CBORD project. There would be the software portion, which of course that’s the large occurring nature to that. And then also in many cases security systems will have installation that have to be schedule around other activity in the campus environment. So, I think the implementation schedule is still in front of us to be able to determine that with the customer.
Deane Dray - Citi: Great. Thank you.
Brian Jellison: You’re welcome, Deane.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take a next question from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan.
Steve Tusa - J.P. Morgan: Hi, good morning.
Brian Jellison: Good morning.
Steve Tusa - J.P. Morgan: Really impressive the margins results, RF Tech up 300 basis points versus last year. Could you just maybe parsed the dynamic there and what drove that?
Brian Jellison: Sure. A couple of different things, one very good tag shipments, which always helps our toll and traffic business, but then also the addition of our and the growth in our software businesses.
Steve Tusa - J.P. Morgan: Right.
Brian Jellison: We have a lot of recurring revenue, but then also come in generally with a little better than the margin performance that our toll and traffic and particularly the projects side of our toll and traffic business. And so with the combination of mix, plus also some costs actions and some other things that we had that we were expensive last year than they are this year. So, we’ve had that tailwind through the first three quarter and expect that to continue in the fourth as well.
Steve Tusa - J.P. Morgan: Europe was down I guess 20% in energy in the second quarter. Can you maybe talk about how those dynamic change in the third quarter. Has there been any kind of change in customer behavior, any problems in financing or credit terms any thing like that?
Brian Jellison: The things we are delivering are not highly expensive. They are really -- we don’t need to think how it was capital items at all. It might be a capital projects that’s driving purchase of the instrumentation software that we sell, but Europe in total for the company not just energy it’s down to 15% of Q3 revenue.
Steve Tusa - J.P. Morgan: Right.
Brian Jellison: So did you ask was this little over 60%? Actually Europe, we include some what other people would call Middle Eastern markets, some of that goes through Europe because of arrangements we have inevitably with some people and absolute number. Probably, John can give better numbers.
John Humphrey: Yeah. Just to check, Steve so as far as energy is concerned just for that segment Europe was actually up almost 10% on organic basis. Remember we do have some OEMs. They are still generally weak on some of the refining in the markets but we have some OEMs there that survey global marketplace. So our destination revenue goes to Europe but their destination revenue were fairly top of that goes all over the world that is continued to be driven by North American and Middle East activity more so than Europe. And so Europe we look at it across the entire company was kind of flat and organic basis versus last year.
Steve Tusa - J.P. Morgan: Right.
John Humphrey: Next headwind of 5% or 6%. So on reported basis, it was down, but you strip out that FX impact. We were kind of the same as last year and we still refining the headwind of course got to find. So our argue would be the Europe was a little bit better than what we saw in the second quarter. Having said that, second quarter was a pretty low part of deal to jump over.
Steve Tusa - J.P. Morgan: Right. And then one last question on the compressor control stuff its been pretty good on LNG related demand and maybe some of the orders do you think I think he said was going to kind of ramp in the fourth quarter, any other kind of details there to help paying more visible picture on what’s going on there?
Brian Jellison: I think I mentioned in the segment commentary the thing its really changing in our compressor control businesses is adding additional of project work. We are getting this very high level of field service which is becoming more of annuity on a continuing basis. And we are way more resources than we ever had to do that. That actually depresses the -- what you perceive as organic growth, of course, because it just normalized in here more like one of our software business. Other than that, we haven’t seen any follow up and what people want to do around compressor control. We continue to have couple of bolt-on acquisitions we did United Controls and Trinity Software that have had -- they could be doing more roles than they have in the past. And I think we’ll some spike up and that will help us to. So we would probably expect little better orders over the next six months than we’ve had in the last six.
Steve Tusa - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Congratulation on a very quarter. Thanks.
Brian Jellison: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Yeah. Good morning. I have just two questions I guess maybe a little bit of follow-up on that last one, but both, what we think it was maybe the shorter turns businesses, the industrial tag and also the energy systems business, just in general had that the book-to-bill in the quarter for both of those business was below one and certainly below a seasonal pickup, seasonal expectation. And is that, is the way you’re thinking about that that the damage was done kind of maybe in month of August and again, short returns businesses where we saw recovery in September?
John Humphrey: Yeah. I think, that’s, I mean, that’s the generally the case, Rick. But also as we look at the book-to-bill ratio inside the company, the major drivers really are project driven business, not the things that we are more book in turn inside of a shorter window. And as you know, we always keep a close eye on some of our, as we think of them our leading indicator businesses, our Struers material test business, our Dynisco business serving a number of process industries, as well as a couple of the other sensor businesses and energy. And those continue to perform well. Their book-to-bill ratio was solid in the quarter and again, I mean, August was tough, but September was better for them. So, I think that that commentary that Brian was talking about is largely around the book and ship businesses and we have the project timing things that will overlay against that.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Okay. And then just one follow -- my follow-up. There was some -- I think Brian you had mentioned that there was some project activity in the RF Tech segment that was pushed from maybe the second half of this year into the first half of next year. Is it -- where did that fall, was that the tolling business or where is that?
Brian Jellison: Yeah. Our total stuff in Texas, we had a very large contract that we won in the second quarter and we expect that we would have been doing some delivery by now and there are some things going on with tolling authority that are moving things around and they are not ready for delivery yet. So that’s getting pushed out to probably, I don’t know, first quarter of next year. A tiny chance we might get a little bit out here in the fourth quarter, but we are assuming it’s one of the 2013, it actually give benefit to us because…
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Okay.
Brian Jellison: … it helps like any fall off that might occur in 2013 and some of these other areas.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: And the push out, I think you had mentioned $5 million to $10 million, is that kind of an annualize number or are we suggesting that was pushed out of the back half for this year?
Brian Jellison: We worked opposite. This is just locked. When we were preparing our guidance for the third quarter, we were thinking we’ll get $5 million to $10 million out of this particular project and we didn’t get anything that we could offer.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: I see. Okay. Thank you. Thanks for the clarification. 
Brian Jellison: That’s why we are not at all worried about our book-to-bill, its 9…
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Thanks. Good morning. Heard the comments on tolling being a little stronger next year, but just trying to think about how to frame up the segment in our longer-term. It looks like maybe the traffic and tolling side is kind of a flat line business. You get some growth out of the software side. So it kind of low growth longer-term but a margin melt-up on mix shift. Is that, anything wrong with that thinking?
Brian Jellison: I mean, if that’s what happens, then you are right with respect to the margin benefit. I’m not at all going where you are as far as toll and traffic been a flat business. I think they have a lot of opportunities in front of them. They have the number of solutions that they continue to deploy. People around the world are looking for ways to reduce congestion and generate revenue from their existing infrastructure. I think that the trends in their business are favorable. It’s not all the question of whether austerity overwhelms that, but I don’t think it does. So, I’m not going where you are as far as it being a flat business.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Yeah. I wasn’t necessarily there. Just wanted to bounce that up that was very helpful. And then on the regions, John, did the U.S. deviated all from the monthly trends that you talked about?
John Humphrey: Not materially but straight to mind, no.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc: Good morning. Brian, you mentioned some dynamics with China, Japan and Taiwan. Can you talk a little bit more about them and specifically, how it’s impacting your business or how you expected to impact your business?
Brian Jellison: Well, it’s really in -- more in academic and research arena where we have almost, a lot of our sales ultimately are going to China, but through Japanese and Taiwanese distribution or technology companies. Certainly the political situation that has escalated on the rhetoric basis between Japanese and Chinese less than helpful for people. So we are -- we were curious as to whether that’s going to get resolved anytime soon, but doesn’t it -- it makes us a little more cautious about some of our end markets in particular area. But remember, Matt, as you know, I mean, it’s a very small part of the overall company. But we do like to point out things that seem to be trend changes and that is a something we had not heard prior to the third quarter from people that I think are insightful. So kind of just alluring you that it could be a headwind.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc: Got it. And then I wanted to spend just a moment on your CCC business. It sounds like you have excellent visibility there. So please, I mean, first, correct me, even if I’m working in thinking that? And then, I want to make sure, I understand, what dictates kind of the momentum and timing around your field service activity? And is this a business that is going to require some incremental internal investment near-term?
Brian Jellison: It doesn’t really need if its people related. So it’s just a matter of, we have seen an opportunity to expand our field service business for a lot of reasons. The people want to focus on capital equipment, which is very lumpy and they are leaving behind an opportunity to give out field service in this area, which we are picking out at a fast pace. So that requires a little bit of investment for people, but not massive one. They are expensive people because of where they are physically located. And then in terms of the order processes, they are always lumpy in CCC. There is not anything you can do about that, people order their technology from us with a long lead time. So it’s not unusual to get an 18-month out order, we only book things that are shippable within 12 months. So we don’t create a massive backlog and stuff that isn’t going to hit our next forward 12 months of activity. And we have a very strong knowledge about who we are working with in various CCC projects and what the likely outcome is going to be. Those tend not to be so much what equity projects. I mean you are kind of working with somebody from a design viewpoint where you’ll likely get the order, we would not lose many orders that we are involved with.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc: And then, just lastly one quick one. Captures decision to open source their technology and does that do anything to the tolling space at all?
John Humphrey: No. We think that’s a change versus the statistical. I mean those are, I believe our understanding of that is, it’s a number of patterns that have already expired and frankly, we’ve been on the leading edge of and also a lot of these interoperable solutions. We are the first people to and TransCore who were the first people to introduce multi-protocol readers. So, a tolling authority could have the opportunity of having their choice of the best tag technology and we would be believe to read any ones available. So, I don’t think that that recent announcement really effects the competitive dynamic. I think it’s just a reflection of today’s environment already.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc: All right. Thanks, John. I’m sorry…
Brian Jellison: I think, these are the strength of our business.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc: Appreciate that. Thanks, Brian. Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next to Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: Good morning.
Brian Jellison: Hey, Brian.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: I wanted to ask what’s your GAAP estimate would be for the fourth quarter? You got a $1.43, $1.49 for the non-GAAP?
Brian Jellison: Yeah. And the…
John Humphrey: The difference is the deferred revenue is probably…
Brian Jellison: It’s a $0.04 difference.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: $0.04 below that. Okay. So we can calculate…
Brian Jellison: Yeah. That’s exactly. That $0.04 is related to the deferred revenue fair value adjustment as revenue out of the acquisition we would have recorded.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: Yeah. Okay. I was away from the call for a minute. So I don’t know if this was asked but you mentioned in your opening remarks that August dipped down a bit and you were concerned and then things strengthened. What’s the reason for that? That’s an odd fluctuation.
Brian Jellison: I think August was an aberration. When you scoop it out, the third quarter was maybe 2% below what we would have outpouring. We actually know that that was more project oriented. But in the middle of the quarter, we were apprehensive because we don’t want -- maybe there is some kind of falloff and we have really seen that. So we’re kind of back to a reasonable September and a reasonable July.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: There’s been an economic fall off since then as pretty dramatic going into the fourth quarter here with a lot of companies reporting weakness and things below expectations. Did you experience that apparently in August and then recovered some of that debts?
Brian Jellison: Remember, this is only a few of our businesses are going to bounce around like that. I mean, the medical businesses that are more secular in nature, most of are up other than the lumpy side of the projects. It’s pretty secular in nature with growth. So if you have a falloff in industrial energy, it’s almost always rebounds in the fourth quarter in energy. Any way, we’ll have a lot of things that people would want to invest in with them on budgets and other arenas.
John Humphrey: And Alex, few other thing I would add to that is that we don’t report -- there are some companies that actually report their quarter of their activity on a monthly basis because they really are better gauge and more type to near-term macro economic activity. That’s never really been our business profile. So we’re not really a good indicator for the macro world because of the niche markets that we serve and many of the things that have the secular growth tailwinds that I was talking about. So I think the -- other reason that we mentioned it was a little bit different than what we normally see but we’re not looking at month-to-month activity or week-to-week activity. We’re not that type of macro business.
Alex Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: Right. I realize that and in looking at next year, well right now investment is lagging. Investors are really on strike, capital goods investment I’m talking about could even be down here in the fourth…
John Humphrey: Hello.
Operator: Mr. Blanton. Looks like his -- he disconnected his line.
Brian Jellison: Alex, we’ll follow up with you later on today.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Thank you. And thank you all for joining us this morning and as always, we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Roper Industries’ Second Quarter 2012 Financial Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
John Humphrey: Thank you and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our second quarter. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; Jason Conley, Head of Planning and Investor Relations for us. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today’s call. We prepared slides to accompany today’s call, which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com. Now, if you turn to slide two, we begin with our updated Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today’s call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You should listen to today’s call in the context of that information. Now, if you please turn to slide three, I’ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. And after his prepared remarks, we’ll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: Well, good morning everybody. Today, we’ll go through the enterprise financial results for the quarter, talk a little bit about specific segment detail on the outlook for each of the segments, give you an overview of the Sunquest acquisition, and then established our third quarter and full year guidance and take your questions. I think we had indicated in our first quarter call that we expected going into the second quarter would be our most difficult challenge for the year. We had really an outstanding quarter compared to what we expected, because we had quite a few headwinds this quarter. I’ve certainly had the uncertain economy and we’re able to blow through that. We had very difficult comps going into Q2, because of the Gaz de France. Revenue last year and outsized performance in toll tag shipments last year in our Gatan technology business that we knew wouldn’t be repeated. And then of course, we had currency which became a bigger surprise and we expect it cost us about a $0.01 a share versus our guidance and about $0.02 a share versus the prior year. That said let’s look at what we did in Q2, next slide. We had record results in the second quarter, pretty well across the board, the highest level of orders in our history, highest level of sales in our history in the second quarter, biggest backlog that we’ve entered the second quarter with record net earnings and record EBITDA performance for the quarter. Our orders were up 8% and revenue was up 4% despite those headwinds and the effect of currency. Our book-to-bill ratio was actually quite high at 1.05%. Our gross margins reached 54.9% in the quarter and our operating margin was really quite spectacular, it came up 130 basis points to 24.7%. If you look at the incremental OP and the incremental sales, our operating leverage in the quarter was 59%. And there is no smoke and mirrors in that, it’s just 59%. Our EBITDA was up $214 million – sorry, was $214 million and our EBITDA margin reached 29.5%. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $119 million, slightly lower than we would expect in the second quarter, but we had a higher cash tax rate and that would happen again in the rest of the year. Our first half operating cash flow was $261 million and we’ll project what we believe will be for the full year later this morning. Our diluted earnings per share were $1.15 versus a $1.03 last year, that $1.15 would have been $0.01 higher based on our guidance if it weren’t for the currency scenario, and the $1.03 is the number that we use with the re-measurement gain last year, you might remember, was about $0.05 a share, so on GAAP, it would have been $1.08, but was really adjusted at $1.03. Net earnings were up 13%. We’re very happy with the performance, because we had about a $30 million headwind between our scientific camera business and Gaz de France and some European activity coming into the quarter and we were able to really blow through that, very solid revenue throughout the world with the exception in Europe, which was down about 18%. Record performance really in an uncertain economic environment. Next slide, in the Q2 income statement, you’ll see orders over $763 million, up 7% organically. Revenue, book-to-bill came in at 1.05%, gross profit was up 100 basis points to 54.9% from 53.9% a year ago and our operating income was an amazing 24.7%, up 130 basis points for a year ago. Our interest expense about flat, tax rate was consistent with the guidance we established for the quarter came in at 29.6%. And net earnings were $115 million versus $102 last year, up 13%. Next slide, if we look at our EBITDA performance, our trailing 12 months EBITDA has now reached $845 million, it’s up from last year’s trailing number this time at $739 million and two years ago $540 million. So, EBITDA is up 57% over the last two years and our EBITDA margins continued to soar, we were 25.2% in 2010 and 29.3% on the trailing 12 months calculation now and of course this quarter at 29.5%. Next, if we look here at the cash flow performance, you’ll see Q2 cash flow at $119 million of operating cash flow and $109 million of free cash flow, very good performance again in working capital. Our inventory actually improved by 30 basis points from 7.5% to 7.2% of revenue and our accounts receivable improved by 50 basis points from 15.6% to 15.1%. And when you adjust that for payables and accruals, we were still below 7%. In the first half cash flow, normally our first half cash flow is about 40% of the full year. This year it’ll – second half will be even a little stronger because of the acquisition of Sunquest and how cash accretive it really is. So, you can see that our full year operating cash flow, we’ve now raised our guidance to be about $700 million for the full year, that’ll clear operating cash flow at a very high percentage of revenue it could reach 23% of revenue in fact. It’s really driven by expanded margins. It’s driven by the Sunquest acquisition that we expect to close in the last four months of the year. And some cash tax benefits that we’re acquiring in the Sunquest transaction. It does exclude the deal cost and refinancing charges associated with the new credit facility we’ve put in place effective this past Friday. And you can see here that free cash flow, operating cash flow goes up to $700 million. Our estimate this year up from $602 million last year and $500 million the year before, so that would be 40% increase in cash flow over the last two years. Next slide, on Friday we closed a new credit facility of $1.5 billion revolver. So, if you look at our normal credit stats here a year ago on June 30, 2011, you can see that we had $196 million in cash and $595 million in un-drawn revolver which gave us acquisition powder and investment powder of about $791 million. When we closed out the quarter on June 30, our cash had increased to $519 million on our un-drawn revolver was at its capacity at $750 million giving us $1.269 billion. As of Friday with the new $1.5 billion revolver and the cash from the end of the quarter, we now have capacity in excess of $2 billion. Our gross debt on the other hand is only $1.69 billion. Our gross debt-to-capitalization is at 23.8, but if you look at the net debt-to-EBITDA you will see it’s actually been cut in half a year ago was 1.4 and at the end of the quarter it was 0.7. Even with the financing of the Sunquest acquisition at $1.4 billion, we’ll have ample capacity to pursue other opportunities in the near term and now the pipeline remains very, very exciting. If we look next slide here at the Sunquest details – sorry the segment details, we’ll start with the RF technology slide next. So, on RF technology, really very, very outstanding orders in the quarter, they were up 18%. So, those orders and the execution really in the toll and traffic business kind of got us up to the high-end of our range despite the European pressures and help us deliver. You can see the OP margin was amazing at 27%, up 290 basis points and if you want to look at leverage, revenue was down 2% and operating profit was up 10%. So, that would speak strongly to the execution, that’s occurring in those businesses. The software businesses continue to help us on the margin expansion as they grow. We got a very significant win again in Houston. We are going to upgrade the entire lane hardware in the Houston area with our United Toll Systems technology, which is really an advancement over what was in place in the past. We think that contract order produced about $65 million in revenue between maintenance and the change out. Our CBORD cashless system business continued to grow. It had a record quarter in the second quarter for anytime and that involved both university and food management wins in both higher education and healthcare. And we had, of course, this difficult headwind for our technology business, Gaz de France, which had that sort of a one-time large install last year and that held us back by about $5 million in the quarter. In the second half, we’ll have the continued difficult comp with the Gaz de France, because it went throughout the year or last year. But our increased toll project and maintenance activity that will be led by this – these Texas wins will easily offset any challenges we have in the rest of those types of activities in the segment. And then the software businesses and software-as-a-service activity is continuing to increase and both iTrade and freight matching continue to roll along with the sort of nominal organic growth, but outstanding cash growth. Next slide, if we look at the Industrial Technology segment, here just again spectacular performance there. Revenue was up 11%. The operating profit margins reached 30.4%, that’s an all-time record for the segment. The highest previous we ever had was a 29.2% in the fourth quarter of last year, this 30.4% to just add some perspective around how amazing it is, the S&P 500 Industrials gross margins as a group were 30.8%. Roper’s operating profit for Industrial is 30.4%. So, we got an all-time record here in OP margin – again, leverage off the growth, terrific execution everywhere. Food handling continues to grow in both agricultural food and the shale activity. Our general industrial markets have performed well. We are not seeing any early indicators of any softness on any of those businesses. The material test business, which is primarily a European business actually had a record second quarter, very strong North America and Asia sales offset any weakness that we had in Europe. The Neptune business continued to grow, driven by the Toronto project and some higher shipments in the U.S. In the second half of the year, we would expect that the shale activity growth would moderate, not stall, but certainly moderate with gas activity on shale being down, but the oil activity on shale being up. The industrial end-markets again no signs of any fall off. The outstanding margins we expect to continue throughout the second half of the year, and just a personal note to all our people in Industrial, we just couldn’t be more proud of these teams as we watch them execute in a very tough market. Next slide, we look at our Energy Systems and Controls business, here you can see revenue was up 6%, OP up 7%, margin at 26%, was up 200 basis points from the first quarter margin in energy. Organic growth in the quarter was 5%. Compressor controls continues to do very well on LNG projects and the field service activity that we do drove double-digit growth for them. The bolt-on acquisitions that we did in the last are very small United Control Group, Trinity, and Cambridge. All have non-cash amortization charges in them. They are actually putting a little bit of a drag on the OP margins, even though at 26%, it’s hard to see a drag, but they actually would have been about 120 basis points higher on OP without a lot of amortization drag and integration on those three businesses. That said, they are performing well, they are all on plan from an integration view point, they will add the growth in the second half of the year. Our European markets weakened, in fact in the energy they were down about 18%, but our U.S. was up by about 18%. So, they – U.S. business being larger that was a benefit and the rest of the world was quite strong in the Middle East, and Asia, Australia, Brazil not quite as strong. Our targeted cost actions are underway for the second half on a very selected basis for people who are executing some contingency plans in those things that relate to any softness that they see. We think Europe continued to be soft, but we’ll have continued growth in both North America and Middle East and Asia to offset that. With the exception of our Petrochem business which was down about 20% and that’s a worldwide shortfall. We’re not seeing any strength anywhere in that business. Very solid backlog though compressor controls gives us confidence of that growth in the second half and then we would expect normal very strong Q4 seasonal activity in energy would be repeated this year. Next slide, so here we’ll look at Medical and Scientific Imaging. This is one of those things where it looks like nothing happened, but there is great variability throughout the different businesses here and while revenue was flat and operating margin was up 20 bps. What really was going on is the Europe and the North American academic resource funding softness impacted our camera portion of the Photonics business, as cameras are not a big part of Roper, but they do come in around $125 million to $140 million worth of total revenue. And they were down as much as 20% in some cases. And we don’t see any real turnaround as it relates to those research markets for the camera technology businesses. And while we perform relatively well there is certainly a drag on the short-term growth. Our medical businesses continued to grow organically. The channel expansion we’ve been able to provide them in Asia is offsetting any weakness that they have in Europe. And the Northern Digital business performed very well expanding its offerings to OEM customers. And also we were able to do a Bolt-on acquisition in the quarter, called Ascension Technology Corporation, which is in upstate Vermont. And Ascension does 3D tracking for minimally invasive surgery which you probably all know is a rapidly growing aspect in surgical applications. We paid about $18 million for Ascension, we expected to deliver $3 million plus in EBITDA over the next 12 months. In the second half, we expect to have continued weakness in this academic research area, which will affect our Photonics businesses. Fortunately, the medical expansion is going to continue, our markets remain pretty favorable. Ascension will give us a little bit of gross work for Northern Digital. The Gatan business has a substantial backlog, which we expect to be able to shift during the second half of the year which will add to our growth. And then we have this transformational Sunquest acquisition which will add substantial amount of revenue and EBITDA to our medical platform. We would expect it will add somewhere in the neighborhood of $75 million of revenue in the last four months of the year. It’s going to add well over 35% to the Medical and Scientific segment for the next year in revenue. It’s going to add quite a substantial amount to the Roper’s overall revenue base for 2013. Next slide, so as we look at the Sunquest acquisition, I’ll talk a bit about the transaction and John will talk a little more in depth about the specific business. Next slide, so if we look at the Sunquest acquisition, you can see that it meets all of our acquisition criteria, it’s really an amazing fit where we are able to take our software platforms inside RF and the medical platforms inside Medical and Scientific imaging and hook them up in a very creative way with the Sunquest business, which is truly a software business, but it’s also a medical business. If you look at our criteria, we talk about all the time asset like low CapEx absolutely, it’s almost no CapEx and exceptionally light asset business. Focusing on the market structures and driving forces at work, we’ve done probably more marketplace diligence on this business because we actually looked at it in 2010 and have maintained 100% of business forever and really felt that based on the work that we have done and things that we thought they could and should be looking at and then seeing how they’ve done. Our diligence revealed a lot of strategic competitive advantages that Sunquest enjoys and they have a lot of wide space opportunities for growth that are beyond their core traditional business. They’ve done a great job in transforming their business that was acquired by Vista in 2007 and certainly was high margin business, but could be better and to the Sunquest leadership team’s efforts, they have done an incredible job in making that a transformational business that we are acquiring now compared to what it was in 2007. The incentives as always are linked to the commitments that their leadership teams made and those are in place. It has technology advantages that are clear and easily measured against competition and has very deep application expertise. It really is a niche business in the lab market. Management continuity as always is valued, and everybody on that team has agreed to stay in place. The communication for the Sunquest employees is taking place this morning in Tucson. We’ve asked them as always to preserve what’s made them a very good company in core values, but stimulate progress. In this area, the progress is going to come in the form of even more investment in the sales and marketing arena and some faster execution in the development area. This is a business that when we talk about growing what you buy, my goodness, this business has higher margins than been we do. It has twice the EBITDA margins that Roper enjoys. And when you look at those kind of margins and you recognize the incredible strength of the company, it has two-thirds of its revenue comes on a recurring basis. 98% of its customers sign up annually for the software programs that it has. It has negative working capital and very low CapEx and we expect in 2013 that it will generate $140 million or more EBITDA for us. The fourth quarter run-rate, which we just completed their fiscal company May 31st and just had their audit and signed up prior to our closing actually supports our expectations for ‘13 – 2013 nicely. It’s really a business when John talks about, if you want to kind of think about well, what do they do and where are they located and why did they win, because it is a phenomenal management team and outstanding group of employees that have really done things in the space that no one can really replicate. So, with that, we’ll turn into next slide and John Humphrey.
John Humphrey: Sure. Thanks, Brian. So, I’ll just talk a little bit more about kind of what Sunquest is and what it’s able to provide for its customers. Those are the global market leaders for providing the underlying software and information solution for laboratories and hospitals and large academic medical centers, with a headquarter in Tucson, Arizona, locations both in the UK and a development center in Bangalore. They have a global footprint that allows them to serve that customer base, really, their customer base are those folks who – for whom the effectiveness and efficiency of the lab is of critical importance. The lab ends up with in many cases hundreds of thousands of tests being done each month to support the diagnostic decisions that are made in a hospital. And they rely upon the Sunquest information and the quality and safety associated with that to help drive those decisions. The comprehensive solutions is about improving the productivity with workflow automation tools, you see on the right hand side both the Sunquest laboratory 7.0 and the CoPath solution. Both of those are about workflow automation to make sure that the right test is done on the right patient at the right time, leading to the right diagnosis. So, those things also reach beyond just the lab and also go out to the collection manager, which is one of the modules that Sunquest has. So, that nurse has a point of collection tool that integrates back with the lab, so you have full connectivity between both of those parts of the hospital. The very large customer base, very high retention rates, over 98% retention each year, continue to utilize and depend upon the software set of solutions and fully supported by a 30-year history. And these are very long-term relationships, relationships that are supported by the decades of application expertise. The Sunquest has developed about what the hospital lab needs and their unique set of needs that Sunquest is going to be able to meet. And as Brian talked about, it is a proven team, it’s a great culture everything that we’ve learned during the diligence process continues to support the fact that their culture of excellence of execution is really phenomenal and I think they’re going to be a great addition to the team. And I think the company is very well-positioned to capture the growth opportunities that they’ve identified over the coming years. So, with that I’ll turn it back to Brian to talk a little bit about guidance and summary for the quarter.
Brian Jellison: Okay. So, after we get that title sheet on guidance, we’ll move to the guidance slide. We’ve raised our full-year guidance to $4.84 to $5 that reflects about a $0.04 reduction due to currency. We had started out at $4.75 to $4.91, you might remember. $0.04 comes off the bottom here, $0.0471 or $0.05 off the top here for 86 and we’re adding back $0.12 to $0.14 on a GAAP accretion for Sunquest excluding any of the deal cost. And then in addition of course we’ve got other things that we’re absorbing and other things that are good. So $4.84 to $5 on full-year guidance, the quarter comes in at $1.19 to $1.25 in the third quarter. Most importantly really is that we now expect our full-year operating cash flow to be approximately $700 million. And just a couple of footnotes you’ll notice there, the acquisition of Sunquest, we expect to close at the end of August will have the HSR filing and since there is no competitive issues, it should move along quickly. We have some deferred revenue that’s unusual in Sunquest, similar to some other businesses when you acquire them there are some GAAP issues around that. And so we’ll have to kind of reveal that huge quarter as we report out. And this does exclude whatever cost we will have that will be registered in the third quarter that would be related to the acquisition and removal of the remaining amortization and the old revolver. Next slide, so looking at the summary of the second quarter, we go back to the top point being that it’s again an all-time record for any second quarter in our history, highest level of orders, revenue backlog, net earnings and EBITDA. Organic order growth at 7% was really a pleasant benefit for the quarter, the operating margins at 24.7%, the EBITDA, 29.5%, and gross margins at 54.9%, really terrific. Leverage is kind of breathtaking at 59%. We used to talk about 30% to 35% of leverage and it’s hard to see how our leverage isn’t going to be above 40% for a long time. Doing a new revolver, big help, $1.5 billion as the older revolver was put in place in July of 2008 and would have the deal replaced in July of 2013. So, this removes any refinancing risk around that for next year. It gives us twice as much capacity to write checks against as we had previously and $1.5 billion is pretty sizable revolver for Roper. That was completed last Friday, a timely completion we might add relative to the deal closing on Saturday. Sunquest, just an exceptional financial profile, higher gross margins than we have twice the EBITDA margins. Terrific that you couldn’t find a business that’s sort of marry what we’re doing in software and what we’re doing in Medical that would benefit both so much as Sunquest. It’s got a great development people. Our software people spent last week in Bangalore, visiting and talking with people. We’ve done tremendous diligence around the robustness of the software platforms in place for Sunquest and how they can be used. All of this then creates an opportunity for us to be positioned again in 2012 for an all-time record year. $700 million in operating cash flow and perhaps most importantly that a transformation process that we’re doing here continues as we get more and more technology. You think about where we are now, we’ve continued this. We’ve more technology content, we have higher margins, higher cash returns, more recurring revenue and it’s just a much different company than what you’d looked at 2002. And in the next five years, we added Neptune and TransCore. And then if you look at 2007 and you look at the forward five years here till 2012 you’ve picked up Seaboard and Horizon and I-Trade, and Technolog and now Sunquest. So, the technology content gets better margins, get better cash return, gets better and available forward acquisition power for growth will be better than it ever has been in the past. And with that, I think we’re ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. (Operator Instructions) We’ll go first to Matt Summerville, KeyBanc.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: Good morning.
Brian Jellison: Hey, good morning Matt.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: I just wanted to clarify something Brian on Sunquest, a $0.12 to $0.14 is that a GAAP number that we’ll have under GAAP rules, the deferred revenue adjustments, I just want to make sure I have that right?
John Humphrey: That is a – Matt, this is John. That’s a non-GAAP number. So, as you are probably aware like an awful lot of software companies, Sunquest has deferred revenue for the annual maintenance. They get paid in advance for that.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: Sure.
John Humphrey: And the accounting rules upon acquisition will require us to take a write-down of that. So, to basically move that deferred revenue to fair value and then over the next 12 months as those renewals happen, that deferred revenue will get built back up. So, the $0.12 to $0.14 is a non-GAAP number. And as we are able to estimate exactly what that deferred revenue fair value adjustment is, then we’ll be able to provide that for you. We will be able to do that until after we closed the business, but we’ll be providing that insight each quarter. So, you are able to reconcile between the GAAP numbers and then the non-GAAP numbers that we think provide better visibility in understanding the operations of the company.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: Perfect.
Brian Jellison: The great news though is the cash is the cash.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: Absolutely. Brian, could you maybe spend a minute talking about just more broadly for Roper’s, you moved through Q2, how would you characterize the overall demand environment for your businesses and then how are orders so far in July from what you’ve seen?
Brian Jellison: I think really the quarter from our organic – we wouldn’t have given ourselves so much of a shot that had been 7% organic. Orders in the quarter that was a pleasant surprise, but we got really strong activity that we knew we’d eventually come in the year wouldn’t have necessarily seen in the quarter, so that helped. I think we entered the quarter with more concern and turned out to be justified. So, those any like early indicators of things that would make us nervous, that would be in energy or industrial, we really haven’t seen that. There is just a little bit of activity mostly in petrochem and oil and gas that we are going to do some very modest internal retrenchment all in, but on balance, it’s pretty good. We never really talk about a quarter in which we’re in, but I would say, things remain pretty decent. We’re going to expect organic growth that actually kind of picked up in the second quarter and we would expect it to continue to be mid-single digits really for the rest of the year. So, it’s really kind of better than we expect, because there is more European headwinds than we would have originally forecast.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: How much was your European business down in the quarter?
Brian Jellison: It was down 18% for us in total, about a half of that is just due to currency though, so maybe 8% or 9% on an organic basis.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: Great. Thanks a lot guys.
John Humphrey: One thing to remember on that Matt is that does include the headwind associated with Gaz de France, so that’s got $5 million, but even once you take that out, we saw a decline in Europe that was definitely mid-single digits.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: Got it. Thanks John.
John Humphrey: Sure.
Operator: We’ll go next to Mark Douglass, Longbow Research.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Hello. Good morning.
Brian Jellison: Hey good morning, Mark.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: So, on the Sunquest, Brian, you talked about there is a lot of wide space, you talk about what that would look like, I mean is it market share shift, is it just under-penetrated as far as the clinics and hospitals or is it geographies?
Brian Jellison: Well, I think we don’t want to tip off other people to things that we think are available to us, but it would be safe to say that we think that they can continue to grow share at the expense of other people. We think people have been paying a lot of attention to electronic health records and companies that are in the EHR space. Here again, we picked out a niche that we think is unrelated to that activity. And this niche has got an opportunity, very high return for people investing in this in the hospital space and in the clinic space and in private care space. Basically the lab work is critical to every aspects of people, diagnosing folks and it happens at a variety of different places. We think we have the pre-eminent technology to do that. And we think we can make people more productive and more efficient in what they do when they do it. It has been hard, I think the last couple of years to get the attention, hospitals that have had these mandates to do a variety of thing around health records, now they get a chance to make an investment and things like this business that will give them an actual return. So, we think it’s got pretty exciting growth. And these guys they brought in a new sales executive women in who we have great confidence in that we think it’s going to drive better focus on organic growth, it’s been a very high cash contributor. And it’s same old situation, private equity has done in this case of a really amazing job with this business versus what they acquired in ‘07, but it can grow one and it has – it does have opportunities for share gain and expansion around the world. I mean this business it doesn't do much in certain portions as the world and we do a lot in other portions of the world that they do. It’s also got an incredible development team in Bangalore and that's very, very bullish for us.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Okay and then want to give too much away on them I suppose, what are this for the industries at least typically growth rates, what kind of returns are you assuming as you model it out over the next three to five years?
Brian Jellison: For a Sunquest kind of thing?
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Yes.
Brian Jellison: Oh, I think it ought to – it will grow its cash and EBITDA double-digits. Revenue, just kind of year forward revenue is probably go to work by 10%. We would think over time that it grows revenue, remember it’s got this massive recurring business right. So, in fact new business won’t look like a high number. So, if you have got couple of hundred million of constant business, it could grow its net new business by 20% and it wouldn’t look like a big number on the core business, right. So, it’s not like looking at a cyclical company that’s up and down and looking at various trends. This is just as it starts with its Q4 and then each quarter it gets better all the time.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Deane Dray, Citi Research.
Deane Dray – Citi Research: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
Brian Jellison: Hey good morning.
Deane Dray – Citi Research: Brian, I’d be interested in hearing what the lessons you’ve learnt from iTrade and how that played into both the negotiation for Sunquest, but also integration, managing a software company and so forth?
Brian Jellison: We have a big advantage today versus when we first took on iTrade in that we have recently hired a Chief Architect for our technology businesses. He is working in our software arena. We also have a software executive full time that’s looking over a various software companies. And we have a medical executive which we didn’t have before looking over the medial scenarios. So, between the two new executives, someone that’s a domain expert in medical and one that’s a domain expert in software and the architectural person, the quality of our diligence that we’re able to do on our own was a dramatic improvement. We have a much deeper understanding about source code and the ways in which development programs need to be done and measured. And we’ve got a deeper understanding about cost structures around development activity. And all those things were good. I think we’ve also come to recognize that slightly lower organic growth rates in the software businesses really aren’t a problem because of the recurring revenue that they have inside them and the quality of the cash that they generate. I mean to look at a company I think most people would look at us and say this is best-of-breed EBITDA margins and yet here we’re acquiring one that has twice the margins that we enjoy. So, they were fundamentally different and our executive leadership capability around them is better than ever.
Deane Dray – Citi Research: And just to clarify on the deferred revenues, you said that it refers to the maintenance side of it, is that two years it’s pretty typical that you’re seeing three years of maintenance fees and are any of the licensing fees included in that deferred revenues or just maintenance?
John Humphrey: So, the short answer is nothing on the license fees and the maintenance contracts and the differed revenue are two slightly different things. So, the maintenance agreements range anywhere from one-year, three-year, five-year, some of them even seven-year agreements because of course the customer would like to make sure that they have kind of the long-term commitment with Sunquest. And Sunquest might have in the long-term contracts so, but they don’t pay for all seven years or all five years upfront. So it’s a one-year payment and that’s what goes into the differed revenue so, we would expect to see that differed revenue build backup after the fair value adjustment after 12 months to be back to the normal steady state.
Deane Dray – Citi Research: Great, just last one from me on the $25 million in cash tax benefits, well, what’s the duration of that asset, will it be used up first year or are you restricted in how much you can draw down.
John Humphrey: We will be utilizing that in 2012.
Deane Dray – Citi Research: Great, thank you and congratulations.
John Humphrey: Alright.
Operator: We will go next to Terry Darling, Goldman Sachs.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Good morning.
Brian Jellison: Hey, good morning, Terry.
John Humphrey: Good morning, Terry.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: And congratulations on Sunquest.
Brian Jellison: Thank you.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: So couple of follow-ups there, in terms of thinking about accretion for 2013, any reason not to on a non-GAAP basis as you are presenting it here, $0.13 for four months, 10% plus revenue growth profile, anything outside the scope of that as we annualize those numbers that we ought to be aware off.
Brian Jellison: Notably so. Just to remember on the growth profile that you want to be careful on the revenue growth profile, you are going to have that massive baseline, so it’s just the net new that grows, right. So, we will have a double-digit organic growth on the non-recurring revenue side and we will have double-digit EBITDA growth.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Okay, that is helpful. And then the interest rate on the new revolver, John, do you have that.
John Humphrey: Yeah, we do. It’s basically the same as what we have now on a drawn basis, the jump was 125, the facility fee is 15 basis points so, the un-drawn portion is 15 bps.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then in terms of the changes in the outlook for 2012 on the base business, Brian, you had called out that there were some minuses offset by some pluses and all that kind of rounded to where you were before. But I’m wondering if you can just kind of go through the list here on both the plus and the minus side, you have been very clear on the energy piece with the petrochem and oil and gas component. The RF margins look a little stronger, perhaps that’s a plus up the industrial margins, perhaps that’s a plus up the RF Europe. On the technology side, you call that as a negative, am I missing any of the other pieces within that context.
Brian Jellison: I would say that it’s probably only one you might have missed is that the camera business is specifically that are serving the academic research markets probably a little bit worse than even what we had handicapped three months ago. So seeing them down kind of in the high-teens in the second quarter and frankly not a lot of encouraging signs in there in the market as we look forward to the third quarter, probably a little bit of incremental headwind. But once again offset by some of the pluses that we have seen in RF and some of the better margin performance.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then in terms of the second half for organic growth in the mid single-digits, you are much tougher comp obviously in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. Do you expect mid singles for both quarters or would that comp profile suggest a little tougher 3Q.
Brian Jellison: Probably similar throughout the second half.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. And then just lastly, can you help us with what iTrade organic was in the quarter, presumably with the Europe comment that might have been down. But can you just clarify on that for us.
Brian Jellison: No iTrade was up organically in the quarter.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator: We’ll go next to Christopher Glynn, Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Thanks, good morning.
Brian Jellison: Good morning.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: On the RF order, they were pretty striking, I think you called up some new strength in toll and traffic, I don’t know if that was mainly related to Houston. But any signs you are entering sort of a new era of growth for that business and brought interest on the road conversion.
Brian Jellison: Well, you are happy to find new era. So, it’s the one big area that’s alive and well for those activities. There are a lot of initiatives. There are a number of things that’ll come out for bid. I think the longer we go with people learning more and more about our United Toll Systems technology, the more and more people recognize that it is dramatically superior to what other people have done for a long period of time including ourselves. So, the lead time for getting agencies to understand and see and test and kick tires around that is kind of long. But in terms of long-term growth vehicle, nobody’s got a better mouse trap than us and I don’t think anybody is going to get one. So, we like the long-term nature of the business and we certainly like the second quarter and we think the rest of the year will be fine.
John Humphrey: And just to put a little more color on that Chris, for instance the win in Harris County is not a conversion from a non-tolled to a tolled lane or a new road is being constructed. It’s really an upgrade of the technology and so it’s a technology insertion and maintenance for the equipment that’s already on those roads. So, it’s really just building out our maintenance and support capabilities with the team that we have rather than net new if you will.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Understood and then on Neptune, wondering if you’re starting to see an impact on new resi and how you think about the opportunity for residential recovery on the Neptune business if you could contextualize that a little bit?
Brian Jellison: Well, if that happens it’ll be great. I mean getting 700,000 housing starts is better than 400,000. It’s not as good against getting a million for. So, we’re hopeful and I wouldn’t say much if anything is baked into our guidance around stronger housing start thing. But if it happens, that will definitely – we would think that certainly benefit us in 2013.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Great, thanks.
Operator: We’ll go next to Richard Eastman, Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Yes. Good morning. Brian, could you just speak for a minute or two about the RF segment EBIT, significant jump in the quarter on the growth rate that was slightly negative. Is that – first of all is that mix or secondly is that and maybe also was that sustainable at that level as we move forward?
Brian Jellison: It’s very sustainable, here one of the things Richard you might note, if you want to get in trouble at Roper, you come in from operations and you say well we had a mix variance. Okay, so we know exactly where it came from in every one of the businesses and certainly we have tightened up our execution in the TransCore toll business and have better margins as a result of that activity which has showed out terrific work that’s been done really by George McGraw, our Amtech business and some work that’s been done in IPS business. That said software tends to grow at a faster cliff than our friends do and the rest of the product measure of RF and as it grows it carries with an extraordinary margins compared to the product businesses.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: So again, given where we booked backlog if it’s partly Houston and it’s been on the tolling side, we can expand that business in the second half off of this 27% EBIT margin?
Brian Jellison: I think that’s – I wouldn’t do that if I were in your shoes, I’ll put it that way. I mean we have…
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird:  Which is up in my shoes, so that’s not a good assumption.
John Humphrey: No, I don’t believe so. So, I mean clearly IPS has improved their operating performance and their margins. But, we haven’t changed the underlying economics of the fact that maintenance of toll and road services doesn’t carry the same type of margin profile as our software businesses or as hardware photo applications. So, as we continue to do more on the tolling, maintenance and service side, we will have a – I won’t say mix because Brian will kick me, but we’ll have a variance associated with the relative growth rates of those businesses.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then on the industrial tech side, just given that much of the leverage came at the SG&A line to get the EBIT leverage that you delivered, is it fair to assume that Toronto was finally a significant contributor in the quarter?
John Humphrey: I mean Toronto was a nice contributor in each of the quarters.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird:  Okay. Was there any cost take-out visible on the SG&A line there? So, again in this space, you did comment about Europe weakness on the materials analysis side and some other things, but I am just again a little bit curious as to where the SG&A leverage came from? Is that take-out or is that?
John Humphrey: We just – the SG&A, it is drive revenue growth. And so when you are largely selling direct and you got the best technologies than anybody and you’ve got solid gross margins, you get the leverage on incremental revenue. So, we got some incremental revenue, we get the leverage.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Okay. Okay, thank you.
John Humphrey: Okay.
Operator:  We’ll go next to Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research Partners.
Jeff Sprague – Vertical Research Partners:  Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.
Brian Jellison: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeff Sprague – Vertical Research Partners: Hey, just a couple things. Brian, it sounded like the pipeline is fairly active despite biting off this nice big chunk here, should we expect more before the year end?
Brian Jellison: I don’t really know Jeff, it’s possible. I wish or wouldn’t rule against it. I know what we are willing to do. You never know what other people are willing to do. So, usually a bit outspread all the time when we are doing work. This transaction with Sunquest demonstrates kind of how we act right, so I mean, we started talking to these people in 2010 and we’ve – I’ll tell you sometimes we’ll get people ideas or whatever we wonder about what they are going to do, I think these people have done just a spectacular job of taking advantage of some momentum that we thought could be available to them. And they’ve done that. So, we have some transactions that are similar to this that we have been talking to people off and on about for several years. I think that depending on who owns the asset and what peoples think is going to happen between now and the end of the year around the tax structures going into next year. You have higher levels of seller activity if they believe nothing is going to change and they don’t have capital gains if they are worried about, they may hold on. On the other hand, they think that getting a high percentage of something is better than a lower percentage of something else. We may close the valuation gap, I don’t know. So, I think it’s possible that we would do another transaction, probably not quite as large as $1.4 billion, however.
Jeff Sprague – Vertical Research Partners: I would bet not, but that brings up another topic. What are you thinking about on the divestiture side, not naming names, of course, but clearly, the portfolio is changing this, maybe some pieces out of that are as not as core they used to be. It’s an interesting juncture right, I mean, your returns are so high anything you divest is dilutive, but at the time when you got maybe such accretive acquisition activity going on, perhaps there is an opportunity to move the portfolio a little bit differently. Are you thinking that way at all, is there any prospect for something leaving the portfolio in the next 6, 12 months?
Brian Jellison: Well, our core business is delivering a tremendous amount of cash. They have gotten dramatically better. Their cash returns are more than 50% better than they were like five years ago. They give us tremendous EPS performance, because they don’t have the non-GAAP amortization charges way against them. There is certainly an increasing inflection point, where you look at this and say what about this situation. We are in a marvelous place, where since we have maintained the autonomy of each one of these businesses. We can always decouple a business and not have any problem doing that. It’s not like some other strategic that’s got everything so embedded that one factory is making five items and one information system can’t go with the business. So, all our businesses are total, isolated and independent and anyone could be spun-off to another party. I think people largely have some ideas about which things might become available, kind of like the trade deadline right for Tuesday. So, depends who is willing to pay what, but we are not an active seller, but we have some assets that are probably more valuable to others than they are to us.
Jeff Sprague – Vertical Research Partners: And then just one final one for John, just on the EBITDA for Sunquest, does that $140 million include associated DA that comes with the acquisition accounting or is that the organic number?
John Humphrey: Well I mean since the EBITDA excludes the effect of amortization, I don’t think it really impacts that. Having said that the accretion number for the back half this year, the $0.12 to $0.14 that we expect, that does include the new amortization that we are estimating that we will absorb and then start to record post acquisition. So, on the EPS side, it definitely does include that of course always with the caveat it does not include the impact of the deferred revenue, fair value accounting treatment.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Could you just kind of clarify for us how much EBIT is in that $140 million EBITDA number next year?
John Humphrey: Well, here is – we have to finalize.
Brian Jellison: $35 million.
John Humphrey: Amortization, so I’d say if utilization comes in at $35 million to $40 million to $100 million of…
Brian Jellison: Roughly $35 million.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Thank you, gentlemen. Good luck.
John Humphrey: And I think we’ll – one more question.
Operator: We’ll go next to Alex Blanton, Clear Harbor Asset Management.
John Humphrey: Hello.
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: Yes. I think you’ll have to speaker him, okay. Can you hear me?
John Humphrey: Yes.
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: First I wanted to ask you about the Industrial Technology business and the Pump business specifically. Another company recently recorded a substantial decline in orders as Gardner Denver in the petroleum and industrial pump business and that particular business of theirs orders were down 36% in the quarter. And then in another division they had a pressure pumping order decline of 17%. And you haven’t seen anything like that, according to what you said, do you compete with them or are you taking market share or just what is going on here, because the two results are dramatically different?
Brian Jellison: Yeah, I think the markets we’re focused on are totally different for the most part than Gardner Denver, I mean we do have de-watering pumps that Cornell makes and those have certainly been used in the shale activity. Those have had strong growth, that growth is moderating, but it’s not totally negative at all. That’s pretty small part of the overall enterprise and our Roper Pump business continues to grow quite substantially. So, I think – gosh, I’m not really at all close to Gardner Denver but I’m – I think they’re building a lot of stuff that maybe is going into rental and platforms and that stuff. We have some rental business with Cornell, but it’s not the core component of what we do. So, we’re still making pumps for waste water activity, agriculture or irrigation and those kind of things.
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: Okay. Thank you. And second question is on the orders for RF technology, TransCore on July 19, said they were awarded Texas Department of Transportation Statewide Toll System integration and maintenance contract, replacing one of your competitors and you’ve get to replace all of their systems plus add your own to new systems that come on board. So, you didn’t mention this, I don’t believe. It seems to be a different project than the one you talked about in RF technology. Could you talk about this new TransCore business that was announced July 19?
John Humphrey: Sure Alex and you are correct it’s not the same one. The Hextra business of the Harris County is the one that we talked about. What you’re referring to is the TxDOT, which operates a different set of toll lanes across the State of Texas. Anyway, I’ll be providing them with software and maintenance activity. More of a – it’s an indefinite quantity, indefinite timing, so it’s in IDIQ type of contract. And so it doesn’t have the same immediate booking that the more definite execution for the Harris County does. So we expect the Texas contract to – sorry the TxDOT contract to add maybe $30 million over the next three years, but at a timing that may be a little bit lumpy as they decide on when to update and when to update their specific lanes.
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: Okay.
Brian Jellison: It just validates the strength of our technology. I think people just – I’m not sure by understand the strength of our technology compared to others and increasingly they are going to learn that
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: Okay. Thank you very much and congratulations on the Sunquest.
Brian Jellison: Thank you very much, Alex.
John Humphrey: Thanks, Alex.
Operator: That ends our question-and-answer session for this call. We would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. John Humphrey for any additional or closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Thank you and thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you after we complete our third quarter.
Operator: That concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: Thanks, John. Today we’ll kind of go through the first quarter enterprise financial results and then we’ll get into the specific segment detail and the outlook for each of the four segments for the second quarter and balance of the year. We’ll update you on our established guidance for the second quarter and our full-year guidance, and then take your questions. So next slide, please? The first quarter here was another spectacular quarter. We achieved all-time records for revenue, orders, net earnings, EBITDA, operating and free cash flow in the quarter. Total sales were up 10% and importantly organic revenue was up 8%. Our book-to-bill ratio was above 1 at a strong 1.03. Gross margins reached 55%, which is really quite remarkable, and our operating margin leverage was spectacular in the quarter. Operating margins were up 200 basis points to 24%, and our incremental operating margins were 43% in the first quarter. We closed out the quarter with 205 million in EBITDA and an EBITDA margin of 28.9%. The diluted earnings per share were up 20% to $1.09. More importantly, the free cash flow was up 69% to 131 million in the quarter. It is an all-time record first quarter for us and a great start for 2012. Next slide? Our first quarter income statement, you can see here that the revenue was up 10%, 8 organic, and book-to-bill at 1.03. Gross profit up another 70 basis points to 55%. Operating income was up 20%. Tax rate was a little bit higher than the first quarter of a year ago – 40 basis points higher, which cost us a penny. Still, net earnings were up 22% and you can see the DEPS line at 1.09. Next slide? We had terrific EBITDA growth in the quarter, and if you just continue to look at our trend you can see on this chart our trailing 12-months EBITDA now is $830 million, up from 685 last year on a trailing 12-month basis and 519 million on a trailing basis at the end of Q1 2010. So we’ve added 60% to our EBITDA in just the last two years, and our EBITDA margins on a trailing basis are up 400 basis points from 25% in 2010 to 29% in 2012. People from time to time, investors ask, when are you going to have that deterioration in margin? Our plan would be never. We’re just going to continue to move up that line because of the culture and focus we have here. Next slide? Q1 cash flow, you can see another blowout kind of a quarter here. Our cash conversion was very strong. We had 141 million in operating cash flow, which was $0.20 of every dollar of revenue. The conversion on that, 131% of net earnings. We invested about 10 million in capital in the quarter, which was 1.4% of revenue, right within our kind of 1.2 to 1.6% of revenue plans. So free cash flow was 131 million, 18% of revenue, and the conversion at 121. A remarkable performance against last year’s first quarter, where we had 78 million of free cash flow last year in the first quarter and 131 million this year in the quarter. Next slide? Our asset velocity continues to improve. I know people keep saying it can’t be done, it won’t get better; but it does get better. If you look at the same period, inventory is now down to 7.5%, receivables actually dropped down to 14.5%, payables and accruals at 14.9, so our inventory plus receivables less payables and accruals closed out at 7.1%. If you look at the trend in 2009, it was 9.6, finally breaking below 10, and people would ask us if you could get any better, and the answer is oh yeah – you can get better. Two hundred and fifty basis points improvement over that three-year period, closing out at 7.1% - very exceptional performance. Next slide? Balance sheet is pretty strong here. Cash – if we look at a year ago, we had 261 million in cash and we closed out this quarter with 452 million of cash. We had drawn a little bit against our revolver, which had 750 million of capacity this time a year ago. Now, our undrawn revolver is just that – we don’t have anything drawn against it, so you take that cash and the undrawn revolver and you get a little over 1.2 billion. Our trailing 12-months EBITDA is now up to 830 million, quite a substantial increase over the trailing EBITDA at this point in 2011, so it of course has a very dramatic positive effect on all of our credit stats. Our gross debt is less than it was a year ago, and our shareholder equity has increased by $450 million in the year from 2.882 billion to 3.332 billion, which then brings down the gross debt to cap number from 30% to 24.4, and gives us a gross debt to EBITDA line at 1.3. You can kind of do the math on the net debt to EBITDA line and you’ll come up with quite a remarkable number. Segment details here on the next slide – really, all of the segments had extraordinary performance. They all had double digit growth in operating profit. Next slide – we’ll start with the RF segment. Revenue was up 2% but operating profit was up 12%. Operating margin was 24.6% for RF, up 220 basis points, and they finished the quarter with a gross margin of 52%. They had very strong leverage in higher margin areas, obviously, when revenue is up 2 but OP is up 12%. We certainly had a headwind on that revenue line because the Gaz de France project, which was in 2011, was substantial in Q1 and quite substantial in Q2, was completed last year so we don’t have anything other than administrative revenue associated with that now, which makes comps for RF a little bit difficult the first couple quarters of this year. We continued to have expansion in both the security and cashless payment systems that we have for higher education. That drove substantial growth in the software platform, and then our SAS-based solution networks have added subscribers both in our freight systems area and in our food service areas, and our European expansion continued. Our toll and traffic service business was led by electronic tolling conversion we’re doing in Puerto Rico that adds to our growth and offsets the sort of weakness in other areas around transportation. For the rest of 2012, we have fighting us, particularly in Q2, the Gaz de France project which is completed. That takes some revenue away, makes for a difficult comp. Our pole project activity in last year’s second quarter was a record in the last three years and quite disproportionate to the rest of the year, so that’s a difficult comp. That said, we’ll still perform better because of the strength of the rest of the businesses in the RF segment. We expect to have continued growth in software and SAS network businesses, particularly in the campus area and the growth of subscribers in our networks. Next slide? Industrial technology – here you can see revenue was up double digits at 15%. Operating profit was up 25%, and our OP margins really are spectacular at 29.5% OP. Compare that to most people’s gross margins – it’s really quite a remarkable achievement – 29.5% OP, up 230 basis points. Our gross margins in this segment were 51%.  In the quarter, fluid handling was very strong once again as we continue to gain share in the oil and gas industry with the shale activity that’s going on. We have a variety of new products that are going into our agricultural applications around irrigation, and those are doing very well; and then we’ve had some pumping activity we do in the transport and industrial arena which was quite strong in the quarter as well. The Toronto water meter project is kind of moving ahead as planned, which gave us some growth in the first quarter, and then the U.S. municipal market in Q1 was relatively strong for Neptune. We had significant increase in our material analysis equipment and consumables business in Denmark as industrial production around the world continues to expand. That business continues to have double digit growth. And the margins in the quarter, as I said, really were remarkable. It’s an all-time record OP margin for us, which is coming from capturing the leverage off of the growth. For the remainder of the year in 2012, the segment backlog is quite strong and that supports continued growth, even if orders were to moderate. The industrial and shale end market remain quite favorable to us, and these outstanding margins that we captured in the first quarter, we believe that the things we’ve done to get better margins are sustainable and will continue throughout 2012 at these higher levels. Next slide? The medical and scientific imaging segment, here you’ve got revenue growth, again double digit at 12%, OP growth at 24%, operating margin up 250 basis points to 26.6%. We were benefited by having Northern Digital in the first quarter, which delivered exactly what we expected out of them on the revenue side and even better margins. We’ve had a very, very strong first quarter with Gatan in the electron microscopy arena. Those end markets are pretty good and we’ve recently introduced some products there in the last 15 months which are continuing to grow and add to Gatan’s strength. Our medical expansion internationally continued in the quarter, gave us some growth as well. And then this margin performance that we’ve gotten from the operating leverage here in medical really was terrific, and it offset what otherwise would have been a tough first quarter because North American research funding has been quite soft and the life science area around our photonics camera businesses was weak. For the second quarter, we’ll have some continuing weakness around those North American research markets. We don’t see that picking up, but it may get better than it was in the first quarter.  We expect to continue to grow the medical business. We’re experiencing an increase in consumables as we think we’re gaining share, and the end markets are favorable in each of the product categories that we participate. Northern Digital in the second half of the year will become organic for us, and that will help our organic growth profile. And Gatan’s backlog, which is quite heavy and we’d like to see shipments improve in Q2, but they certainly are going to improve strongly in the second half of the year. It gives us confidence for the full year as a whole. Gross margins, I guess I could say, were a modest 65% in medical and imaging in the quarter.  Next slide? Energy systems and controls up – whoops! Same old story, isn’t it? Revenue up 15%, operating profit up 23%, OP margins 24%. You know, energy systems Q1 OP margins are usually the worst of the year, but these are pretty good at 24%, but will improve, I’ve been assured. In the first quarter, our compressor controls business continued to grow nicely with projects in both LNG and upstream activities. The oil and gas markets continue to be very favorable to us in our diesel engine safety shutoff systems and in the valves that we provide, both to oil and gas and marine. Very good instrument sales for the petrochem and refining markets, and we acquired a small but important company called Cambridge Viscosity, which gets us online Internet capacity around measuring data. I’ll ask John to talk a little bit about this small acquisition.
John Humphrey: Sure. We recently completed the Cambridge acquisition, just within the last month of the quarter so it didn’t contribute an awful lot. You can see it on the cash flow statement, kind of the range that we paid there. But what this really provides is viscosity measurement for fluids, both in the oil area but also in the petrochemical, so it adds additional technology to our existing set of businesses there. And so Cambridge will be able to kind of come into an existing sales channel, but also provides additional online work, so outside of the laboratory into the process. So it’s a nice fit both for us as well as for Cambridge and additional technology, and they’ll be able to benefit from our expanded reach and we’ll be able to benefit from their technology. So I think that’s going to be a nice acquisition for us that will start to contribute in the second quarter and beyond.
Brian Jellison: Okay, thank you. We’re going to have for the rest of the year double-digit growth, we believe, in energy. We’ve got record backlog at the moment. We have continuing strength in incoming orders and we’ve got favorable industrial end markets for our one business that kind of fits to the industrial area, our Dynisco business. We expect that that should continue to be okay throughout the year. We’ve got great operating leverage in the remainder of the year, and the execution and focus of everybody in this business is quite strong. Next slide? This will be our introduction into our 2012 guidance. I’ll talk a little bit about the quarter and then the full year, and of course we’ve raised our guidance. Next slide? For the full year, we’ve raised the guidance to 4.75, which is an $0.08 increase on the bottom end and to 4.91, which is an increase on the high end as well. And in the second quarter, we’ll have some headwinds and a little bit of confusing data. Last year we reported, as you can see on this slide, a $1.03 excluding a $0.05 re-measurement gain for foreign currency that we had, and that’s the way we treated that throughout the year on a GAAP basis. In some reporting services, you’ll see $1.08 which includes the $0.05 re-measurement gain, but our baseline is $1.03. The second quarter last year was extraordinary compared to the rest of the year, and so it was $1.03 and the second quarter in 2010 was $0.74. So our guidance for the second quarter of this year is $1.11 to $1.15. At the midpoint of that, it’s still double-digit growth over last year. We do have some comparative headwinds around the Gaz de France contract, which was large last year, that we had this North American research softness and we have some toll shipment timing things that occurred last year. It was the best quarter for the TransCore business in three years in the second quarter last year. On a full-year basis, of course, a modest growth trend, and that we expect will continue this year but we won’t have the outsized second quarter. That said, we still look for quite strong results in the second quarter and much stronger results for the second half and the full year. We’ve raised our operating cash flow projection. We had said it could be 650 million. We’re now saying it ought to be between that and 675 million for the full year. Next slide? So if we recap here before we go to Q&A, the first quarter produced all-time records for revenue orders, net earnings, EBITDA, operating and free cash flow, spectacular gross margin at 55%, very strong cash conversion around the operating cash flow and the free cash flow, with free cash flow being up 69%. Our book-to-bill strongly above 1 at 1.03, terrific operating leverage which just speaks to the quality of our different operating teams around the world, and we’ve raised the guidance as we go into the balance of the year. We certainly expect to have record performance for 2012 as a whole, and I think with that, John, we can open it up to questions.
John Humphrey: Okay. All right, Jake, we’re ready for the Q&A session.
Operator: Very well. If you would like to ask a question, you may do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your touchtone telephone. We ask that our callers limit their questions to one main question and one follow-up question. We will pause for just a moment. And our first question will come from Dean Dray, Citi Investment Research.
Dean Dray – Citi Investment Research: Thank you. Good morning everyone. The comments on shale activity – so, we’ve seen a big ramp-up in all the fracking opportunities, and you’ve participated both in the industrial side on the pumps and on the compressor controllers, but you’re seeing some investment move away from that given low nat gas prices. Is that embedded in your guidance, and maybe you can just give us some real-time color as to what you’re seeing in that segment.
John Humphrey: Sure. Now of course, in our real time color, we’re not really on the leading edge of exploration activity. We’re more along in how they go about on the production side once they’ve ramped up there. So real time information, I think you may be able to get better color on that from someone else. Now our activity there is both on the natural gas side as well as on the oil side, so what we have been seeing at least over the last quarter or so is some of those rigs start to move and really ramp up more on the oil side and less on the gas side as you were talking about. We still see very solid activity. Of course, as we have more pumps that are deployed, we’ll see more after-market revenue associated with that as well. And then the LNG and the other investments, in order to make sure that the transport and processing of the gas particularly, as well as on the oil side but mostly on the gas side, those investments are continuing and those are in our backlog in one of our businesses in particular. So embedded in our expectation for the rest of the year, I wouldn’t say is a ramp-up of activity; it’s kind of steady state about what we’re seeing today, and that’s our expectation based upon the backlog and the quote activity out of our businesses.
Dean Dray – Citi Investment Research: Great. And then the follow-up question over on the RF side, there’s been some speculation that TransCore’s number one U.S. competitor could be for sale. They’re in a number of interesting markets and customer relationships and so forth. Would you be boxed out from an anti-trust reason to be able to—if that asset were available, or the other side, might it be competitively at a disadvantage if it fell into a stronger competitor?
Brian Jellison: Are you suggesting that they’re a weak competitor? It would be safe to say that there are two large players in this space around hardware applications – one of those is a European company, the other is ourselves. There are a number of players in the back office administrative space, and the company you’re talking about, which is a publicly-traded company, has a very, very modest position in back office activity as part of that. So we wouldn’t view that as being anti-competitive in any way.
Dean Dray – Citi Investment Research :  I’m not quite sure I understood the answer. Would there be a reason that it would make sense to be paired with TransCore?
John Humphrey: Well, as the strongest player in toll and traffic world, I think it’s always a beneficial thing for someone to want to join with TransCore. But in our future, we feel very comfortable with the set of technologies and services that we’re providing to that marketplace. We’re happy with our position, but if something else happens there, then we’ll see what that looks like.
Dean Dray – Citi Investment Research: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And now we will take a question from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Good morning gentlemen. Brian, you were talking about industrial tech and the very strong margin improvement there. Correct me if I’m wrong, but 1Q is typically the weakest from a volume and margin standpoint, and it looks like it’s been the highest ever. So did mix play into that to some degree? Can you flesh that out, what drove the margins, and then can you even take it to 30 exiting 2012?
Brian Jellison: Well, it’d be a great goal. When we think about weak Q1, we really only think about the energy systems business. I wouldn’t think normally about industrial necessarily being weak. There is some times based on weather that Neptune might not be very good because you’ve got winter and so forth, but that wasn’t the case this year. But I don’t—seasonal Q4 for them is difficult just because of the time of the year it is. I think as long as we get revenue growth, we’re going to continue to have favorable leverage – it’s as simple as that. We expect to have continued revenue growth, so we would expect to maintain or enhance our leverage.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Okay, but it wasn’t a really strong mix component in there this quarter that—
Brian Jellison: No, no there wasn’t. There wasn’t any unusual activity. I will say—I mean, certainly the pump businesses, as they grow, throw off a lot of cash and very favorable incremental returns, so that’s something that has grown a lot more in the last year or two than historically it’s grown. So that supports better results in the quarter.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Okay, helpful. And then can you break down your second half versus one half expectations, and maybe what you’re thinking organic growth consolidated for 2012, at least a bounded range?
Brian Jellison: Yeah, I think we could take a swipe at that. Second half organic growth should be better in our view. Our guidance at the beginning of the year was 5 to 8, and we had 8 in the first quarter. We would expect less than that in the second quarter, and that or more in the third and fourth quarters. So we’d still stay generally with this kind of up to 8% organic growth for the full year, and at the low end of that range in Q2 and at the high end of that range in Q3 and Q4.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Thank you.
Operator: And now we’ll move to a question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
Jeff Sprague – Vertical Research Partners: Thank you. Good morning, gents. Just a couple questions – Brian, thinking about the strength in the secular growth that has materialized in these energy and pump-related businesses, they maybe haven’t been a huge source of M&A although you did a deal in that space this quarter. But has your view about the long-term attractiveness of those businesses changed for the better? Might you be more active there over time?
Brian Jellison: Yeah, I wouldn’t rule it out, Jeff; but the reality is when we look at most of the businesses in that space are trading at relatively high valuations versus their intrinsic long-term value, and they have a lot of assets and we’re still pretty wedded to the concept of being asset-light. So I think we would prefer to buy intellectual property that we could deploy into those businesses using their existing assets. I think to find something that we could buy—we have looked at a couple of things, but in terms of how we think they should be valued on a cash flow basis, I think some people are overpaying for those flow control assets at the moment. As you know, we rarely would, I don’t believe ever, overpay for anything.
Jeff Sprague – Vertical Research Partners: And maybe on that, the bias not to overpay seems to keep the M&A activity at a relatively low level. What’s going on out there in terms of valuations and pipeline and attractiveness of assets?
Brian Jellison: You know, I think there is so much going on that it’s a classic case of you don’t want to do something that’s good when the best thing is around the corner. So in a good-better-best situation with the strength of our balance sheet we have, we’re looking for the best thing. We think we have a couple of best things identified and we’re doing a lot of work, and we’re very excited about what will happen over the next months.
Jeff Sprague – Vertical Research Partners: So we shouldn’t rule out something meaningful in 2012, it sounds like.
Brian Jellison: I wouldn’t rule it out.
Jeff Sprague – Vertical Research Partners: And then just one final one and then I’ll pass it on – Gatan, is there an issue there with them not being able to deliver relative to backlog, a production issue or something? What’s going on there? You kind of called it out—
Brian Jellison: A production issue. They always have very sophisticated sensor technology we have to buy, and it’s oftentimes only produced periodically. The orders have been pretty good, and they do have some occasional bottlenecks in Gatan, and they’re forecasting kind of treading water in Q2. We’d suggest it would be better if they swam, so I think they understand our view of that. But that’s kind of where that is. We don’t see anything but upside in Gatan for the full year, but they had a really remarkable first quarter and so they didn’t pace themselves at all. I think they have to kind of gear up here again for Q2 and maybe they’re being a little conservative, for those of you in Pleasanton who are listening.
Jeff Sprague – Vertical Research Partners: Great. Thanks, Brian.
Operator: And next we’ll hear from Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: Thanks. Good morning. I want to find out what the assumptions are behind your guidance. You’ve raised your guidance. I’m not sure I heard the exact reason for that. But what are you assuming about the economy, about Europe, about Asia and whatnot in the guidance, because my thinking is if you’re doing this well in a weak recovery, what are you going to do when the recovery accelerates?
Brian Jellison: Well, we’ll do better. 
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: Right, but what if it happens? What’s behind your guidance right now? You’re assuming continued weakness in the economy?
Brian Jellison: Certainly what we would see—we’ve had strength everywhere except for Europe, and Europe was positive but it was only up a couple of percent versus everything else being up double digits and Canada and Asia being up over 20%. We do just see some areas that are going to be weak. This North American research funding scenario puts a real brake on our photonics businesses in a negative way, so that kind of pares back revenue some from what we’d like to have. On the other hand, margins in those businesses are not as high, and their cash generation capability is a little less good so they don’t hurt us overall. For the year, we expect to do sort of okay. We’re going with a 30% tax rate for the year as a whole. I think if we wind up with 8% organic growth on the year, I think if it’s not best in class, I’d be surprised. So we think that’s pretty good. Now if things picked up and became better, then obviously as the year went on we’d look at higher numbers.
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: Okay, so you’ve got a conservative forecast here.
John Humphrey: Yeah, and the other thing—
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: You’re not looking for much improvement in the economy.
John Humphrey:  And Alex, the other thing I would say about that is remember, we’re a collection of many different niche markets, and the things that may be a little bit weaker that you may be referring to around housing or something like that, we don’t really have any exposure to speak of to new construction activity or automobile production, or some of those areas that are more broadly aligned with kind of the more cyclical aspects of GDP. So as we look at our individual niche markets, we see a number of them that I wouldn’t characterize as weak today and that we expect them to continue to perform well.
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Matt Summerville with Keybanc will have the next question.
Matt Summerville – Keybanc:  Morning. A couple questions on the medical and life sciences area – Brian, can you talk about where you’re at with some of the new products, or the new product pipeline with Verathon? A couple of the other divisions I think that you’d talked about in the last quarter as having maybe—or last quarter two as maybe having some pretty meaningful launches slated for this year.
Brian Jellison: Well, in Verathon we have a product called Heartscape which is an important product for us, and it’s launched in Europe. It’s not launched in the U.S.; we still are going through regulatory issues with that to get it launched. I think whenever it launches, it should be a very good product. We don’t have it in for much of our guidance for the balance of this year. It’s more likely to be something that could help in 2013 from the U.S. perspective, but sales have started in Europe, and in fact our leader of Verathon is on a plane as we speak right now, going over to have some meetings over there with people on the subject. So I think that’s pretty good. We have some CIVCO and MEDtech products that are launching in the second half, and some things that they’ve been working on that we kind of know are going to beneficial in second half of the year. And then Northern Digital, we’re doing several things in Northern Digital to broaden their range of activity, which we expect to pay dividends in the second half.
Matt Summerville – Keybanc: And then as a follow-up, you mentioned in terms of the headwinds you’re encountering in the second quarter – the Gaz de France, the toll shipments being maybe unusually high last year. Are you able to ballpark or quantify, if you will, the hole in revenue that you guys are kind of comping against? Is that a $5 million headwind, a $15 million headwind? Can you frame that up a little bit for us?
Brian Jellison: I’d say 10 million or more.
John Humphrey: Yeah, I’d say a little north of 10.
Matt Summerville – Keybanc: And then are you able to quantify as well in imaging what the impact is with regards to the downward pressure in NIH and other public funding sources? Or maybe, how much of your business there do you feel is driven by public funding?
Brian Jellison: Well we want to just kind of clarify in terms of that. When we say we’re down, I’d say it’s a little over 10 million for just the tolling and the Gaz de France, which both happened to be in the RF segment, and it could be even a little higher than that on a comparable business.
John Humphrey: Right.
Brian Jellison: But imaging is a different thing and of course in a different segment. The problem with imaging is that Gatan will probably outperform enough to make up for that camera softness, but the camera softness from the funding, both in Japan and the U.S., probably a double-digit negative on their baseline. So that’s likely to be a drag in each of the second and third quarters, and that would be in the mid-millions.
Matt Summerville – Keybanc: Thanks a lot, Brian. Appreciate it.
Operator: Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs will have the next question.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Brian, I wonder if you could help us a little bit with the Aussie LNG outlook for compressor controls. How big is that business for compressor controls today, and what kind of growth do you see over the next three or five years, given the CAPEX trajectory that everyone is looking at there?
Brian Jellison: John’s opening up his book.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Is he smiling while he’s doing that? 
Brian Jellison: Yeah, he’s smiling. I think he’s smiling. That’s a little granular there.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Well, I just—the reason I ask, obviously it’s not a huge business for you, but it’s one of the bigger ones ex-the top couple. But the CAPEX numbers there are huge, and if you’re thinking longer term on growth for that segment, you’ve talked about double-digit for this year so there’s a confidence and a visibility there. I’m just wondering if we can think about continuing to see double-digit growth for ’13, ’14, given what you’re seeing on the shale gas infrastructure build-out but also the Aussie LNG piece. 
Brian Jellison: Absolutely we would expect double-digit growth – no question about that. I mean, we’ve built a great organization there. We’ve put as much talent in there as any place in the company, and it’s got a very much broader leadership team and capability team. We have terrific people throughout that organization, and we’ve made some acquisitions there. You know, we acquired Trinity, we acquired United Controls in addition to the investments in the structure we’ve put in. I mean, they are absolutely going to do double-digit growth, and we’ve completely refurbished the headquarters operation at Des Moines, which for those people who have ever been there, it’s unbelievable. It really does look like a technology business now, and double-digit growth will be easy for them to obtain.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: I don’t know if John wants to tell us what’s in his book there, but does it get big enough, and is that growth rate big enough to really give you some confidence that energy systems in total can be double-digit ’13 and beyond?
John Humphrey:  ’13 and beyond, I mean, I wouldn’t say that we have a view on ’13 and beyond yet. I think most of our commentary is really about ’12, and it’s true the backlog and the growth that we have seen out of energy so far in this region has clearly been above the average for the segment in total. Brian talked a little bit about the fact that we were up 22%--20% north in Asia and as well as in Canada, but also in the rest of world category which includes Australia as well as a few others – that’s also north of 20% for us. And we’ve seen at least four energy systems and controls just north of 20%, and that’s largely driven by the investments that are happening. And now, it’s still off of a relatively small base, so I don’t want to overplay this, but it does add to our backlog and add to the LNG position that we have, where I think that we’re largely seen as the best control systems provider for any type of LNG plant anywhere around the world. So the fact that they are making strong investments there at the Gorgon site as well as at others is going to continue to benefit us, we think.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then maybe just a little bit more color on the slower growth in Europe – I think you said up a couple percent. Just trying to recall your profile there – I guess I thought you were overweight Europe relative to company average in energy and medical, so I might take the comments on funding to mean that medical was a drag and maybe even negative in Europe. One would assume energy is still running strong there. But if you just profile Europe exposures for us more broadly and just identify which businesses are really driving that slowdown.
Brian Jellison: Well, we actually grew in Europe; just we didn’t grow at the same rate as other places. So it’s not a matter of not growing, it’s just in Europe we grew at 2%, and in the quarter every other geography was double-digit growth. So we had 10% growth in the U.S. and 22% in Canada and Asia, and 13% in the rest of the world. It was just Europe up 2. So the growth remains fine, and Europe represents less than 20% of Roper – it’s in the sort of 15 to 18 category, so it’s not a major drag. Energy was up double digits but medical was very close to that. It was really the change in Europe was purely from the Gaz de France contract that we had. It was unique and was just something that occurred, and it was down sharply. If you hadn’t had that adjustment, you would have had close to double-digit growth everywhere. So that was—you know, it took some points off of our growth profile.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Okay, that’s helpful. And then lastly, Brian, the industrial markets within your pump business, are you seeing any signs of slowdown there or do you think the growth rates can continue where you’ve identified them here, which I think was up single digits?
Brian Jellison: Yeah, they were probably a little better than that. We certainly aren’t seen any fall-off in those at all.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator: And now we’ll move to the next question, and that will come from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Thanks, good morning. If you mentioned imaging organic growth, I didn’t catch it; but could you elaborate on that and if that outlook is a little better for the entire segment than you had earlier?
Brian Jellison: I don’t know; I thought we were pretty clear when we went through that.
John Humphrey: Yeah, medical and imaging were up 4% organically in the quarter.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Okay. And then a broad one on industrial tech and energy – it’s been alluded to, but you’re establishing some pretty tough comps and a nice track record there, cyclical going your way and everything. So thinking about the longer term comps and what you can do from here, I’m wondering as you look at new products, OEM and channel expansion work that you do, are those opportunities that remain fundamentally part of the long-term outlook for industrial tech and energy systems to continue to kind of recreate your organic growth profile there?
Brian Jellison: Our industrial businesses really are not OEM for the most part. Our industrial businesses are our product solutions for direct customers. In the energy arena, we do some OEM activity, but even there it’s not super high. But our engine shutoff valves, for instance, somebody could argue that’s an OEM product going into most everybody’s diesel engine. Fortunately we don’t look at it that way; we look at it as a solution that the customer really requires and the engine manufacturer has to buy.
John Humphrey: And I do think, Chris, that you’re right – we’ve definitely benefited from the investments that we have made and continue to make in new product development and channel development for those. I mean, you’ve seen that out of our fluid handling businesses with expansion of channel activity, particularly in wastewater and agriculture areas, rental market expansion, new product applications in oil and gas for our fluid handling, as well as in our energy systems businesses. And we continue to focus on those areas where customers are really going to benefit from the technologies that we can provide and the application knowledge that we have. I don’t see that as being something that—our businesses will continue to reinvent themselves, but I don’t really think of it as reinventing. It’s just a question of expanding their solution set and becoming even more important to how customers are able to be successful. That’s what they’ve done this year, and I expect them to do that next year, just as they’ve done over the previous decades.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Thanks. It’s very helpful. 
Operator:  And now we’ll move to Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird:  Yes, good morning. Brian, in the RF technology segment in general as we move through calendar ’12, is the—should the expectation be that there’s more, you know, service and admin revenue, less hardware, hence this margin profile can actually work from here higher, even though our sales mix and maybe sales level won’t be as great in terms of growth?
Brian Jellison: I think if I understood you right – let me sort of test that – that the service revenue is lower than the hardware revenue in terms of margins, so if hardware is diminished at the expense of services, it would hurt the margins. What you’re seeing and the reason the margins continue to grow is that our software businesses, which are in RF, are expanding and they carry much higher margins, both at the gross and operating level and the cash flow levels. So those are going to continue to push out the mix of the tolling and service processing portions of RF at a fairly rapid pace.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Okay, so the CBORD, the freight matching, ITrade – those businesses are up nicely versus—you know, that’s where the mix is coming from rather than a hardware service mix.
Brian Jellison: Right.
John Humphrey: Yeah, particularly on the margin side, that’s for sure.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Okay, understood. And then within industrial tech, the Neptune business, we’re kind of feeling in the marketplace there that seasonality and weather played a more substantial role this quarter. Are you comfortable that the municipal market is in fact starting to recover, or is this almost an anomaly based on weather and the seasonal pattern that we would typically see in the water metering market?
Brian Jellison: I don’t know. We’ve read some comments from others, and we wonder. I think that the weather had to help Q1 for people. We certainly don’t see a robust municipal market for anybody, and we don’t see speedy decisions occurring in municipal markets. We have a huge installed base, and so that continues unabated; but there’s no question if municipal houses were in a little better shape, or you had any new residential construction, we’d have a growth spurt.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Okay. And John, just quick question on Toronto – is it still reasonable to assume that we can do about 40 million or bill out 40 million on Toronto this year?
John Humphrey: Yeah, that’s our prediction.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Yes? Okay. Great, thank you much. Great quarter.
Operator: And that will end our question and answer session for this call. We will now return back to John Humphrey for closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Okay, thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again in July as we complete our second quarter.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

Operator:  The Roper Industries Fourth Quarter 2011 Financial Results call will now begin. As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Alan, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of the fourth quarter and full-year 2011. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today’s call. We have prepared slides to accompany today’s call which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com. If you could please turn to Slide 2, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today’s call, we will be making forward-looking statements were are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today’s call in the context of that information. Now if you’ll please turn to Slide 3, I’ll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: Thanks, John. Good morning everybody. So we’ll walk you through briefly how the fourth quarter looked, what our full-year enterprise results for 2011 were, and what some of those implications are for positioning ourselves in 2012. We’ll go through the segment detail in terms of how we see 2012 by segment, talk about our guidance for the coming year, and then open it up for Q&A. So next slide here would be an overview of the fourth quarter. It was an all-time record quarter for us for any quarter in the history of the Company, and we had the most revenue, most net earnings, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, operating and free cash flow. Total sales were up 9%, organic sales were up 7 – frankly, better organic sales growth than we would have expected back six or seven months ago, so things still look pretty favorable in that arena. Gross margins were up to 54.9%, demonstrating that we’re certainly not under a lot of price pressure in the marketplace and that everything we’re doing continues to work exceptionally well. EBITDA was 222 million in the quarter, which is beyond a spectacular number in our opinion. EBITDA margins were 30.1% and certainly a milestone for Roper and speaks to the quality of the businesses that we have.  Our earnings in the quarter were $1.23 - we talk about that in the income statement here - up from $1.10. Last year fourth quarter, operating cash flow was another sort of spectacular $193 million in the quarter. That represented 158% of net earnings on a conversion basis and represented 26% of sales. Free cash flow was 181 million. Same story – 149% of net earnings here for conversion, so it was quite a strong finish in the fourth quarter to what was an historic year for us. Next slide – here if we look at the fourth quarter income statement, you’ll see bookings were basically flat. There are a couple reasons for that. The fourth quarter last year, our orders were up 23% over the prior year, so it was an exceptionally unusual and difficult comp, and we had three things happen that we detailed last year. We had quite a substantial Mexican order for Neptune - that tends to be a non-recurring type of item when those happen; some unique shipments in the camera arena around some specific CAPEX that was going on in China; and then we had a Gaz de France project largely booked and that was completed in the fourth quarter this year. So those were unusual headwinds that exceeded $30 million. The backlog is up though, as you can see, by 5.5%, so backlog was at $828 million which is an all-time record for a year-ending backlog number for us. Net sales were up 9%, 7% organic. Gross profit, as we covered, was up 20 BPs. Operating income at 187 million was up 13%, and operating margin was above 25%, up 80 BPs in the quarter. You can see the tax rate was actually a little bit of a negative headwind in the quarter compared to last year. We had a particularly favorable tax rate in Q4 last year – 27.7 for us, and the fourth quarter this year was 29%, so that cost us $0.02 a share. Nonetheless, we still are in at $1.23 on DEPS. Next slide – if you look at fourth quarter cash flow, it’s for us kind of just a breathtaking accomplishment – 193 million of operating cash flow in the quarter, and that’s up dramatically. Last year, our record year was 155 million, and if you look at fourth quarter 2009 it was 120 million; so we just continue to pile up the cash. If you look at the variances, it’s up 24% as you can see on this slide from the fourth quarter a year ago, and 61% from 2009. Next slide – here we’ll start to look at the full-year enterprise results. Next slide – we again achieved a record result on an annual basis as well as a quarter. On an annual basis, it just again includes everything and the kitchen sink here – historic levels of orders, backlog, sales, net earnings, EBITDA, operating and free cash flow. Sales for the year were up 17%, organic growth for 2011 was 13%. Remember, when we established guidance at the beginning of the year, we thought organic growth might be 9 to 11, so it came in substantially stronger than we had expected. Gross margin was up 80 BPs to 54.2%, operating margin up 200 BPs to 23.6, which is really an incredible achievement for all of our 28 P&Ls around the world that are so terrifically focused on margin and cash and growth. Our EBITDA for the year was up 164 million to 802 million. By the way, we had a re-measurement gain in the second quarter and we’re excluding that from this 802 million number; otherwise, it would have been 809, but that’s a non-recurring item. The EBITDA margin expanded to 28.7% for the full year and operating cash flow for the full year was 602 million or 22% of revenue. Free cash flow at 561 million was 20% of sales, so another terrific year for the Roper family of businesses. Next slide – here if we look at the full-year income statement, you’ll see bookings were up 11% on the year. Net sales up 17, organic 13. Gross margin up 80 BPs, operating margin up 200, as we said. Tax rate on the year came in at 29.4, which was 130 BPs headwind compared to the prior year, so that cost us $0.08 a share. Despite that, we reported DEPS of 4.34, and the one thing we’d point out there again is that re-measurement gain is in the GAAP number at 4.34. Next slide – here if we look at our EBITDA growth, you can see the trends and performance in terms of capturing our gross margins in the form of EBITDA for our investors. We had EBITDA of 802, as we mentioned, which is up 300 million from two years ago. Our EBITDA margins two years ago were 24.5%, and common questions to us always are how are you ever going to keep those margins? They’ve got to degrade. Nobody can have margins like this. They’re going to regress to some artificial mean that S&P 500 companies are stuck with; but that’s not the case here. As you can see, our margins were up from 24.5% to 26.7% last year and just continued forward at 28.7% this year. That’s a 420 basis point improvement in just two years in our EBITDA margins. Next slide – our full-year cash flow, again, tells the story of Roper’s business model: 602 million in operating cash flow representing 22% of revenue, free cash flow 20% of revenue, terrific execution throughout the enterprise. Net working capital, still—and our definition of inventory and receivables less payables and accruals is, like, 6% of less; so just spectacular performance from the field here. And you can see that trend up from 367 million of operating cash flow in ’09 to 500 to 602, and we’re forecasting continued growth in 2012. Next slide – we have a really terrific balance sheet. We close out the year in a very strong position. You can see cash was up 68 million to 338 million. Our undrawn revolver is totally undrawn at 750 million; last year we had 520. We get the benefit of trailing EBITDA coming up at 802; last year it was 638, so when you think about all those kind of investment-grade characteristics and multiply it times EBITDA, and you look at the powder we have, we’ve got really a spectacular balance sheet. Gross debt to capitalization is 25.4, and when you look at the net debt number, we have about 1.85 billion in gross debt. With the 338 in cash, you’d have net debt of 747 million against 802 million of trailing EBITDA, so it goes without saying that 2012 is likely going to be a strongly above-average acquisition year for Roper, and we’re very excited about our prospects in that arena. Next slide – here we’ll get into the individual segments. All of them are just faithfully executing the business models that they drive, and you can see there is just no softness anywhere inside the full-year activity. RF technologies, sales were up 17%, operating profit up 35, and margins up 300 BPs. Industrial technology was up 21%, OP up 29%, and margins up 150. And boy, when you’re up 150 and you finish at 28.2% OP margin for industrial flow control businesses, I can’t take my hat off enough to the quality of the people we have and the niches we’ve chosen to serve. Medical and scientific imaging, sales were up 11%, OP was up 14, and margins were up 50; and then energy systems and controls was up 19% with OP up 31 and margins up to 50. Overall, the team produced 13% organic growth. They feel quite good about going into 2012, and the broad-based margin expansion we enjoyed this year, we think will continue next year. Next slide – so here we’ll look at the smallest segment as a function of the total of 21%, is medical and scientific imaging. They had an unusual fourth quarter just mathematically – we’ll talk about it- but really the story is the medical growth continues with even better prospects at Northern Digital than we originally identified. Got significant OEM business that we believe is coming online in 2012. We had organic sales decline in the fourth quarter, really caused by two primary events: we had lower camera sales for an original equipment manufacturing video conferencing series of things that go on with one particular large client, and they were in decline this past year and the fourth quarter really brought that to a head; and then our rugged mobile computer shipments, which we rarely talk about because it’s certainly not the key to our medical or scientific imaging business, but they enjoyed unusual activity in the fourth quarter last year with their rugged mobile applications into certain overnight shipping arrangements, and those really waned this year in the fourth quarter. We had very strong margin performance in the fourth quarter against an all-time record last year in the fourth quarter, so we wound up with 25% OP in the fourth quarter. For the full year, you can see sales were up 11%, OP 14, and margin up 50. As we look to 2012, what we see in the segment is that medical growth, we expect to continue. We have several new product launches that are occurring, generally starting in Europe and then coming into North America. We expect those to provide a lift in the second half of the year. We’ll get the benefit of some growth from the Northern Digital acquisition in the first part of the year, and then it will turn into organic growth in the second; but we expect a very strong first quarter from Northern Digital. We’ve got significant backlog in the scientific imaging arena that supports modest growth of the year. It’s certainly going to be probably the low point of 2012 organic growth for Roper; but that said, given fears around research funding, as we’ve gone through our planning reviews with people, people seem reasonably confident and certainly the physical science aspect of this looks better than the molecular and biological aspect does. But on balance, it should be a net gain for us in 2012 and we are confident we’re going to have margin expansion from growth in the other arenas. Next slide – we look at the energy systems and controls. Here, you can see just virtually all of the divisions here, with the exception of Zetec’s nuclear steam-gen activity, have had very strong growth across the segment. They all had record margin performance. We continue to get our diesel engine shut-off systems that we’ve talked about frequently—continue to grow at a very rapid pace. We don’t see any pullback in that area. We have had record results, really, for compressor controls, primarily due to the continuing expansion projects around the world; and you can see for the full year, our revenue was up 19%, OP up 31, and margin up 250. To have OP in the fourth quarter at 30.5% is really quite substantial performance. If you look at 2012, we don’t really see any headwinds here. We would expect that this segment ought to grow the fastest of our four segments in 2012. It’s got major drivers, none of which are waning in any way with the oil and gas markets remaining favorable. Compressor Control has a backlog that assures its success for the year.  The bolt-on acquisitions, which we haven’t talked a lot about because they’re small – United Controls done earlier this year – gives us access to very substantial OEMs that we haven’t been involved with in the past. Trinity is a software company in the U.K. that’s just coming onboard now. It’s modest revenue but it gives us a lot of technology and it’s going to allow us to get compressor control even more embedded in software activity. And then Hao Ying is a Chinese company; it’s our first Chinese acquisition that we acquired for Dynisco. Dynisco is enjoying very nice growth. Probably everyone is aware that tire manufacturing CAPEX is doing well, and the things that Hao Ying can do for us in China are similar to what we do in the U.S. We have a lot of new products coming online, and having our own in-house manufacturing capability and distribution channel reach directly in China for the rubber industry is quite useful for us.  Next slide – here if we look at industrial technology, fourth quarter was up 20% in sales, 25% in OP, margins at 29.2%. Let’s not be confused – those are not gross margins of an industrial company, those are the operating margins of our flow control businesses. Fluid handling, very rapid growth from new customers, expanding oil and gas markets here. Certainly fracking is driving a significant portion of our growth. Very important indicator for us – our material test business is headquartered in Denmark, along with the Dynisco business I just mentioned, were two of three indicators that late in 2008, about the downturn for ’09 that were people going to experience, and they finished the fourth quarter at a very strong rate – up over 20%. Dynisco finished very strong as well, so we haven’t seen any sign of any deterioration in forward activity. Neptune is continuing to grow in the U.S. despite the concerns that we and others would have had about the municipal market, and the fourth quarter was favorable for Neptune and we delivered both growth and execution with these record margins. Full year, you can see sort of similar – 20% in the fourth quarter, 21 for the year, OP up 29, margin up 150 basis points. For this coming year, we really don’t see anything that’s going to arrest the trend. The major drivers – we get a big benefit from the Toronto project at Neptune, which will roll out more rapidly in 2012 than it did in ’11. We don’t see any pullback in any of our flow control businesses, and then we have new product and material tests that ought to allow that to continue to grow, so we think it will do nicely in the high end of any range we’ve established for organic growth. Then we look at the RF technology business, and here in the fourth quarter we had sales up 4%, OP up 12, and significant margin improvement – up 190 BPs. The organic was flatter than—it was far better than what it looks here because we had the completion of the France technolog—Gaz de France automated meter reading project, which was completed; so from a revenue viewpoint, it helped us all year, but in the prior year it had been in the bookings so that was sort of an artificial headwind on a comparative basis. We had very strong toll tag shipments that offset somewhat less project work in tolling in the fourth quarter, but we continue to have growth in our software as a service subscription and software maintenance businesses. We had really a terrific contribution throughout the year from our college campus software and integrated security solutions out of CBORD. They accounted for a significant portion of our growth in the full year, and importantly you can see the full-year sales growth for RF was up 17%, OP up 35, and margin up 300. We’re encouraged about margins in general in RF, so when we look to 2012, what we see is continued growth in the software and SAS businesses that we have. We think toll project and maintenance growth will be stronger next year while tag shipments will be lower. We have this headwind that we have to get through with the Gaz de France project that won’t recur, although we’ll have ongoing service with it; so that will be a drag into 2012. But the operating margin expansion that we expect to see by having the software businesses becoming a bigger portion of the segment and the backlog that we have in this segment gives us confidence that we’ll produce both more cash and operating profit in 2012 in RF. Next slide – here as we get into the 2012 guidance – next slide – the full-year guidance for us is 467 to 487, and the assumptions around that is that organic growth would be up from a 5% at the low end of the range to 8% or more at the high end of the range. Last year, we said 9 to 11, I believe; this year 5 to 8, given all the uncertainty in the world, seems like a rational approach to this. We’re assuming currency is the same as it was at January 31, 2012. The tax rate, we’re assuming is going to be about 30%. Share count creeps up a little bit from 98.5 million diluted shares to 99.5 million. First quarter, we’d see coming in between $1.01 and $1.05; and full-year operating cash flow should exceed 650 million in 2012. I’m sure some people worry – we haven’t commented much about Europe in here. It’s not overly significant for us. We don’t see much difficulty in Europe. Our businesses there are often exporters to emerging markets, so we remain pretty comfortable with what’s happening in Europe. Next slide – if you look at the 2011 summary then, we had an all-time performance record for orders and sales, net earnings, cash flow, and EBITDA. We had terrific margin leverage—you know, when we look back on the year, one of the things I didn’t cover that’s worth really talking about in the income statement is if we look at the difference, we were up—operating income reached 661 million, up from 514, so that’s 147 million up in operating income while sales were up by 411 million. You take that 147 OP and divide it by an incremental 411 in net sales, and you get operating profit leverage of 36%. So our leverage is still world-class and we expect that to continue in 2012. Operating cash flow at 602 million speaks for itself. Twenty percent free cash flow to sales – I don’t think you can find people doing that, and our family of businesses and our end markets are continuing to look quite reasonable for 2012, so we expect to have another record year in 2012, and we certainly are off to a good start. So with that, John, I think we’re open for questions.
John Humphrey: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. We will now go to our question and answer session of the call. If you would like to ask a question, you may do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your touchtone telephone. We ask that our callers limit their questions to one main question and one follow-up. We’ll take our first question from Matt Summerville with Keybanc.
Matt Summerville – Keybanc: Good morning. A couple questions – first, Brian, can you talk about in your oil and gas-related businesses, whether or not a reduction in gas rig counts, an increase in oil rig counts – is that good for Roper, not good, or are you guys indifferent to that? And then I have one follow-up.
Brian Jellison: You know, Matt, we’re probably indifferent to that, although it’s probably a little bit better for us on the oil side than on the gas side. We have products that are used on both of those applications, and as Roper Pump in particular, they’ve continued to expand their new products and in fact have worked with our Dynisco business on some polymer technology for one of their power sections, which allows that to be utilized in downhole oil applications as well as what they’d been doing previously for gas applications.  So we’re largely indifferent to that, but also remember an awful lot of this is about building the base and expanding into some channels that we hadn’t been in before, so it’s not only the growth in the drilling activity overall but also some good channel development that those guys have done.
Matt Summerville – Keybanc: And then can you sort of what through the same thing, specifically talking about Compressor Controls, more around kind of the application-specific things that are driving what Brian seemed to describe as a backlog that gives you very good visibility through the year. Is this mostly—are you seeing good replacement or retrofit activity, or is this new capacity? And can you talk about what you’ve been doing maybe on the power side of that business as well?
Brian Jellison: Well, generally what happens with us is while we do OEM to certain very well-known manufacturers, most of our business is aftermarket business so we get a whole lot of several year out from new CAPEX activity where people want to see us deploy better technology for their controls than perhaps they had in the original purchase. It’s just a phenomenon that’s not unusual, so people who are looking for productivity or more throughput or less consumption of the gas in the pipeline frequently are going to choose us. That business, we’ve really become quite effective in distribution channels around the world and are sort of growing in China as well, so we really have—anybody who wants to have LNG operations that are as efficient as possible in getting the least consumption of gas inside their gas turbines is likely to look to us as a solution provider. That reputation just continues to build, so from an aftermarket perspective, the projects that we get a bid on—I mean, it would be not the least bit unusual for us to have six months of backlog at Compressor Control and known service work that’s going to fill things up.  In fact, we completely redesigned our Des Moines headquarters last year, created a much, much more engineering-oriented facility that gives people an opportunity to work in teams in a very different way. It’s certainly among our most exciting businesses we’ve got, just world-class human resources in that business. We’re at the early phases of our growth, frankly; and good heavens, if we got to exporting gas and LNG, it would be phenomenal what will happen to our business in that area.
Matt Summerville:  Thanks a lot.
Operator: And next we’ll go to Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research:  Good morning, gentlemen. Congrats on the quarter and year.
Brian Jellison: Hey, good morning Mark.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Let me talk about the medical – obviously there’s some weakness in the whole segment, but you had some tough comps. But what degree is that attributable to some product introductions? You mentioned you have some new products rolling out in the back half, so does that keep people on the sidelines a little bit? And what gives you a—
Brian Jellison: No, no. These are not substitution products at all. These are entirely new products, but we’ve had an ongoing ramp-up on certain kinds of positioning devices for MRI technology, we’ve got new products in Verathon around GlideScope. We have this Heartscape product that we’ve launched in Europe that we haven’t brought into the U.S. at all yet. We have a product called AortaScan that is a phenomenal product. All these things are just ramping up – in fact, we have an international sales meeting starting Sunday night with the Verathon people for three days to try to gear it up. We had a similar situation last week with our CIVCO people around growth opportunities outside the U.S., so we’re quite comfortable with that. And really, any—this organic stuff in Q4 has really not affected medical much in any way. Medical is still performing very well. We expect it will continue to do that. This is really much more about a business that we have stuck inside scientific and imaging because it just doesn’t fit anywhere, and that business had a really strong Q4 last year which is quite unusual, and it had its more normalized weak results in the fourth quarter of this year. So that’s—rugged mobile has for a long time been not a typical Roper business in terms of performance, but we’ve got a lot of energy in that business and people are hopeful for a much brighter 2012.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Okay, thanks. And then moving to industrial tech, I mean, it actually accelerated growth versus the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. I assume a lot of that is due in large part to the fluid handling, the material test. And then looking in material test, how much of that is automotive driven – excuse the pun – and what do you see going into ’12?
John Humphrey: Well, I mean, the derived demand for that business is really anyone who is utilizing or looking to understand their material contents better; and so as one can imagine, that does include one who is making steel or aluminum or other types of really hard surface materials. So there is obviously some impact from automotive production and for the supply chain, even though we don’t really sell very much to any of the automotive companies, or even the Tier 1 automotive suppliers directly. We have some sales there, but that’s not the primary end market. But clearly the fact that automotive production has come back in 2011 and is expected to grow again in 2012, I think is adding some benefit for our material test business.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: And is it safe to say that the non-Neptune businesses probably outperformed Neptune in the quarter?
John Humphrey: No, I don’t think that’s fair. I don’t think that’s—
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Probably on a quarter-to-quarter, maybe year-to-year.
John Humphrey: On an annual basis, the answer is yes. For the quarter itself, I mean, Neptune continued to do very well; and remember, we are ramping up with the Toronto project, which did give us some additional revenue in the fourth quarter, and that will continue into 2012 and ’13 and ’14.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Okay, thank you.
John Humphrey: You’re welcome.
Operator: Next we’ll go to Deane Dray with Citi.
Deane Dray – Citigroup: Thank you. Good morning everyone. For the orders this quarter, it’s rare that we’d see a book-to-bill below 1; and Brian, as I recall, any time this has happened – it really hasn’t happened for, like, 10 quarters – you bring out these historical references about any time you’re below 1. You can see—you get some one-off comments, but then look at the trend that comes back. We didn’t hear that this time. You gave a little bit of the comp issue, but just put this in perspective about the order activity, bid activity, some of the leading indicators; because this is a little bit of an anomaly to see you below 1.
Brian Jellison: Yeah, well not below 1, Deane. I think what we’ve said is from 0.97 to 1.03 is kind of a band that we would have, and routinely—oh, I don’t know what percentage, a very high percentage of the time we’re between 0.97 and 1.03. But we had some unusual situations in Q4 last year – the large Mexico City project that we revealed to people in industrial in fourth quarter from an order perspective, and then obviously wouldn’t repeat in the fourth quarter this year. So that alone explains most of the book-to-bill in industrial. And then RF is a lumpy situation – book-to-bill in RF was weak at, like, 0.9 or something like that. We’re not really worried about that. We have huge backlog in RF and the non-toll project activity is quite robust going into 2012, so it’s not much of a factor. If we had a poor book-to-bill in the first quarter, then we’d be talking more about that; but we wouldn’t have established organic guidance at 5, 8% or more if we were really worried about the book-to-bill. But it’s a fair thing to point out because normally we would expect it to not be worse than 0.97. This time, it was 0.94; but there were these three unusual events with cameras and rugged mobile and Mexico that aren’t really core to the overall nature of activity. So the rest of it was much more in our wheelhouse.
Deane Dray – Citigroup: Okay. And for my follow-up, we pay attention to how you craft the expectations regarding M&A in a strongly above-average year, both in terms of fire power within the balance sheet. But take us through what you’re seeing in the pipeline, pricing, and in particular if opportunities to add on medical – there’s big leverage to be able to drop in a new medical line into an existing sales force. My question there is are you restricted at all as to what type of medical products that need to be complementary to some of your existing surgical products, or can you go into some newer areas on the medical side? Thank you.
Brian Jellison: Well, we have kind of three different sales forces that are available to us, so at the low end you have the overnight delivery people with consumables and telephony-driven responses with hospitals around the world, and that—we’re extremely competent in that area with the right call centers, right SKU sorting, almost a mini-distributor function. Then we have the technical cell around radiation oncology, which is a unique specific trait calling on a very small niche in the hospital and has to really be joined at the hip with major OEM manufacturers that are involved in that equipment. And then we have the third sales force, which is the Verathon sales force, which is more generic; but they’re selling products that are in the thousands of dollars, not the hundreds of thousands of dollars, not really CAPEX for the most part. Those people have very specific people they call on. It’s organized into an acute care activity and a private practice activity. It’s easy for them to add things in those two areas. Increasingly, we’re investing outside the U.S. in channel presence, and that’s doing really well. So it is certainly possible that we can do a bolt-on acquisition and take advantage of our existing sales force in that area; but we look at a lot of things in medical, and I’d have to say a number of the things that we look at are in software in medical, and we find those to be exceptionally exciting.
Deane Dray – Citigroup: And just in terms of expectations, how close do you think you are to making some announcements on the M&A side?
Brian Jellison: Well, you never know. You just—you never know. I mean, we’re sitting here with a lot of capacity, which is matched by a lot of patience. So our goal is to buy things at the right price, at the right time, and have the right people in place to monitor them. One of the things we did last year, which was very important strategically, is add two new very senior resources. We brought Neil Hunn in to focus on medical activity. Neil’s an M&A pro, former CFO of a publicly-traded company running a revenue business in medical, just a world-class guy. But we wanted to marry him up with a world-class software guy. We brought Joe Bergera in, who has worked for Wolters Kluwer and Sage for his career. Joe’s a domain expert around architecture, platforms and software, and trying to get our software to leaders, more capable, doing more bolt-ons and activities. So we have dramatically enhanced our internal capability to assimilate both software and medical companies, which we really needed to do. I think the rest of us here in Sarasota were only interested in doing transactions that brought world-class management teams and didn’t take too much more of our time, so now that we’ve really beefed up our capability in this area, we have a lot more firepower intellectually than we did in the past. Fortunately, that matches our balance sheet.
Deane Dray – Citigroup: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: Good morning. I’d like to just continue that last topic. You mentioned software as being an area of focus, and on acquisitions; and historically, Roper has acquired companies that were often converting from old analog technology to new digital technology, and that involved a lot of new software-driven equipment, so that the software really was an integral part of the equipment business that you were in. That started with CCC, which by the way I was happy to hear that you think you’re still in the early phases of growth with CCC, given that you acquired it almost 20 years ago. In September of 1992, it was 17 million in sales, so at this point after 20 years, it’s pretty impressive to be in the early phases of growth. But it’s software-driven, mainly, very—equipment is only a small part of it.  So going forward, are you really going to go into standalone software, or are you going to just continue to acquire equipment businesses that have a high component of software? Could you clarify that?
Brian Jellison: Well, no, it will be both. If there was sort of one core in Roper that unifies the enterprise, it would be algorithms. Every one of our businesses almost is dependent on some kind of algorithmic technology and feedback mechanism for people for data, and so that’s almost always the core of something. But our recent acquisitions, many of them have been pure software plays. Certainly iTrade and CBORD and Horizon back in ’04, or freight matching which was a core portion of what we wanted to acquire when we did the TransCore transaction, and of course it’s now split off into a separate company. We acquired another company called Getloaded, pure software. They have a link up in Canada, pure software. Certainly a lot of the acquisitions that we’re moving through the pipeline now are software-driven things. You know, I think every once in a while we’ll look at an equipment business, but for the most part the software businesses or the digitization of analog businesses, as you pointed out, are more attractive in terms of a shareholder return on a cash-on-cash basis. Our--
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: Oh, absolutely. But—go ahead.
Brian Jellison: --just spectacular the last several years.
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: But still, your—this is software for Roper equipment, not software for somebody else’s equipment.
Brian Jellison: No, that’s true. We’re not—it’s not like Rockwell Automation or something, no. We’re not doing software for other people’s products. When we’re saying software, we’re doing software for other people who manage the cash in their channel; so if you look at what CBORD does, it’s software that’s managing campus activity and monetizing activity, and showing people what the flow looks like. When you’re looking at Horizon, it’s pure software, no products, providing cash register support mechanisms and telling people about the supply chain. When you look at freight matching, it’s pure software subscription model where thousands and thousands of people are looking every minute about available freight movement. When you look at iTrade, you’re looking at people sorting through supply chains so that vendors can sell to supermarkets. We like networks, as such, and we continue to look at software companies that provide niche networks to people.
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: Okay, thank you. Second question is this – EPS last year for the year as a whole was up 29.9%, and that was well above your average rate; and of course, you also had some headwinds like higher tax rate and so on. But guidance for this year is only 9.9%, less than 10% above 2011. Actually, it’s a little bit higher than the consensus, which was looking for a 9.5% increase, so it’s not a big surprise. But one of the reasons could be that you didn’t make very many big acquisitions last year, so you have to depend more on the organic growth this year; but also are there any big headwinds that you’re—could you just go over the things that made last year above average and might be responsible for making this year below average in terms of EPS growth? Because I think investors are kind of looking for a continuation of the long-term trend, which is about 20%.
Brian Jellison: Well yeah, you know, the long-term trend certainly includes acquisitions; our guidance doesn’t, so it’s that simple. So if you’re looking at—
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: But you’re going to make very many—
Brian Jellison: Right, so you don’t have them rolling in so much into 2012. The last three years, we’ve done about 1 billion, 1.25 in acquisitions, and we’ve generated cash of about 1.4 billion. So we’ve reinvested our cash at about a 75% clip into acquisitions, and the next three years – good heavens, we’re giving one-year guidance at 650, so obviously we’d expect well over $2 billion in cash in the next three years, so that it’s easy to see how that will carry. When that does, you’ll get a lot more revenue so the overall revenue will be going up. So in any one year, you can’t look at a step change; you have to look at what it is over time. We don’t see any disruption in any long-term trends around Roper. I think we’re going to just continue to have compound growth that’s favorable, just it doesn’t look like organic growth on an acquisition until a year later.
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management: Right. Yeah, what were some of the things, though, that last year might have in addition to not having acquisitions to roll in this year but might have made last year a tough comparison with this year?
Brian Jellison: Well, you had record performance last year. You’re looking at lousy GDP around the world. You’re looking at people who are terrified about a whole variety of end markets. Our organic growth in the fourth quarter, I think is best in class. Our projection around organic growth for 2012, I haven’t seen anybody projecting 8% or more; so if we were simply at the high end of our organic growth and we captured the kind of leverage we expect to capture, we have more like 13% diluted earnings per share year-over-year variance, Alex, and that’s without acquisitions. So I don’t think we’re going through the year without acquisitions. So if you said can you get several points out of earnings related to acquisitions, the answer is yes. So yeah, I don’t think it’s—to go back over all those things that were favorable, we kind of—we’re doing that in the slides. If you look at our statements going into ’12, we aren’t really describing any deterioration. All you’re doing is having a slower rate of organic growth based on an abysmal global GDP forecast and fears people have in Europe, so we’re hoping not to participate in those negatives.
Alex Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management : Yeah, thank you. If you average the two years, it’s right in line with your historic. Okay, thanks very much.
Brian Jellison: You’re welcome.
Operator: Next we’ll go to Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs. 
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Morning, gentlemen. 
Brian Jellison: Good morning, Terry.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Wondering if we might be able to just help us with some color on where your organic expectations for the segments are, relative to the 5 to 8% for the year. It kind of sounded from your comments like perhaps energy and industrial may be above the high end of the range, or at the high end of the range, and maybe RF and medical at or below the low end of the range. But maybe you can put a finer point on that color.
Brian Jellison: Hey, I think we’re still expecting double-digit growth out of energy and industrial in terms of organic growth in 2012, and then the bottom end of the range on medical and imaging and only modest growth out of RF because of the tolling activity, which is a big piece of that, with other stuff growing. We’ve got a few things that affect us there in RF because we have that headwind around the Gaz de France project, so you take out 30 million or whatever it is out of that, it’s a big chunk that you have to beat up. And so we actually—if you were adjusting for that, we’d have growth even there. So—and it’s our first guess out of the box, right, that 5 to 8. So clearly the industrial and energy segment will drive, but particularly energy is going to drive outperformance in 2012.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Okay, and Brian, maybe how are you thinking about the first quarter or cadence through the year? Do you start stronger and end up a little slower towards the end of the range, or do you think it’s even through the year, or how do you feel about that?
Brian Jellison: I don’t know, Terry. It’s hard to say. I mean, we’re expecting maybe 6 to 8% organic growth inside our guidance for the quarter with $1.01, $1.05 with really strong leverage. Whether it could be better than that, it’s hard to say. I think we were impressed as we went through our year-end reviews with people that if you didn’t have all the headline news and you didn’t have the political environment and the conversations that are going on, our people would be probably be forecasting better results because they’re seeing really excellent results. They’re not seeing a big fall-off in anything, but it tends to make everybody conservative.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then I know there’s a lot of noise, as you mentioned, in the 4Q orders; but I’m just wondering if you were to try to strip out the noise, can you give us a sense for how the order trends were through the quarter – in other words, did you end up stronger than you started, or was it a strong start and a weak finish?
Brian Jellison: Hm, no, I don’t think—I wouldn’t say month-to-month was a big difference. I think the thing that we would have liked to have seen a little more year-end buying than we got in the fourth quarter that’s just residual MRO activity – people have money left in their budgets – and particularly in energy, it’s not at all unusual for us to get disproportionate mid-Q4 orders for instruments because it’s just something people can do when they don’t want to lose their budget. I think their activity throughout the year was so strong that they didn’t have that leftover money, and so we didn’t see that dynamic that we frequently see. But I don’t think it has anything to do with Q1 demand or 2012 demand. I think it’s just that it was so strong all year long that people didn’t wait to buy things.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then just lastly, one more on medical – Brian, I guess I’m just trying to discern, is there any element of the revenue miss in the quarter—at least, I perceived it missed your expectations a bit - maybe you could calibrate that - that was just related to timing; in other words, it slipped by a couple of weeks or something like and that’s part of what gives you the confidence on the Q1, despite the little bit softer order trends in the year-end.
Brian Jellison: Well, in the segment in medical and imaging, we have our very high end optics and imaging business that had a record year that didn’t ship everything in Q4 that we would like to have seen, for a variety of reasons that I think we expected to have a banner 2012. But it was more the unusual comp situation where we had basically laboratory camera technology that was going into Asia that was a one-off thing that couldn’t be repeated, and then just frankly, without mentioning the company, the video conferencing business for that enterprise went down dramatically. They’ve talked about it in their own company, and it pulled down us, which makes for an easy comp for 2012 for us, frankly.
Terry Darling – Goldman Sachs: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Next we’ll go to Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Thanks. Brian, I’m impressed—it sounds like—I think I heard you have a sales meeting during the Super Bowl Sunday night. 
Brian Jellison: You know, I have a feeling that when that was scheduled that they perhaps missed the significance of the day, Chris. And the amazing thing is it’s not in Indianapolis. It’s actually in the northeast, so it will be quite interesting.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Yeah, someone will bring a transistor. So you called out the scientific imaging as maybe the low point of organic growth for Roper, along with another number of companies, but doing particularly well. But just looking for some color, maybe you put too fine a point on that. Just wondering maybe about TransCore and Neptune ex-Toronto, how those trends are?
Brian Jellison: Well certainly Neptune ex-Toronto is better than we expected, and maybe John wants to provide a little color on that.
John Humphrey: Sure.
Brian Jellison: I think it’s the rugged mobile thing which is certainly not a core asset that really had the very difficult comp measurement. But why don’t you talk about that?
John Humphrey: Yeah, as far as some of the other units you were asking about there, Chris, Neptune continued to do extremely well during the year, and they’ll get continued benefit out of Toronto; but even excluding Toronto, they were up kind of in the mid-single digits in 2011 in the U.S., which I don’t think most people looking at the municipal market would have expected something like that. So I think Neptune did a very nice job there, and then of course with the high degree of recurring revenue that comes out of our TransCore toll and traffic business, that is a business that will naturally kind of be in the mid-single digits also, and that’s kind of what it did in 2011. And then variation that we see in that business is largely due to the timing of tag shipments, based upon when customers are going to replenish their inventory. They’ve done a nice job outside the U.S., our toll and traffic business has, with the expansion of electronic tolling opportunities in Puerto Rico, and continuing with the largest tolling project in the world in Dubai. So we have a nice global footprint there and a large installed base that gives us a lot of visibility and good recurring revenue.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Okay. My question was a little more forward-looking than the answer, but I appreciate the great color. Is that kind of a trend you’d expect to continue, and just—it sounds like Neptune probably just continues to execute on market share domestically.
John Humphrey: Yeah, I think that’s right; and also of course, Toronto ramps up in 2012. And far as the toll and traffic business, I mean, as Brian said, to the extent that we’re at the 5 to 8% for the enterprise, we’d expect that to be at the lower side but with good margin performance.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And next we’ll go to Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Yeah, just my two questions here – in the energy systems and controls business, just curious – were there any missed shipments in that segment in the fourth quarter? I would have thought maybe revenue should have been a higher, given the bookings number through nine months in ’11.
John Humphrey: No, I don’t believe so.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Okay, so that kind of met revenue expectations?
John Humphrey: Uh-huh.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: And then also in industrial tech, a little bit curious – I would think you had a good quarter out of Toronto—Neptune, Toronto. I was just curious – is it mix that maybe pulled the gross margin in a little bit year-over-year? What accounted for that?
John Humphrey: You are exactly correct.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Okay, so that’s primarily Toronto, then?
John Humphrey: And you will notice, of course, that even though the gross margin may be a little bit lower in the segment, the operating margin continues to expand.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: I did notice that, yes. And then lastly, one thing on the—if we could just double back to iTrade for a second in RF Tech, you made some investments in Europe there and made some investments in the forward growth expectations. How does that play out in ’12 – are you seeing some visibility on the payback on those growth investments in iTrade?
Brian Jellison: Absolutely. I think that we have one large turnkey operation that’s going more slowly than we’d like and more customer-driven, so we’d like to see the pace of that pick up where more people are required to go online there. But there’s not—it’s kind of their pace. There’s not much we can do about that. But we’re certainly looking forward to an even better 2012 in iTrade than we had in 2011.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Okay, okay. Very good. Thank you.
Operator: And that will end our question and answer session for this call. We’ll return to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Okay. Thank you, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you after the end of our first quarter. 
Operator: And that does conclude today’s conference. We thank everyone for their participation.

Operator: The Roper Industries’ Third Quarter 2011 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. Just a reminder, today’s presentation is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
John Humphrey:  Thank you, Becky, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our record third quarter. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We've prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast, and also available are on our website at www.roperind.com. Now, if you please turn to Slide 2, we'll begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as detailed more fully in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now, if you please turn to Slide 3. I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Roper's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian D. Jellison: Thank you, John, good morning everybody. We'll start off with a quick overview of the Q3 financial results and then talk specifically about the segment performance and outlook for the fourth quarter, update you on our guidance summary and then I’ll open it up to questions and answers. So, first slide. If we look at the Q3 financial results, once again, they were an all time record for any quarter in the history of the company, not just a record third quarter. Orders were at the highest level and history sale is the same. Backlog, the highest level, net earnings, the highest level, and operating and free cash flow in the quarter set a new standard for the company. Our total sales in the quarter were up 18% and organic sales were up 13%, which was frankly better than expected. Our book-to-bill was greater than 1.0 for the ninth straight quarter, and our record backlog of $876 million is up $106 million from the third quarter a year ago. Operating margins were terrific throughout the enterprise. They were up 230 basis points so that operating margin was 23.5% of revenue in the quarter. Our EBITDA was $203 million in the quarter, which is a fairly astonishing number by any standard, and EBITDA margin was 28.6%. Our operating cash flow was 23% of sales at $167 million, and our free cash flow was 22% of sales at $157 million. Next slide. If we look at the income statement, you can see bookings again were above 1.0 at 1.01. Net sales were, as we said, up 13% organically. Gross profit picked up 50 basis points from a year ago. Our operating income was up 30% from $128 million to $167 million, and margin at 23.5%, up from 21.2% in the third quarter a year ago. Our tax rate was actually a headwind in the quarter. In the third quarter last year, it's only 25.9%. As most of you would know third quarter results tend to have whatever rollover there is in 1040A calculation for filing tax returns. This year our tax rate was 27.7%, a 180 basis points increase over the prior year, which took a couple of pennies out of our results. Net earnings were $110 million, up 31% from the prior year, and our diluted earnings per share were $1.12 versus $0.87. Next slide, free cash flow in the quarter was truly spectacular, 22% of revenue and a 142% of net earnings. This will be the 14th consecutive year that our free cash flow has exceeded net earnings. And really, we had very strong execution throughout the family of businesses, and you can see the comparisons prior-year here on the graph.
 : Next slide, our Asset Velocity performance continues to be best in class. We can see inventory has actually dropped to 7.4% from 8.9% just two years ago. Our receivables are down 200 basis points to 14.7% from 16.7%, just a terrific performance by all of our field operating units around receivables. And payables and accruals have actually come down and our numbers would be even more spectacular. Also in total, when we look at the inventory plus receivables minus payables on accruals, we finished the quarter at 6.5%, that’s 240 basis points better than just two years ago. So our exceptional performance in that category continues. Next slide, here we look at our sort of balance sheet and financial position. We ended the quarter with $246 million in cash. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is $779 million. Our gross debt number is $1.174 billion. If you take that 246 in cash away, you’ve got net debt at $928 million. Shareholder equity continues to be strong there in excess of $3 billion, meeting our net debt-to-net cap numbers about 23%. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA is about 1.5 times, so we have very ample capacity inside anything we’d like to do. And in our EBITDA-to-interest coverage is over 12 times. Now in the last two years we’ve invested $1.1 billion in transactions. But as you can see, the balance sheet is stronger than ever. Next slide, so here we’ll take a look at our segment performance and the outlook for the rest of the year. Next slide, our Q3 segment performance was remarkably similar, you can see EBITDA margins and industrial, RF and medical are over 31% and in energy, they were 29%. The OP margins continue to march forward as we have revenue growth and we capture leverage associated with that, and through out the enterprise we are very happy with the margin performance.
 : Our Freight Matching business grew at a double-digit rate as we’ve got more new subscribers in their very favorable dynamics occurring in the spot market, due to volatility in gasoline prices and driver shortages and truck shortages. Our Toll & Traffic Solutions business, which is less than half of the segment we’d remind people, did well as a result of an upgrade were we’re converting Puerto Rico from a coin based technology to an electronic technology, and we have strong tag shipments in several locations around the world. In the fourth quarter looking forward, we are going to continue to benefit from this Electronic Tolling project in Puerto Rico, our iTrade business enters with a strong backlog and we expect double-digit growth and it will finally be showing up as organic growth here in the fourth quarter for us. The CBORD backlog remains strong enough to assure double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. We expect to get continued margin improvement even given what we had here in the third quarter, we think we’ll do even a bit better in the fourth quarter. And our Technolog operations in France where we’ve been installing a system, we would hope that, that gets completed in the fourth quarter and then in 2012, that will allow us to get our data services revenue, which comes in at lower revenue, but much higher margins. Next slide, here, looking at the Industrial Technology segment, while we often focus on Neptune, because it’s traditionally been about half the segment, growth in the other areas is nothing short of spectacular. Here orders were up substantially above the sales revenue of $185 million. The sales were up 15% from the prior year. Operating profit was up 16%, and operating profit margin in the industrial businesses was 28.2%. Fluid Handling continues to perform just in a very strong manner driven really by all of the shale, gas and oil activity that’s occurring in Canada and the US, lots of new customers and a lot of new applications. New products and strong end markets are also helping our material test business, which is off to a record year by a considerable margin. And then in Neptune, the North American Meter Revenue was relatively flat, but we had strong growth in Mexico and Canada. Surprisingly, the US order flow in the third quarter was up more than 10% in the US. We had a very successful launch of our low profile, lead free residential water meter. A lot of people are crying out to check the shedthelead video that we have and it certainly created a lot of interest in our water meter business. So when we look to Q4, we expect strong seasonality. Generally speaking, we had year-end buys from people in both this and the Energy business and we haven’t seen any trends that would indicate that would not occur again this year. Neptune is going to get double digit growth led by the Toronto Installation Activity, which is going to start to pick up in the fourth quarter and be substantially stronger in 2012. And then our favorable end markets, they are pretty much generally true and so just know we’re not doing well and the 30 plus percent leverage we got in Q3, we would hope will improve even a bit more in the rest of the year and next. If we go to our next slide. If you look here at the Medical & Scientific Imaging segment, it was up 16% in the revenue. Orders actually exceeded sales and orders were up sequentially from the second quarter. Operating profit was up 24% compared to the sales increase of 16%, so we had strong leverage here about 34%. And the OP margin increased to 150 basis points to 24.7. Our high-end imaging solutions, driven largely by Gatan’s quantum and direct detection camera lines are continuing to perform in a fantastic way and we have a new product out there that’s processing frame speeds at 83 gigabytes a second. I'm not sure anybody can relate to just exactly how fast that is, but it’s Bleeding Edge Technology for the most supreme applications in the research area and has added substantially to our growth this year.
 : Our Freight Matching business grew at a double-digit rate as we’ve got more new subscribers in their very favorable dynamics occurring in the spot market, due to volatility in gasoline prices and driver shortages and truck shortages. Our Toll & Traffic Solutions business, which is less than half of the segment we’d remind people, did well as a result of an upgrade were we’re converting Puerto Rico from a coin based technology to an electronic technology, and we have strong tag shipments in several locations around the world. In the fourth quarter looking forward, we are going to continue to benefit from this Electronic Tolling project in Puerto Rico, our iTrade business enters with a strong backlog and we expect double-digit growth and it will finally be showing up as organic growth here in the fourth quarter for us. The CBORD backlog remains strong enough to assure double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. We expect to get continued margin improvement even given what we had here in the third quarter, we think we’ll do even a bit better in the fourth quarter. And our Technolog operations in France where we’ve been installing a system, we would hope that, that gets completed in the fourth quarter and then in 2012, that will allow us to get our data services revenue, which comes in at lower revenue, but much higher margins. Next slide, here, looking at the Industrial Technology segment, while we often focus on Neptune, because it’s traditionally been about half the segment, growth in the other areas is nothing short of spectacular. Here orders were up substantially above the sales revenue of $185 million. The sales were up 15% from the prior year. Operating profit was up 16%, and operating profit margin in the industrial businesses was 28.2%. Fluid Handling continues to perform just in a very strong manner driven really by all of the shale, gas and oil activity that’s occurring in Canada and the US, lots of new customers and a lot of new applications. New products and strong end markets are also helping our material test business, which is off to a record year by a considerable margin. And then in Neptune, the North American Meter Revenue was relatively flat, but we had strong growth in Mexico and Canada. Surprisingly, the US order flow in the third quarter was up more than 10% in the US. We had a very successful launch of our low profile, lead free residential water meter. A lot of people are crying out to check the shedthelead video that we have and it certainly created a lot of interest in our water meter business. So when we look to Q4, we expect strong seasonality. Generally speaking, we had year-end buys from people in both this and the Energy business and we haven’t seen any trends that would indicate that would not occur again this year. Neptune is going to get double digit growth led by the Toronto Installation Activity, which is going to start to pick up in the fourth quarter and be substantially stronger in 2012. And then our favorable end markets, they are pretty much generally true and so just know we’re not doing well and the 30 plus percent leverage we got in Q3, we would hope will improve even a bit more in the rest of the year and next. If we go to our next slide. If you look here at the Medical & Scientific Imaging segment, it was up 16% in the revenue. Orders actually exceeded sales and orders were up sequentially from the second quarter. Operating profit was up 24% compared to the sales increase of 16%, so we had strong leverage here about 34%.

I'm not sure anybody can relate to just exactly how fast that is, but it’s Bleeding Edge Technology for the most supreme applications in the research area and has added substantially to our growth this year.
 : In the third quarter on an order comparison basis we had very tough comps because of two things that happened last year. We do report our Rugged Mobile business in here, which is certainly not keyed to the enterprise, but it had a particularly strong Q3 order for long-term delivery last year, which of course wouldn’t have been repeated in any one quarter and we saw that new initiation of an order. And then, we had very strong dosage delivery business last year and this year it was more normal, so both had created a bit of headwind in terms of the cost. But if you [mask], take that away, their book-to-bill was above one, sequentially higher than second quarter and our backlog is strong, so we don’t expect any difficulty here. In the fourth quarter, we wind up of course with record backlog entering the quarter, so that kind of assures our shipment pattern should be fine. We expect to have continued growth in medical, because the patient treatment and technologies that we’re involved in are continuing to grow. We have a higher fourth quarter, because Northern Digital, which was acquired, will begin to kick in. It has traditionally strong seasonality in the fourth quarter and we haven’t seen anything that wouldn’t suggest that will occur here. Next slide. Here when we get to Energy Systems & Controls, you can see once again, very strong performance. Sales were up 22%, orders were just slightly ahead of sales up 12%, operating profit was up 35%, and our OP margins expanded 250 basis points to 25.7%. Growth again is led by a continued development of the Diesel Engine Safety System technology and that continues to get this US and North American shale activity. We’ve got some new engine OEMs that are building that technology into their platforms and that helps as well. We had a record Q3 in terms of our instrument sales around our refinery business, so that seems to be picking up steam. It had been slow, it had been much better this year but still relatively slow. One of the very few businesses that's not back to the 2008 results, and now that's largely there. We had an expansion in our Alpha and Viatran and Dynisco family of businesses around sensor technologies. They have been up over 30% here for instrumentation to major composites and process manufacturing, and just excellent execution throughout the segment with the exception of our nuclear Tech’s business which has been very soft due to the nuclear plant shutdowns around the world, but fortunately it’s not a big piece of the total. In the fourth quarter, we will benefit from an acquisition that we made right at the end of the third quarter, called United Controls. United Controls is a small business in the Midwest, which has a large OEM component with Rolls Royce. It's got great field service, technical support, and its technology is very complementary to our Compressor Control business. We’ve done very little historically with Rolls Royce and so this gives us a new partner in effect to provide field service and aftermarket application for technology improvements and it certainly expands our OEM channel access. In the oil and gas area, with the trends has continued to perform exceptionally well and there's no downturn of any kind we expected this year or early next. And seasonality here has always been very important. The fourth quarter, there's a lot of MRO purchases that tend to get done in the fourth quarter both residual budgets. We expect that would continue this year, and we also think margins in this segment will expand in the fourth quarter however they were reported in the third. Given all that, we'll look now at the guidance update. Next slide. The guidance, we are increasing our full year guidance from 4.20 to 4.30 to 4.29 to 4.33. Now, we started out this year with guidance of 3.82 to 4.02 and when we look cumulatively, we’ve actually now increased our low-end guidance by $0.47. So at 4.29 to 4.33, that results in Q4 at $1.18 to $1.22, and our full year operating cash flow will exceed $575 million on net leverage. Next slide. If you look at our summary here before we get into the Q&A period, what we have is the best quarter in the history of the company. It’s the highest level of sales orders, backlog, net earnings, operating and free cash flow, ever. Organic sales came in at plus 13%, largely driven by new products and new applications to existing customers and then favorable niche markets. We are really not seeing any slowdown in any activity and any of the things that we might consider to be bellwether items that would say things are getting slower, we’re not seeing that. Very broad-based momentum as we entered the fourth quarter, which has allowed us to increase our guidance. Our gross margin is at 53.7%, certainly best in class, operating margins at 23.5% with 36% overall leverage on new revenue, again, I think probably best in class. Operating cash flow at 23% of sales is nothing short of spectacular. And really a new milestone for us, it’s just as we said, I don’t think people are focused on just how much our EBITDA is growing. But our operating cash flow now in the last two years has exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our history and you think about those acquisitions in the last two years, and the $1.1 billion in cash flow over a $1 billion and as we give you some idea about our capacity in transactions looking forward and the cash machine, that we’ve created here. So with that, I think we’re ready for questions gentlemen.
John Humphrey: Okay. All right, Becky. So if you’ll start the question-and-answer part of the call.
Operator: Thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer portion of the call. (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matt J. Summerville – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Just couple of questions; first, Brian, how are you thinking about the businesses, whether it would be in Imaging or RF Tech or industrial technology the touch areas that or at least in part funded by public sources, municipal sources. How are you feeling about those businesses heading into 2012 and I guess what risks or conversely opportunities do you see in those businesses?
Brian D. Jellison: Well yes. It’s certainly an industrial, you got Neptune that’s selling product to municipal water facilities but we are not really seeing any slowness at all in that arena, so we said our orders are in the US for them, are up over 10% in the third quarter. So that’s really not a problem area for us at the moment. And in fact, I think the municipal funding had start to pick up a little steam with muni bonds. So we were worried about that going into the year and certainly outperformed our peers if not as robust as it was in the past but new products and applications and selling some software along with data clients helps that. In the Imaging arena, you have the NIH situation in the US and then similar situation in Japan, those which people fears a little slow but technologies we’ve launched through our research scientists are so compelling that they really blown through any of that risks. We’re not seeing anything that would be measured as softness. It would be driven by the National Institute of Health funding award or really the Japanese. You see a little more of that actually in Europe than you do here, but nothing that’s much of a headwind. So, that’s actually better than we would have expected. In the radio frequency arena, again the applications we have tend to be cash registers for people. So, they are not really viewed as capital spending. I think it’s a work delivering sort of immediate pay backs for people. We’d be more worried than they are. We certainly performed better in the third quarter on our order and sales basis than we would have expected because we do occasionally listen to the news and managed. If you looked at all the externalities you’d be scared to death. But fortunately, our businesses are so nichy and so specific and value-added that those externalities haven’t had much effect on us at this long. So, we’re not seeing nor does anybody feel fearful about the fourth quarter or frankly next year.
Matt J. Summerville – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, Brian. And then just one more follow-up, can you talk a little bigger picture about what you guys are seeing from an M&A standpoint? It sounded like you are closed on, it sounded at least like a relatively small transaction here within the last couple weeks. How are you thinking about M&A activity kind of over the near to intermediate term, how are multiples trending, what size transactions or businesses are you looking at, how healthy is your pipeline?
Brian D. Jellison: Well, bunch of different questions in there Matt adding to that. I think control is small deal. It’s less than, it’s about $25 million but strategic, nonetheless and very strategic for Compressor Controls, so material to them. Pipeline remains very fully up continuing activity and a lot going on there. I think we’ll be finally seeing a little breakdown in Europe where the European banks are offering very much support for us and not to long ago you're seeing 6.5 times debt staples from those folks and now we’re not seeing any debt staples from those folks, so that had an effect both on the reality and the attitude of people. Debts rating in US have dropped. I think the hard for most people to get a debt funding for transaction more than about five times EBITDA and so that trends the multiple down and so we’re not going to put in our whole lot more equity than they would have before when debt staple was much higher. Furthermore, the strengths for them in that blended cost of their interest, so we get a deal that are higher now than they were if strengths have gone up a bit on masonite portion to debt. So we’re seeing multiples come down a little bit. Our sellers are still, their expectations throughout the year were too high. It’s one of the reasons that with our disciplined approach we haven’t done a large transaction. But we continue to look at a number of large transactions and sometime I think in the foreseeable future we’ll execute on something. Most deals we’re looking at are relatively large and I wouldn’t expect that there is always this kind of the United (inaudible) situation. We could have two or three of those, but we're kind of patiently waiting for the right balance here. People still are worried about CMS reimbursement on medicals. So that's an area you have to be exceptionally careful in. And in the software side, we’ve got things going that we like a lot. And is just a price gap kind of discussion and we're patient and ultimately it's better to be patient. We don't need to do a deal because the deal is available. We need to do a deal because it makes sense for our institutional holders and our shareholders.
Matt J. Summerville – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Next we’ll hear from Deane Dray with Citi.
Deane Dray – Citi: Thank you. Good morning, Brian and John. First question for price cost in the quarter; can you take us through that, and I’d be very interested in how much of that 13% organic was helped by price?
John Humphrey: Well, Dean, it’ll take that one. I mean the way we always look at the price cost equation rather than looking at each of those in isolation, those always have to be looked at in combination with each other. And so what we always track is our gross profit margin. And the fact that gross profits came in at 53.7% and up 50 basis points from where we were at this point last year. It gives us confidence that our businesses are doing the right things with respect to pricing and having up any material cost inflation. As you know, the only real exposure that we have any type of raw material input cost is in copper and it goes into our Neptune business; and Neptune has really done a couple of very smart things. One, with the redesign of the residential water meter, which reduces the amount of material content as well as improves the quality for the customers, which is real positive thing, so that mitigates some of that exposure. And then we also just entered into supply agreements that are usually six to nine months out, which gives us a little bit better visibility and what the cost structure is going to look like on the input side, which allows us to still be able to manage the price equation in a way that doesn’t really drove the customers around all the time in that end market. So those are the things that we look at and so we’re confident that our businesses have done the right things on price cost as long as we continue to have the gross profit margins where we see them.
Deane Dray – Citi: Okay. Thanks helpful. And then just over on the businesses, Brian, hope you can expand on the point regarding the shale gas opportunity and I trust this includes the fracking phenomenon that’s going on. And if I am not mistaken, this opportunity crosses both the Industrial business as well as the Energy business, you know on the dewatering pumps and the diesel engine shut-off. So, what is the opportunity for Roper in aggregate and do these two businesses within Roper combine to have more of a one go-to-market strategy or is it just an individual selling of components?
Brian D. Jellison: Well, it’s all of our Pump businesses Abel, Cornell and Roper have different reason to be involved with fracking and movement. And in addition, Abel does a lot of other thing that are related to municipal water. It’s a German company largely involved in India and Australasia for the most part. Our Cornell and Roper businesses are dewatering and also directional growing and support for the speed in which you can move to drill through the geological issues that are in front of that. Then the diesel shot-off valve is really making sure that all these diesel engines in fact do shut-off instead it continue to run after somebody turn it on. Now we also have a couple other businesses Viatran in Northern New York, which is a sensor related business. It goes into oil and gas and supports some of the technology they need to know about reading information on sensors. So there is really about six different businesses. They don’t go to market under common sales force because it’s not how that business work. So they share customers and talk about things with people, but generally different influences are making buying decisions about it, so you have to call through the channel mostly to the end user or mine itself. And it does get us closer and closer to mining applications, which is increasingly interesting to us.
Deane Dray – Citi: Can you aggregate what the revenue opportunity is for this market?
Brian D. Jellison: Well, I think in total the family of businesses you’re looking at are somewhere in the $200 plus million of revenue growing quite substantially in the 20% range, not the 5% range.
John Humphrey:
 :
Deane Dray – Citi: That’s really helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Next we’ll hear from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Hi, good morning gentlemen.
John Humphrey: Hi good morning, Mark.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: If we can look at fourth quarter John, it look like the orders and backlog support, appears to me double digit organic sales in 4Q, is that the right way to think about it at this point with minimal FX?
John Humphrey: Closer to high single-digits, but never totally about the revenue for us, it’s about the margin discipline and cash, so…
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Right, and then Brian, you’re continuing to drive down working capital to pretty impressive levels, how much is left there, it looks like you’re reaching (inaudible) is that true or what do you think is…?
Brian D. Jellison: Can’t be a lot less, because you know years ago what we said to everybody and they used to throw a ball back for that or switched it. Well if you got to have your payables equal to your inventory and then receivables is really a function of pricing an investment with your customer, and nobody believed it, everybody believes them now. And so when you look at where we are, getting the receivables down to 14.7% of sales was really a level of performance that is never good enough but freaking spectacular. Yes so when you got 40% of your business, not the US to get receivables down to this kind of levels is comforting. I think we’ve got better quality people doing that work down in that clerical and administrative arena. I think there is a real earned knowledge about where you want to invest in collections and the software and technology used to keep real fine data and the customers, and all that has paid big dividends for us. With 6.5% of sales, we’re pretty happy, we were happy at 6.8%, but we only like things to improve.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Thank you
Operator: Next we will hear from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research.
Jeffrey Sprague – Vertical Investment Research: Thanks and good morning everyone.
Brian D. Jellison: Hey, good morning Jeff.
Jeffrey Sprague – Vertical Investment Research: Good morning, Brian, could you elaborate on what’s going on in CBORD, you said the security offering has kind of doubled, was that a comment over the last year and could you give us a little more color on what you're doing there to integrate some of your other RF applications with CBORD trying to bring broader suite to that end market
Brian D. Jellison:
 :
 :
 :
 :
John Humphrey:  And in fact integration is the right word, eventually what CBORD comprise for the customers is a single integrated across a diverse campus that much of software solutions. So you have access control, you also have the ability to have payments in Food Corp et cetera and all of that tie back to a single data base, single integrative real time data base about what a student or a doctor or a nurse had access to at any given time. In fact we have had some opportunities to bring together a variety of the businesses, one of them at major university in the Big Ten area bodes for and in fact in their healthcare solutions so using CBORD as well as our SIFCO business as well as in Ebonics in a way that allows all of those to talk collaboratively together which is a future opportunity which we maybe able to do more of but it really gets to the heart of what CBORD does so efficiently and we look forward to being able to grow that going forward.
Jeffrey Sprague – Vertical Investment Research: Is there where you can give us just some idea to get our head around the scale of the opportunity if you think about maybe your most holistic complete application whether it’s at Miami or somewhere else kind of what your potential value per student, per year or some kind of framework of reference, so we can kind of think about how to model this or get your head around the ultimate occupancy here?
Brian D. Jellison: I think about that you know way to give little more crisp answer the problem when answering the question is that, if you look at where we get like that I wouldn’t think of this a revenue per student because let’s say you are doing Michigan State University, which is a big application for a variety of things at CBORD. You got you know it’s a Big Ten school with thousands of that, but you know it’s not – the incremental cost of a student is exceptionally low and the dollar that we gain for an incremental student is very low. So it’s really how much of the suite of services and data collection technologies they buy that’s critical. So, if it’s a turnkey installation where somebody is putting in electronic locking mechanisms and parking control and food management and recursion management. They are generally they have start out with the portion of the activity or try it in an area as opposed to putting in the entire university. So the system grows over time into a fore mature suite of applications and it becomes valuable. So, it’s really how many new things can you win to sort of get your foot in the door with these people as they build it out. Now we’ve been very fortunate in the last two years to displace another competitor in several locations and we look forward to continuing to do that. And we have an awful lot of sweat for the activity (inaudible) we just finished CBORD User Conference within the last couple of weeks with hundreds and hundreds of people who attend it. And it was over 500 different kinds of people who attend this conference that are thinking about ways to use our software and system data collection technologies in a variety of ways around the campus. So it’s a mind share of thing that drives the growth sort of more than, gosh, I got the largest you ever see in the country. I mean, it could be that the smallest one would get you more revenue than a large one because the amount of seat activity they’re purchasing and the number of cards and applications that they’re applying it to, right. But it’s sort of a long-winded answer, but it’s the truth.
Jeffrey Sprague – Vertical Investment Research: Thank you, that is helpful. And just kind of housekeeping one from me, if I could. John, just thinking about the three points of consolidated M&A and two points of FX, I believe the M&A is more than digital. Is there anything else in any of the other segments and can you give us a little color on the FX?
John Humphrey: iTrade and RF, and Northern Digital is hardly, just a very small piece there.
Jeffrey Sprague – Vertical Investment Research:  Oh, it’s mostly iTrade.
John Humphrey: Well, inside RF, it’s iTrade and inside our Medical and Imaging business, it’s going to be Northern Digital. The other part of your question around the FX, just to kind of go through quickly, the FX by segments, where there is two on a consolidated basis, it was 1% in RF, it was 2% in imaging and then 3% industrial and 3.5% in energy. So really reflective of the more global set of businesses inside energy and industrial whereas RF and imaging really don’t have as much exposure there because of the larger medical footprint, which is still largely US, although lot of growth outside the US in the RF business with the large amount of recurring revenue and at our toll and traffic business.
Jeffrey Sprague – Vertical Investment Research: Great, thank you.
Brian D. Jellison: The way it’s going.
Operator: Next we’ll hear from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Right, thanks. Good morning. Had a question about the iTradeNetwork build-out in Europe, just how that’s progressing and if you want to put the opportunity into some context, we talked about the Shell, the CBORD opportunities developing elsewhere in portfolio, just to kind of get some framework on that opportunity
Brian D. Jellison: Well, we got our first trading office deployment in Europe with this large contract completed successfully in the quarter. So that’s the kind of critical turnkey nature of what happens and then now with that’s in place, we’ll start to see some deployment activity in Q4, which will help drive our double-digit growth that are in that, in that business in the fourth quarter and that of much, much more revenue in 2012 now that you’ve got the first trading deployment underway they should start to roll it out to the vendors. So I think that will be very helpful to us next year. We are still aren’t allowed to talk about who it is because of the sensitivity of the customer that is, it’s among the most significant people in Europe, so we expect it to be long in the future benefits for us.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer:  Great thank you, Brian, and John just what would we expect for the tax rate in the fourth quarter?
John Humphrey: 
 :
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Okay, thank you.
John Humphrey: You’re welcome.
Operator: Next we’ll hear from Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.
Alexander Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC:  Hi good morning.
Brian D. Jellison: Good morning.
Alexander Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC: Could you I missed one figure. What was the initial guidance this year, could you repeat that and then…
Brian D. Jellison: 3.82 to 4.02 Alex is what we established when we had the year end earnings.
Alexander Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC: 3.82 to…
Brian D. Jellison: 4.02.
Alexander Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC: 4.02, okay. Now you mentioned during your opening remarks that CCC Compressor Controls has a I think it was Rolls Royce?
Brian D. Jellison: We just acquired this company called United Controls will be primarily up with Compressor Controls.
Alexander Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC: Right.
Brian D. Jellison:  So United Controls has been doing significant work for Rolls Royce for sometime.
Alexander Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC: Yes.
Brian D. Jellison: And United Controls was available for sale Rolls Royce had a great deal to do with whether or not it could be sold and here would be a lot of buyers. So we were able to do that, and that gives us a value to work with Rolls Royce, which is fundamentally different than what we had from Compressor Controls where we had some work with them in some field work but nothing if I got it ultimate choice. So that is going to give us very interesting build out around things in 2012 that are already committed in United Controls hence then the field service follow on with them will be quite significant to us from a current revenue view point. So it is a really very material transaction for Compressor Controls.
Alexander Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC: Yes and could you just give us little more perspective on it, because when you acquired Compressor Controls in 1992, it was doing almost all its business in the aftermarket. Upgrading compressors that had been sold by OEMs with the OEMs’ controls on them, and it was sight at the time that there was a very large market for Compressor Controls in actually working with OEMs to put the controls on initially rather than retrofitting them later. But that really never developed, because most of these compressor makers wanted to make their own controls and sell their own controls, and it was only 1% or 2% of the cost of the compressor. Anyway, so, I think Compressor Controls continued to operate in the aftermarket. Now is this a change, is this a wedge into the OEM, putting their controls directly on the compressors when they’re shipped from the factory?
Brian D. Jellison:
 :
Alexander Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC: Yes, okay.
Brian D. Jellison: We’ve got dedicated algorithms that are meaningful to the end user of the product where they can lower their seats or increase the speed, manage energy much more efficiently with the use of the turbine and get more throughput at the end. In United Controls, I’d say, I wouldn’t say had a total walk on Rolls Royce, but certainly have been a very significant player for them. And so by acquiring them, we get actually some additional algorithm and specific controls that are useful for Rolls applications just like the other wins that we do for many other people.
Alexander Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC: Okay, so it continues to be the situation that the OEM compressor makers really aren’t providing the most efficient machine that they could provide, and you come along and make it that way, right?
Brian D. Jellison: We can improve on what’s out there. What they provide and for this period of time we would never argue against them, we love them as our customers and are prepared to sell even more to them sooner.
Alexander Blanton – Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC: Okay, thank you.
Brian D. Jellison: Okay.
Operator: Next, we’ll hear from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes, good morning. Brian, could you talk just a minute or two about just the tone of business in Medical & Scientific and maybe the outlook there. I mean, if I kind of do the math with the FX and make an assumption on Northern Digital, I mean it is kind of low single digit core local currency growth this quarter, and we talked a strong backlog maybe entering the fourth quarter, but how do you feel about the tone of business they are going forward with some of the funding and funding issues.
Brian D. Jellison: Well, it’s really been not bad at all. The situation is that, if you look at the life science CapEx type companies out there from those that are reported, they’ve been up about 4% in the third quarter. We’re doing better than that. The reality is that, we had a very large order for rugged mobile which reports in this segment, that was a turnkey situation and if you take that out on both equations and then, we have one particular customer in medical that buys are dosage pumps.
 :
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right. And then, also…
Brian D. Jellison: With that said…
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: … on the Industrial Tech side, just to clarify your comments about Neptune, we had, the business was flat in the US, but strong in Canada and Mexico in the quarter. And the orders, the orders were plus 10% in the US. Is there a reason that you that you saw for the flatness in that third quarter in the US? I mean, it sounds like is it a funding issue or orders were better than sales in the quarter or?
Brian D. Jellison:  No, I don’t think it is a funding issue, I think it’s just a question of timing and the comparison to the prior year. If you kind of take a little bit of a wider lens to those, I mean Neptune, just if you exclude. So we’ve got some very nice wins with both the Canada project, which is continuing, which will give us in the neighborhood of 15 maybe a little more million dollars this year and double that next year, so that will continue to ramp up. We also had nice rewards from Mexico meters, so meters more standard meters going into Mexico, which have a slightly different margin profile, but still a nice win for us. But if you take a wider lens and look at just the US for Neptune, really on year-to-date basis, revenue was up kind of in the mid single-digit range and orders continue to out pace sales. So, I mean it’s just the question of the component they had against the very strong third quarter last year. But on a wider lens looking year-to-date basis, we’re still in a pretty good position there.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, very good. Thank you.
Brian D. Jellison:  Okay.
Operator: Next, we’ll hear from Ben Elias with Sterne Agee
Ben-Ari Elias – Sterne Agee & Leach: Thank you. Good morning.
Brian D. Jellison:  Hey. Good morning, Ben.
Ben-Ari Elias – Sterne Agee & Leach: I have a question, it’s slightly on less sales. You guys have done a great job managing through the ’08, ’09 recession. You know you can see the working capital turns. We are looking at strong organic growth, if we are going into a sort of slow growth environment, could you just walk us through the succession planning that you guys have at Roper, are there anything on your contracts that sort of limit your term in office? And you know for Brian and for John. Thanks.
Brian D. Jellison:  You mean long-term contracts that we have with all of these customers.
Ben-Ari Elias – Sterne Agee & Leach: No, no management contracts.
Brian D. Jellison:  Oh, yeah. We generally don’t have contracts for people. We have long-term compensation programs for people. They are all involved with different forms of stock option and other stock criteria and then there are cash bonus programs that are related to improvement year-over-year in operating income. So if you think about going into any kind of a slow growth environment, one of the reasons our people are so nimble on our opinion is that the only way they earn a bonus to drive continued performance is to get better in the New Year than they were in the prior year. There is no sort of forgiveness for the fact that the market is difficult. So all those guys are prepared to be quite nimble, they have very strong operating people in all of those units and those people are – they understand their compensation better than any of us do, and I think we understand it quite well. So, they are highly motivated about that, and they have a very strong view of how stuff happens. And in the enterprise level, we could have somewhat compensated the same way on a cash basis. So that’s what focuses its attention here, we continue to add modestly to our corporate staff, we’ve got; we’ve strengthened our legal area, our tax area. We brought in a couple new executives this year that are dedicated to corporate development activity and software and medical orientation, so we all have the strongest team of people that we’ve ever had. For myself, I’ve got a long-term best in program on all my equity, so, that continues out to, I don’t know 2014 or 2015 or something, and I would expect that my program of one year update so it continues just like [Walter Alston] for quite some time.
Ben-Ari Elias – Sterne Agee & Leach: So there is no mandatory retirement ages you see in your executives?
Brian D. Jellison:  No, one of the things about a company like us, we don’t have a finishing plan. So when you don’t have a finishing plan, it’s pretty hard to have a mandatory retirement program. So, we do not have a mandatory retirement program. I think the only thing that speaks to that is our board has a mandatory retirement at age 74, and most of them are not yet in their 70’s.
Ben-Ari Elias – Sterne Agee & Leach: Okay, but that’s not for the CEO, CFO and anyone else?
Brian D. Jellison:  None of us here are aware of a mandatory retirement program that would affect us.
Ben-Ari Elias – Sterne Agee & Leach: Okay, thanks for that. Second question, on the diesel engine side that you mentioned you are working with some OEMs they are installing the safety systems on platforms, could you tell us who some of the OEMs are and you know what the sort of lead times on those diesel engines have been?
Brian D. Jellison: Well, I think you wouldn’t be surprised to learn that, when you’re a technology company like we are, and we’re providing OEM technology people, people have no interest in us telling if it’s Intel Inside unless they want to do that. So they’ve guard their own end market brand situation carefully and we are there to protect them in that regard. So we don’t provide information about who is incorporating our technology and that’s always, almost always part of the agreement we have with anyone anywhere. So that’s (inaudible) or the guts of a people’s businesses, you talk to or a team.
Ben-Ari Elias – Sterne Agee & Leach: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And now, we’ll end our question-and-answer session for this call. I would now like to turn it back over to Mr. John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Becky, and thank you all for joining us today. And we look forward to talking to you again in late January or early February as we finish up the year.
Operator: And that does conclude today’s teleconference. Thank you all for joining.

Operator: The Roper Industries Second Quarter 2011 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. This call is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Jennifer, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our second quarter. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes a replay information for today's call. We've prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com. Now if you'll turn to Slide 2, we'd begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information as well as the filings. And now if you'll please turn to Slide 3. I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we'll take questions from our participants. Brian?
B. Jellison: Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. Let me start here with the Slide 3 on my deck. We'll go through the second quarter financial results for the enterprise as a whole and then we'll dissect how the segments performed and what the outlook appears for each of the segment in the second half of the year. We'll talk about raising our guidance and then sort of summarize the quarter and its implications for the future and take your questions. Next slide. The Q2 financial results here are really a spectacular quarter for us. We achieved a series of all-time company historical results around orders and sales and backlog and operating cash flow. And then in the quarter, our net earnings, EBITDA and free cash flow were outstanding.  Total sales for the quarter were up 23% and 16% of that was organic. We enjoyed again double-digit sales growth in each one of the 4 segments, which frankly was a little bit better than we expected going into the quarter. Our book-to-bill ratio is still above 1 for the eighth straight quarter, so that's resulting in continuing backlog. We've got record backlog at the end of the second quarter of $872 million, which is up $230 million from last year's second quarter. Gross margins were very solid in the quarter. They hit 53.9%. And our EBITDA margins, when you exclude this remeasurement gain, which is required to be included here on a GAAP basis, but we've excluded it for looking at our leverage. So the EBITDA margin was up 280 basis points to 28.5%. Without that remeasurement gain, of course, if we left it, the margin would even be better.  NDI's acquisition was completed in the quarter. That's off to a good start. We've already begun the financial integration and had some marketplace meetings with our various people in medical and looked actually at some other acquisitions in that area with them. And then we were pleased to see the Moody's upgrade that we received in the quarter on all of our debt structure to Baa2.  Next slide. On the income statement, there's just not much to say about this, except we achieved another amazingly great quarter. Bookings, you can see book-to-bill at $708 million, it's 1.01 up, our eighth straight quarter. Net sales were $700 million in the quarter. First time we've done that. 23% increase. Gross profit up 70 basis points. Operating income was up 240 basis points from 21%. Second quarter of last year to 23.4% here. Our interest expense was flat. Tax rate in the quarter was actually headwind for us. We came in at 31.4% in Q2 this year versus 29.6% last year and that cost us a couple of pennies. Net earnings again, that's asterisked to show the net earnings number without the foreign currency remeasurement gain in the quarter. It was up 43%. And the diluted earnings per share, $1.03 versus $0.74. On a GAAP basis, it had to be reported at $1.08. Next slide. The free cash flow in Q2 got back to where we expect it -- we'd like to be. We had terrific, terrific results, 21% of sales. Free cash flow was up 41% over the same quarter a year ago with a move up from $103 million to $145 million. Next slide. If you look at the asset velocity performance in the quarter, it's one of the things I know everybody's very happy with inside the company. Despite having a 23% gain in revenue, actually inventory as a function of revenue improved by 10 basis points. So inventory last year was 7.6% of sales. Here, we are up 23% and inventory has dropped to 7.5% of sales. So we're very pleased with our results. Payable is about 5.5% with inventory at 7.5%. We're not having to invest very much to continue to maintain our growth, which is great news. Next slide. If we look at the balance sheet of the company, we can honestly say the balance sheet's never been in better shape. We ended the quarter with $196 million in cash and that's after acquiring Northern Digital for $200 million, by the way. Our available liquidity, including the undrawn revolver at the end of quarter was $753 million, but it'll continue to move up here as we add cash rapidly now. That gives us a net debt of $1,050,000,000. And our net debt-to-net cap, you can see as 26%. We reported here debt-to-EBITDA, meaning gross debt-to-EBITDA because not all of that $196 million is immediately available without repatriation. So the gross debt-to-EBITDA number is 1.7x. If you look at the net debt, which includes all the cash, it drops that ratio to 1.4. Our EBITDA-to-interest expense coverage is about 11x. And despite investing $725 million in the last 12 months, we're really in wonderful shape going forward. And by the way, our trailing EBITDA now on a 12-month basis is up to $739 million. So as the trailing EBITDA grows rapidly, and you look at the debt situation being held constant, the balance sheet gets better and better. Next slide. Now we want to take a look at the individual performance of the 4 segments and what we think they'll look like in the second half. Next slide. Here we're looking at the sort of consolidated segment-by-segment approach on gross margins and EBITDA in the quarter. Everybody at 50% or higher. The industrial EBITDA margins again are just breathtaking at 31%. Just terrific results in the quarter, including handling a portion of our industrial businesses that we'll talk more about. Next slide. We start with RF Technology with the largest portion of reported sales in the quarter at 31% of revenue. You can see orders for RF were up 13%, sales were up 26% and operating margin was up 410 basis points to 24.1%. EBITDA in the quarter for RF, by the way, was 31% as we have a good deal of amortization in RF. The second quarter, we wound up with organic sales of 13%. We had particularly strong growth in the U.K. with our water network monitoring products from Technolog and continued growth in Gaz de France installation project with Technolog in France. We had very strong double-digit sales increases out of CBORD, which was driven by deployments business we won earlier out of college and university environments, and that portion of the business is continuing to do really quite well despite what some people might think. Very strong North American tag sales for transport throughout the second quarter. And then if we look to the second half of the year, we're going to have continued growth in both toll and traffic operations with more tags shipments out of TransCore, but also several traffic projects that we're putting in, in the United States. And then we have a significant expansion of electronic tolling in Puerto Rico where we're going to be converting from coin-operated technologies to electronic collection. CBORD's backlog is very strong, so it's assuring ourselves a double-digit growth throughout the rest of this half of the year and very strong Q3 cash. And iTrade is continuing to do well. We've been encouraging them and investing in them to focus really on their core business on a global basis and that is going well, although we have to continue to beef up the nimbleness of our operations in Europe, which we're doing. Next slide. In industrial technology, you can see we had again a spectacular performance. Orders were up 15%, sales up 26%, operating margin increased 160 basis points to 28.2%. EBITDA was 31% for them as well. We had exceptional growth in all of our pump and water fluid handling businesses, largely driven by oil and gas and irrigation projects. Our materials are used in all the shale activity that you see and we're doing a lot of dewatering and we're doing a lot of drilling support mechanisms for those projects. We have very strong demands for our material test business in Denmark and then we had double-digit growth again at Neptune, which was kind of, I wouldn't say a surprise, but it was pleasant to see because all of the indicators around those businesses would be less than exciting. The next generation residential water meter that we developed at Neptune that some people have seen has been introduced and it's beginning to ship. It has a lower raw material content than our previous water meter had for residential applications, and it's a very easy product to install and incorporate our reading technology. Neptune already meets the 2014 federal lead-free standard associated with the Safe Water Drinking Act. I think this is something that's not talked about enough in the marketplace around just how important and critical that'll be. And we would encourage our investors to go online on YouTube, you'll see at www.shedthelead.com/video/. You'll see a 4 to 4.5 minute thing we put together basically for municipalities to help them try to understand what's going on and while there was this one standard, now there's another standard that has to be lead free. Neptune is the only really producer of lead-free water meters here in the United States. Quite a significant development for us. It's something that we've been working on throughout the last 10 years and feel that it's going to get widespread market acceptance going forward. In the second half of the year, we expect Neptune's momentum to continue, which we would think will do at least as well on revenue in the second half of the year there as we did in the first half, even though in the third quarter, for Neptune, we have extremely difficult comp because last year we had a blowout favorable third quarter. Our order trends and backlog continue to support all of our fluid handling businesses. They -- whether it's Roper or Cornell or Abel or Hansen, any of these are all doing just spectacularly well. New product introductions and a strong Q4 seasonality, we think, will continue to drive or stir us in Logitech [indiscernible] businesses also in the fourth quarter. Next slide. When we look at the energy systems and controls business, here you can see orders up 19%, sales up 22%. The operating margin here was 25.9%, which is up 150 basis points. EBITDA came into the quarter at 29%. In the quarter, virtually all of our end markets were very strong. The diesel engine safety systems that we continue to advertise and push into the marketplace have had continuing growth in their adoption rate with the diesel engine manufacturers. They're going to reach record levels here in this third quarter coming up. The refining and petrochem market is doing much better for us again. Instruments sales have taken off. And then when we look at the sort of global industrial production and capacity utilization around the latex and tire manufacturing and analytics that we do in the rubber industry, those all are doing exceptionally well. And perhaps most importantly, we haven't seen any sign of any slowdown in that business, which, along with material test, have been the kind of 2 leading indicators for us about if there's any softness anywhere. And they both continue to grow. In the second half of 2011, we've got a very strong backlog in energy, which assures our Q3 growth and all the indicators, which suggest a seasonally strong Q4 which is usually our best quarter in that segment.  The control systems business activity certainly should drive our second half record performance here. That activity and backlog has grown at a very fast pace, and shipments ought to start to manifest themselves here in the second half. And we expect continued margin expansion with great leverage throughout the segment in the second half of the year. Next slide. The medical and scientific imaging segment, you can see was up 11% on orders and up 18% on revenue. Operating margin was up 180 basis points to 23.4%. There's quite a bit of noncash amortization here, so EBITDA was 29%. If you look at the medical in the second quarter, pretty much across the line performed very well. We've got faster adoption rates again in BladderScan and GlideScope. We think -- GlideScope is the intubation product. BladderScan is the product that helps avoid catheterization in the hospital, and that has taken off again this year. Very strong ultrasound consumables sales for CIVCO. Northern Digital, we completed that acquisition in the quarter. I will talk a little bit more about that in a second. And then our high-end products that we're driving for photonics that are really around our filters for Gatan and proprietary technology for Princeton are performing well as well. In the second half of the year, if we look at the backlog that we go into, again we're kind of assured a very strong second half. We don't have to rely much on book and ship here. Continued strength throughout the medical platform. We've got the product introductions that Verathon has been working on with Velaport [ph], Heartscape and other products are basically on trend for where we want them to be for our 2012 launches. We think those products will carry our growth soundly into next year.  In Northern Digital, we'll add a little bit of income growth in the second half of the year. It's accretive nominally, maybe $0.01 in Q3 and then stronger in Q4 with $0.03 or so. That acquisition we thought we'd kind of introduce the product to you since we have that chance today and so the next slide here is really a detailed explanation about what Northern Digital does and I've asked John to explain that to you.
John Humphrey: Sure. Thanks, Brian. The Northern Digital acquisition that really adds to our growing medical platform using both sensors as well as cameras is the leading provider for both optical and electromagnetic tracking systems and in minimally invasive surgery where you really had to have very precise application of treatment in a nonline-of-sight situation. You really need to know exactly where the treatment is being applied. And Northern Digital provides the technology and the systems that allow the doctor to be able to do that. And this is really going into a part of the medical market that is growing very quickly around image-guided and minimally invasive surgery. And it really has a couple of different parts to it. You can see it's about 90% medical, and it's about 60% systems and 40% consumables. The consumables are the spheres, these very high-tech optical spheres that really provide the 3D location information back to the doctor. It's a unique and patented technology. It has asset-light business model as all of our acquisitions do. Really comes with a very strong and experienced management team led by Jamie Frazier. And it's once again a very nice addition to our growing medical platform and really in the image-guided part of our medical platform. You'll hear us talk about ultrasound applications with Verathon, ultrasound type of applications with CIVCO. This is another situation where the image-guided surgery is building on that ultrasound technology. So it's a very nice addition for us.  And with that, I'll turn it back over to Brian to talk about the new guidance for the year.
B. Jellison: Thanks, John. We turn that page. So we're raising guidance, most importantly, on our cash flow. We now think that operating cash flow should exceed $575 million for the full year. Our full year DEPS number now is going to be $4.20 to $4.30, which includes the GAAP $0.05 from Q2, and that's up from $3.97 to $4.12 last quarter. In the third quarter, we expect to earn between $1.05 and a $1.09, which is up about 25% from the $0.87 that we earned in the third quarter last year. And I'd remind you actually that third quarter last year was an exceptionally strong quarter. So we think that's quite good performance around the guidance going forward given the strength of last year's third quarter. Next slide. If we look at how Q2 then shapes up in terms of a summary, we wound up with all-time historical quarter performance for any quarter in our history, even better than the fourth quarter of last year for order sales, backlog and operating cash flow. The very broad-based momentum throughout the enterprise, we have a number of small niche P&Ls and almost all of them are up. Total sales growth at 23%, the gross margin up 70 basis points. Operating margin, where you can really see the leverage, was up 240 basis points. So on the incremental, operating margin against the incremental sales, our leverage in the quarter was 34%. EBITDA, because of the noncash amortization that hits the OP margin, EBITDA was up higher at 280 basis points to 28.5% and that excludes the remeasurement gain. Of course, if we kept that in there under GAAP we'd have even higher leverage. So the leverage on EBITDA was 40% of the new revenue. Record backlog ended the quarter at $872 million. We raised the guidance to $4.20 to $4.30. And I think most importantly, when you see what's happening here is that our niche business focus continues to deliver these outstanding results. When so many people concentrate on what are you going to do about the BRICS? What are you doing about that? What are you doing this? Our sales into the BRICS were about 5% of revenue in the second quarter this year and they were about 5% of revenue in the second quarter last year, maybe a little less. So that's helpful, but that's not what's absolutely required for us to continue to grow. It was another just terrific quarter and we're positioned of course for a record year.  And with that, I think we can open up to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Investment Research.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: Brian, I'm wondering if you could give us a little more color on the tag and traffic opportunities that you're referring to in the second quarter. Obviously, there's some municipal secrecy around it. We understand that, but if there's some additional color you could give us there, would be helpful.
B. Jellison: No, we just -- we continue to migrate people to smaller and easier to apply sticker tags and those tend to replace the hard case tag technologies at a relatively fast pace. So this is more growth in our core markets: Texas, Oklahoma, Florida. We have the benefit of North Carolina rolling out in second half of the year. And then we'll have some international development in the Middle East that will improve shipments. So all those things help. So I think one thing that has really been sort of encouraging, it's counterintuitive to how we would think about municipal spending is that we've got a number of design projects that we're doing, some in the Far West, an important one that we just won around Pennsylvania on a conversion project. So our traffic business is actually doing pretty well. And I think we probably commented in here relative to -- we would have expected it to be a headwind. And it's been certainly neutral to modest upside for us.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: Great. And just for John. John, you gave us the organic for RF. Could you give us just kind of high-level kind of the organic level? The organic sales reach of the other segments?
John Humphrey: Sure. Yes, I can do that. The organic growth by segment for industrial technology was 23%. For the medical and imaging, it was 12%. For RF Technology, it was 13% and for our energy systems and controls it's 18%.
Operator: We'll hear next from Deane Dray of Citi.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: I want to follow up in the RF segment with a couple questions, the first on CBORD. It was interesting that you're recognizing higher sales for the college and universities. It was my sense that maybe it's the timing of when you actually do the installations during the summer months. So maybe it's a revenue recognition on these orders, but is the understanding that you're doing most of the deployments during the summer months?
John Humphrey: Deane, it is true that we do most of the deployments during the summer months. However, because of the software recognition rules that we have and the fact that we really sell the software on a 1-year license basis, we actually defer that revenue over a 12-month period. So there's a little bit of benefit during the installation phase associated with the products. But by and large, CBORD is a software business. It accounts for well over 2/3 of their revenue is software and naturally spread ratably over the year. So the growth that we're seeing there is not because of installations. It's because of new wins and the continued deployment of software into other areas like security application in a campus environment.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: Great, that's helpful. And then On CBORD, one of the comps was Blackboard and I was hoping Brian could comment on the sale into private equity of Blackboard. I mean, obviously, there's a validation of the value of CBORD, but are there any other implications?
John Humphrey: Well, I think it validates that not everybody has picked up on how valuable all of our software-as-a-service solution businesses are. I mean, these businesses in public markets routinely trade at 20x to 25x enterprise by EBITDA. And the last time I looked, we weren't quite there yet in our multiple. So we just encourage people to realize how important these businesses are and how valuable they are. Eventually, I think maybe somebody will catch up to us on that. So we see a lot of upside for recognition on what we're doing and how we're doing it.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: And then just a last one for me on iTrade. Hopefully, you could comment on or expand your comments. Two things you said interesting. One is that you wanted to see them keep to their core business and then also maybe clarify what you meant about being more nimble in Europe?
B. Jellison: Well, we won this major project in Europe. We -- I don't know if we're ever going to be able to say who it is until somebody figures that out. It's getting business -- it's like dealing with some of our favorite customers here in the U.S. who never want us to say anything. But it's a big deal and we have to improve our infrastructure there to do that. I think that we're learning that trying to do that out of our U.S. locations is a little bit difficult. So getting global reach and the integration around the global reach is we're moving at a very fast pace and adding executive talent to help us in Europe in that respect. And we felt as we've been going through the business that some of the projects that people were looking at were a little less exciting, we felt, than getting the global growth out of the core business. So we've encouraged them to worry a little less about certain types of things and invest more in the things that they can really control and I think that, that'll produce really good results for us in 2012.
Operator: We'll hear next from Alex Blanton of Clear Harbor Asset Management.
Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC: Brian, listen, what are you going to do when the economy recovers? I mean...
B. Jellison: Well, we're a little excited about that ourselves. But the economy, to be fair, I mean the industrial business, that portion of the economy has recovered, and the energy business is certainly recovering even though it should be better in the second half.
Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC: Yes. You referred to the BRICS and 5% of sales being there. And yet there is -- for a lot of the products that you have, it seems to me there's tremendous opportunity there. I suggest that you don't have time to address those opportunities and because you're growing so rapidly elsewhere, because other companies are in the position of having to go to the BRICS in order to get any growth at all some of them. So you don't have that problem.
B. Jellison: I think that's the difference between having products that are really mature products and looking for geographic expansion with those mature products versus ourselves, which are primarily solution providers with a lot of application engineering and very few standard products. And so in order for us to -- let's take India, for instance, where our bid activity and channel development is expanding most rapidly. Again, our markets are pretty small, right? So it's pretty hard to make a major investment in India that might drive $10 million in growth for 3 of the pump companies. It's just not pragmatic and the things that we do are so application-specific that you probably got to have to rely on local distribution for what happens, and we're probably the most conservative people you'll meet on how we look at distribution channels and assuring that we're very comfortable with all the activity that create revenue in these countries.
Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC: Yes, I can see that. Are there any opportunities at all in China for you, do you think?
B. Jellison: Oh, absolutely. China's growing rather dramatically. And maybe John, you want to comment on the growth in China?
John Humphrey: Sure. In effect, China represents one of the BRIC countries. Obviously, China is the largest for us and we have a variety of things that we're doing there, both selling sort of our industrial products, whether it be our sensors and instruments for the plastic and latex businesses or our marine applications out of AMOT and valves there. And if they continue to adopt more safety standards, we look at that as a growing opportunity for some of our diesel engine safety systems as well as some of the compressed controllers. So we'll continue to be there. We have people on the ground there. We have direct sales force looking at applications there, but it's a growth area as are many other areas where our technology can be applied. It's not going to be the sole or even major driver for our growth going forward.
Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC: Okay, and one more thing. You mentioned that you have the only lead-free meter in the U.S., water meter.
B. Jellison: Yes.
Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC: How did that -- why aren't your competitors developing that? And also what about the world?
B. Jellison: Oh, we can't speak to the competitors. But I believe that those people who haven't yet figured out a source for a lead-free water meter will be doing so pretty quickly. Check out that shedthelead.com/video/ for 4.5 minutes. It's quite interesting and it's a nontechnical video. It's actually been made for municipal water companies. There's thousands of these in the country and for them to kind of understand the innuendo that's been occurring the last couple of years is a bit difficult. This is a very simple way of trying to get people to say, oh gee, now I get it.
Operator: We'll move next to Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Brian, you mentioned that shale projects in the U.S. driving a lot of at least the pump businesses and industrial tech. Is energy systems also seeing a net benefit from that activity? Has it been a material contributor to your end-market demand?
B. Jellison: Well, it's different in the 2 cases. In the case of Roper pump, it affects growing operations. In the case of Cornell, it's dewatering pumps. When you get to energy, it's more around our what we call a DESS [ph] business, which is -- are these control technologies to assure that the diesel engines shut off. And we continue to work both with OSHA here in the U.S. and various agencies around the world about the importance of these shutoff valves and the recognition continues to grow, and we've got the best mousetrap on this in the world. So that's helping us a lot. So certainly, any place you're going to have oil shale activity, we're going to get benefited in energy and real directly in our fluid handling business.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: I've been looking at industrial tech, continues to impress on the operating margin line. Is 20% what you're thinking is kind of a sustainable level over the next cycle here or is another 100 bps or so available? If you think about you said that you're reducing the raw material content in your water meters, which obviously Neptune's a big portion of that segment, do you still see upside there? Are your recovering your costs from the copper spikes?
B. Jellison: Yes, I'd say that we've done a great job in managing through the cost increases in copper. I mean, I can remember when it used to be $0.74 a pound or something, and here it is at $4.39. And now, there's almost 2 pounds of copper in every meter, so it's a big deal when you got a product that maybe sells for $20 or something. So we would give them great credit for how they're performing. Now we continue to make a commitment that we're going to have lead-free water meters that are bronze-based technologies as opposed to some people who are looking at going to plastic, which we think is a long way from being a safe installation project for people. In the pump businesses, we generally have enough pricing power that if we've got cost-push inflation on materials side that we can pass that through and not mark it up, it's almost just a separate side matter of things. So it hasn't really hurt us in any event. I think we continue to get leverage as revenue goes up, so on the OP line you could see we got 34% leverage in the quarter. And in both industrial and energy, we don't have very much noncash amortization that's coming off of those. So that kind of 30%, 35% leverage, I think, continues with us. That ought to be a perpetual opportunity as long as revenue is expanding.
Operator: We'll hear next from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: I had a question on CBORD. Wondering if you could update what you see as the public school opportunity and some rollout there or if that adoption really doesn't seem to be a current story?
B. Jellison: Well, we think about 2 different things maybe. I'm not sure we understand your question. CBORD is primarily focused on college and university environments, so it wouldn't matter whether that was a state school or a private institution. Horizon is focused on elementary education and K through 12, and there, most of that business is public business. It's really driven by nutrition management and by sorting out how much the free lunch program is going to be paid for individual people and the proof of that. And so Horizon has very large public institution contracts like Dallas, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, things like that and bids large contracts in that arena and then also does somewhat smaller domain places as well.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Okay, thanks for the clarification. And just the second half tax rate built into the guidance?
John Humphrey: Second half tax rate, we're expecting to be in the range of 30%, bringing the full year to also in the range of 30%. So kind of through the first half we're at 30.4%. And then just timing related, we probably expect Q3 to be a little bit better than that, and Q4 we'll have to see.
Operator: We'll move next to Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Hey, Brian, wonder if you'd talk about the M&A landscape from the perspective of the different platforms where you see maybe more activity relatively speaking? And then maybe you can remind us where this Software-as-a-Service, as a percentage of the total company, is today and where you see that going over the next 3 to 5 years?
B. Jellison: Well, let's say from a software -- we continue to see a lot of opportunities in what we call network technologies. And it's a very ironic thing about -- as we look at all of our businesses on a niche basis and we want to keep focused on a P&L basis and customer profitability basis, I think we do a great job in that arena. And as a result of their kind of customer intimacy, they don't lend themselves to forced synergies from a physical asset basis. So in our pump, we've got a great centrifugal pump company, we got a great piston pump company. You can't put those factories together, they fundamentally do different kind of things. In the network arena, that's actually not true. I mean it's very ironic, but in fact they're doing a lot of data storage, they've got a lot of things that are really quite similar in the back end of an enterprise that you can nimbly get a lot of synergies around. So it's absolutely positive to get cost synergies out of software network businesses that we can't get out of the industrial and energy businesses. So that makes them pretty attractive. And as long as these small network opportunities are available, we think it's an attractive place to invest. Now we're not trying to turn Roper into a single-use software network application company, so we believe our focus around that has been opportunistic. They generate more cash than the other businesses do and they require less assets and they virtually never have anything that depreciates, and their assets go home at night. And as long as you motivate them, you get a wonderful cash-on-cash return over a long period of time. Today, John, I don't know if you've provided much guidance around overall revenue, but that it's getting to be certainly a very significant portion of the RF business. At some point, we're going to split this out for you so that you'll see the tolling business completely separate from all the rest of the RF business. That's something I expect we would probably do for 2012, so that it's easier for everybody to see the variance in the 2 because you do have this terribly lumpy TransCore order input situation that's up terrifically in Q1 and down a little bit in Q2, but over the first half of the year it's double-digit growth. But it certainly makes it confusing. So we just have to do a few things to get that in place to be able to respond to your question clearly, which we'll do for next year.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And on the M&A landscape?
B. Jellison: Well, the M&A landscape, we think people that are doing public company deals continue to generally overpay for them. We've had a lot of stuff in the pipeline. I think that it's not necessarily that we're focused on the medical product arena and the network software arena, but that's what we're seeing more of than other assets. We haven't seen energy assets other than very small bolt-on type things that we think have been priced at a level that we'd be comfortable with. And the industrial asset arena, we continue to grow internally for the most part as opposed to looking at asset acquisitions. So I think that the next acquisitions you'll see from us are likely to be in network technology or additional medical build-out.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And then in terms of the second half guidance on just the organic side, it sounds like you're seeing or expecting a pretty similar rate, 3Q versus 4Q, but I want to make sure I cleanly translated some comments on a couple of segments in that context.
B. Jellison: We'll have better, but we would expect to have better growth in Q3 on a revenue basis than we would in Q4, and our guidance really would indicate that. So if markets were as good as they've been recently and trends continue, then maybe there'd be some upside in Q4. But our view is Q3 is going to be better than we would have originally expected. Q2 was better than we certainly expected. So both Q3 and 4 are very difficult comps. We had just a blowout in the fourth quarter last year it's going to be tough to do substantially better than that. But we've had other tough challenges, too.
Operator: We'll move next to Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: John, could you just provide maybe a little bit more guidance on the Northern Digital kind of business metrics. I mean, what kind of revenue run rate do we expect there, for instance? And also just maybe a growth rate here over the next couple of years?
John Humphrey: Sure. I mean what we've said about that is that revenue should be in the $50 million to $60 million range for the next 12 months. It's been growing substantially as more image-guided surgery utilizes the equipment and the consumables that they have and so we expect their double-digit growth rate to continue at least for the next few years and we'll have to look at it beyond that. But all of the trends with their technology and the trends in the marketplace around having less invasive, more image-guided surgery are favorable for them.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: And is this kind of a GAAP EBIT contributor in terms of double digit, in terms of over 20% plus, in terms of kind of GAAP to EBIT as it drops in contribution margin?
John Humphrey: It will be in that range, yes.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay, all right. And then also Brian, how do you feel about iTrade's revenue run rate here? I know you talked a little bit to the opportunities and the bidding opportunities, especially international. How do you feel about their iTrade's revenue run rate as it stood for the first 6 months of the year?
B. Jellison: It's been lower than what we would've liked to have seen. But on the other hand, there were a couple things that they were doing in data analytics that are interesting to do. But they've got an absolutely great core program and we'd like to see that core program grow and expand rapidly, and so I think they probably could have grown a little better than they have, so we've been refocusing on what we consider to be the most important customer opportunities. They're probably running a few million under what we would have expected that they would do, but it's still a fantastic group of people and a wonderful business and it's already created a lot of shareholder value, and it will create more in the future.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Is their core revenue -- is the volatility maybe there or what they can deliver on a quarterly basis? Is that more a function of their customer base and the volumes to their customer base? I mean the way I understand that business model, it's not a function of how many new accounts you're signing up, rather what's the underlying business activity? Is that how to think about their revenue on a quarterly run rate?
John Humphrey: No, it's not actually around how much activity is running through their network. It's really around how many people are subscribed. So think of it as a subscription-type business and the more that their customers will deploy this to their suppliers. So it's really around how quickly the customers are able to bring their suppliers onto the network, which is not a huge technical challenge. It's really a business process challenge for the customer, not really for iTrade. So our growth is, a, dependent on getting new customers which we continue to do, and then how quickly those customers roll this solution out to their supply base.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay, and then just a last question. When I looked at the orders number, the $707.6 million, what was the core growth rate in orders versus the $14.3 million?
John Humphrey: From an organic standpoint, it was about 8% up and the book-to-bill ratio was just over -- under 1%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: A couple of questions I want to talk about the RF Tech business for a minute. The operating margins performance you had in Q2 was probably the best you've had in the last 10 or 12 quarters. I now it's a mix-sensitive business. So can you talk a little bit about the mix dynamics that you encountered in Q2 and kind of what the project activities that's on the board for the back half of the year? How should we think about RF Tech margins proceeding from here?
B. Jellison: Well, the worst margins are always going to be in the transport traffic segment, which is heavy administrative activity, violation processing and lane expansion and moving traffic lights and those type of things. Whenever we have growth in the other portions of the activity at much faster rate than those business grow, then we get a whole lot better contribution because, I mean, you're looking at an order of magnitude several times the difference there. So the other thing that's happening, of course, is we get more embedded growth out of the software businesses at the expense of the TransCore tolling and traffic business, and so as you get that, you get a higher margin capture and better cash. And lastly, when the tag shipments occur, then that tends to be better than the administrative margin activity does. So the administrative activity hasn't grown. In fact, it was down a little bit, I believe, in the second quarter year-over-year and so that's bad news on revenue, good news on margins.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: And then just in the medical life sciences-related area, specifically with Verathon, you talk about kind of the new product pipeline for 2012 and moving forward with Heartscape. And now that you're kind of few quarters into that process, have you thought about it or can you give us some sort of parameter around what you think these next-generation products out of Verathon can add incrementally to revenue next year?
B. Jellison: I think you probably got to wait for another quarter or 2. I mean we're finished with the -- the trials are completed and done and accepted on Heartscape, but it takes a while to get that into the marketplace. The reaction has been very favorable to people as we explain it to them and demo it at hospitals. But we're not going to provide guidance on that for another probably 2 quarters.
Operator: We'll move next to Wendy Caplan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
Wendy Caplan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: If we look at CBORD and Horizon and Neptune and TransCore and iTrade, have there been any meaningful market share shifts in any of those businesses as far as you can tell at this point?
B. Jellison: Well, each one will be a bit different, right? I mean Neptune clearly has been up double digits in the first half of the year. Some of the other public companies, they either have debt or publicly traded have reported degradation in numbers. So whether that's project related or us gaining share is always hard to answer, but we've certainly been outperforming people this year, so I'd say they're gaining share. But I think, for us, what we're encouraged by is we ought to gain more share in the future because I think we've got a clearly superior lead-free technology to people. On the Technolog front, I mean that's something that certainly gains share, but it's like a turnkey thing and then you fill it out right, so it's doing fine. On CBORD, it's certainly -- I believe most people would agree that it has gained share at the expense of people with universities that it's taken over that used to be covered by different folks. So it's definitely gaining share. I think it's so focused rather than being somebody that's in a diverse area. I think we're really proud of the team we have and the customer intimacy they have and the follow-up they have with customers and their ability to get things integrated online. So I think they'll continue to gain share. And I'd say the same with Horizon. The Horizon activity is very better than we would have hoped for given the difficulty with educational spending. I think if you ever got any relief around funding in the K through 12 arena, which you may or may not get, if you get it, it's probably because of nutrition. We see a lot of build-out opportunities where we can do things beside the meal platform of what happens in K through 12 education around data gathering, and we have a number of new software developments that we're putting in place around how a school can manage its kind of inflow of cash from families. Our MealpayPlus program, it's a homerun, but it can get applied to a lot of new avenues, and they're working hard on that now.
Wendy Caplan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And finally an update on Freight Matching?
B. Jellison: Freight Matching continues to be a spectacular business. It's doing well. It's got growth this year. It's certainly having all of its normalized renewals that continue, so not a massive revenue number but a fantastic cash-on-cash growth number and we're very glad to own it.
Operator: That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Jennifer. And thank you, all, for joining us this morning. We looking forward to talking to you again in October.
Operator: And again that does conclude our conference. Thank you, all, for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Roper Quarter and Year Financial Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Melody, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the record results for our first quarter 2011. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. In addition, we've prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com. Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now if you'll please turn to Slide 3. I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we'll take questions from our participants. Brian?
B. Jellison: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We'll take you first through the Q1 financial results in detail, and then we'll look at the segment performance and the outlook for Q2 and the rest of the year. I'll talk about raising our guidance and then sort of summarize the quarter and take your questions. First slide here is the financial results. You can see we achieved a record, all-time record for Q1, in orders and sales backlog, net earnings, EBITDA and pretty much every other measurement you can imagine. The thing that was particularly gratifying was our book-to-bill ratio was 109%. Generally, we're at the sort of 97% to 103%, so to be at 109% is very encouraging for the remainder of the year.  Organic growth was really quite spectacular, we thought, with 20% order growth. And all 4 of the segments had double-digit order growth and revenue growth, which you can see organically was 16%. Gross margins increased to 54.3%, so any fear of input costs creating any difficulty at Roper was not well founded. EBITDA margins are up 310 basis points to 27.4%. Remember with us that's mostly EBITA. There's not much depreciation here.  Our balance sheet was enhanced as we continued to pay down our revolver, and we ended the quarter with an all-time record backlog of $851 million in revenue, which is 43% higher than the backlog at the end of the first quarter of last year, up $257 million. Now we certainly, when we established our guidance for Q1, thought we would have a strong start, but this is even better than our best expectations. Next slide. Our income statement. Here you could see the bookings at $702 million, up 24% in total and 20% organically. Net sales of $645 million, up 21% in total and 16% organically. Our gross profit went from 52.3% the first quarter of last year to 54.3% here, an increase of 200 basis points.  Our operating income was up 41%, that went from 18.8% last year to 22% this year, so that's really quite outstanding leverage. In fact, we'll talk a little bit more about our leverage on the variable contribution here for the revenue. Our interest expense was basically flat. The tax rate was also quite similar to the prior year and that produced net earnings, up 49% to $89 million from $59.7 million last year and a diluted earnings per share number of $0.91 versus the $0.62 GAAP number from the prior year. On the next slide. On the asset velocity, while the absolute amount -- the dollar amount of inventory receivable was up a little bit, as a function of the revenue it continues to decline. You'll see in the first quarter our inventory was 7.7% of revenue, down from 8.2%. In the prior year, our receivables were down to 16%, a pickup of 50 basis points from the 16.5% the prior year. And our payables and accruals or liabilities there actually increased to 16.1% from 15.8%. So when we total it, at the end of last year, we were 8.9% of sales, and this year it's down 130 basis points to 7.6% of revenues. So year-over-year, we see continued improvement in our asset velocity. Next slide. We ended the quarter with a really strong balance sheet. Cash was $261 million. We paid down the revolver, so there's quite a bit of the revolver left. When you take the revolver and the cash together, we wind up with $813 million of available liquidity. And of course, we'll have very strong cash in Q2 and throughout the rest of the year.  Our net debt is down to $980 million, and you can see that gives us a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio on a trailing basis of only 1.4x, and our EBITDA will continue to expand rapidly throughout the year on a trailing basis. Our EBITDA-to-interest coverage is already at 10.2x. So these ratios are extremely strong and they really enhance our liquidity and our ability to use the balance sheet in the quarters ahead. Next slide. Here we're going to look at the individual segment performance and the outlook.  Next slide. Order strength, as you can see, was really spectacular. Industrial Technology was up 30%, RF Technology was up 30%, Energy Systems & Controls 16% and Medical & Scientific up 15%. The book-to-bill ratios were very strong all the way across, anywhere from 118% in Industrial down to 103% in Medical & Imaging. We had double-digit organic growth in all 4 segments for revenue as well. Next slide. If you look at RF Technology, you can see that orders reached $217 million in the quarter, up 30% from the prior year and 18% organically. Our sales were $200 million, which was up 23% year-over-year and up more than 10% organically. Our gross margin expanded to 51.4%, which was up 170 basis points, and our operating margin was up 270 basis points. We finished the quarter with an EBITDA margin of 30.7%, which was up 450 basis points from the first quarter of 2010. So you see very strong EBITDA performance with our iTrade business contributing a substantial amount of noncash amortization to the EBITDA measure here. In the first quarter of 2011, we had very strong tag sales for both Florida, Oklahoma and Dubai. In fact our Amtech business was up over 40%. A significant growth in our Gas Automated Meter Reading business with the Gaz de France project and quite substantial increase in the U.K., our Water Network Metering and Monitoring business as those were up well in excess of 40% as well. And in CBORD, we had an expanded subscriber base. We won in another major university in Miami, a university in Ohio, a big security win there, displacing a longtime occupant in that role. In Q2, what we'd see is that the Gaz de France AMR project ought to continue at similar levels to Q1. We'll have a very strong seasonal Q2 because CBORD winds up with their annual renewals following into the second quarter, so we should see double-digit growth there.  Our Houston METRO project appears to be on schedule, and we ought to see what we have in our forecast for the second quarter. And iTrade has won a very, very significant opportunity to launch a system for a major European food retailer that we can't yet announce, but the launch is underway and the integration will begin within the year. It's very encouraging for us to see the direction at RF Technology because last year in 2010's first quarter, our organic revenue was down 12%, the second quarter it was down 7%, third quarter it was down 1%, the fourth quarter it was up 6%. So we're out of the gate here with more than a 10% organic gain here in the first quarter, and we expect the balance of the year is going to give us double-digit growth throughout the next 3 quarters. Q2 a little lighter, Q3 much stronger and Q4 similar to this quarter. Next slide. In Industrial Technology, just absolutely spectacular performance here. Our orders were up 30% to $201 million. Of course, that's all organic. Our sales were up 26%, aided by about 60 basis points of FX, so you could round organic down to 25%. Gross margins were at 50.4%, so they've continued to expand, and their operating margin was up 370 basis points to 27.2%. EBITDA in Industrial Technology finished the quarter at 30.6%.  Virtually, everyone there had a very strong quarter. Our Fluid Handling businesses that deal with gas and exploration with the new products we've launched in the last year and half just are having extraordinary performance. These businesses are nearly up 50%. The Material Testing business we have as we can to get better capacity utilization around the country is growing very rapidly.  And we actually had double-digit growth in our U.S. business in Neptune and then still more growth as a result of Canada continuing to ship in the Mexico City order we announced in the fourth quarter. So Neptune had a very strong Q1, and we expect that to continue. In Q2, the backlog at our Fluid Handling businesses that are offering Cornell Pump will assure double-digit growth in the second quarter. The Toronto project installation phase is going to actually ramp up in Q2, although because there's a lot of labor in that it comes in at the expected lower margins that we have there.  End markets remain very strong in all these Industrial categories, and the operating leverage that we get is continuing to drive margin performance. You can really see just how effective we are when you look at the spot price for copper. In the first quarter last year, it was $3.55. Spot price this year is $4.30 and yet our margins expanded across the board whether they're gross margins, operating margins or EBITDA margins. Next slide. The Energy Systems & Control segment. It continues to perform well. Here, orders were up 16%, all organic. Sales up 23%. Gross margin expanded quite a bit from up 350 basis points to 54.1%. And the operating profit margin increased 450 basis point. You might remember we were somewhat disappointed in Q1 2010 with the operating margin. Got that corrected in the second quarter, and this shows the kind of firm, disciplined approach to what we needed to do after that first quarter of last year. And that certainly supports this 450 basis point improvement in OP. EBITDA margins here were about 26%.  Again you can say exactly the same thing, the same words that apply to Industrial Technology: broad-based strength across all businesses and end markets. Everything here is really doing exceptionally well. Very dramatic growth in our Diesel Engine Surge Protection business. We almost called it explosive growth, but thought that might scare people. That business is up nearly 40% this year. Industrial end market growth continues to drive our Sensors business as capacity utilization back in the latex and rubber industry looks very good and then equipment sales to measure the output of those things were up sharply. And all of our Energy Lab Equipment businesses are doing okay as we've finally got a little bit improvement in both refining and petrochem markets. In the second quarter, the end market dynamics we think will continue to be strong. Our backlog is really quite substantial in our Compressor Control business, which will start to drive better Vs here in Q2 and particularly in the second half of the year. And the margin expansion we think will continue to be driven just by the operating leverage as sales increase throughout the year. Next slide. Here's the Medical & Imaging segment. Orders were up 15%. Tiny bit of FX there, so organic it was 14%. Sales were up 12%. The gross margins here, 62.8%, up 330 basis points. And our OP was up to 24.1%. EBITDA in this segment is 29.1%, so EBITDA margins increased by 110 basis points.  We've done quite a bit of investing in the first quarter in our Verathon business. We're launching 2 new products, 1 is called Velaport [ph] and that has had us incur some growth expense in Q1 and that will continue a little bit into Q2 as we launch all that collateral literature and the various programs and held a sales meeting in Q1 to kick that product off along with some other things we're doing as well.  Medical remains strong on consumables, double-digit growth in all these businesses in our kidney dialysis application for our Dosage Delivery Pump business continued to be a double-digit grower. Very significant order growth in our high-end imaging cameras and filtering technology. It was the growth star of the quarter as we looked at the filters for electron microscopy being up very dramatically. In the second quarter of 2011, we see Medical continuing to grow at double digits as we get continuing adoption rates for GlideScope and Velaport [ph]. No new products have been launched within this year. And the Scientific Imaging has a really quite substantial backlog that will support a strong Q2.  The Japanese supply risks have proven to be less difficult than what we feared on certain high-end chips that are made very specifically for us. We've kind of dealt with all those issues and feel quite good about it. The only thing for Japan is that a substantial portion of our Camera business goes into the Japanese market. It represents a disproportionate share compared to the rest of Roper.  Our total sales into Japan are in the neighborhood of 3% of revenues, so it's not something that's overly difficult for us that could depress revenue growth for the camera portion of the business in the next quarter or 2. But then that will just fill the backlog. It will be good news for us later. Next slide. Here, as we look at the guidance, we're going to raise the guidance.  Next slide. We were at $3.82 to $4.02 when we went into the year. We've raised the base by $0.15 and the top end by $0.10 to take us to $3.97 to $4.12. The midpoint of that is more than a 20% increase over last year's $3.34 on a GAAP basis. And in the second quarter, we're at $0.95 to $1.00, which is quite a sharp increase over last year's Q2 performance.  Basically, the sales we expect to have, kind of mid-teens organic growth in the second quarter and the second half of the year. Probably in the kind of high single digit, 8% to 10% or 11%, so the full year will be double-digit organic growth.  I guess the next slide would be the -- well, we're still reaffirming that cash flow would be in excess of $550 million, so that -- you can imagine the next 3 quarters will be quite substantial in terms of operating cash flow will generate. In quarter 1 summary, the next slide. All-time record there in Q1 for order sales backlog, net earnings and EBITDA. Gross margin demonstrated that we didn't have any difficulty with input costs at 54.3%. Operating margin is up 320 basis points to 22%. That's leverage of 37%, by the way, on the OP line. And our EBITDA margin is up 310 basis points to 27.4%. It gives us a leverage of 43%. At 43% leverage, of course, benefits from iTrade with its amortization.  Organic growth was 20% on orders and 16% on sales. The $851 million backlog -- boy, I can remember when our total sales for the year were $500 million. So being up 43% over the prior year gives us a flood of optimism for the rest.  Most importantly, is everything really performed well. If you look around, you can only find 2 or 3 things, which are quite small in their scope that aren't really doing exceptionally well. So we raised our guidance up to $3.97 to $4.12 and certainly our position for another record year at Roper.  And with that, let's open it up to questions, John.
John Humphrey: Okay, Melody, we're ready for the Q&A part of the call.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: Just a couple of questions. Brian, the tone of your press release sounds a little bit more optimistic on kind of the availability of deals or maybe reasonable properties at reasonable prices. Could you elaborate on that a little bit, and kind of talk about the pipeline?
B. Jellison: Well, I would say that there are a lot of opportunities. There are fewer that are reasonable. But there are quite a lot that are relatively reasonable. So we're pretty encouraged by the transactions we have and the people we're talking with on this. In the same venue, somebody called me last night from Europe about a transaction that people think we should be interested in, which we never would be, but bragging that they were going to get a debt staple of 6 3/4 on this transaction. So I mean the frothiness and lack of discipline around debt being applied to sales processes is pretty much back to the status it's ever been. So you do want to be careful about what it is you're doing. But we have more than enough really outstanding opportunity to execute over the next 12 months. So we're very encouraged. I would say that the things that we're doing, we like as much as the transactions we've done recently with United Toll and with iTrade and with Verathon, so I think there's exciting days ahead.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: And to go to iTrade, if you wouldn't mind, you said you couldn't elaborate too much on this possible European project, or it sounds like it's not possible. It sounds like you've booked it. Could you just speak a little bit to -- is the scope of that job different than what they've done before? Really, the essence of my question is as you've brought iTrade into the portfolio, are you finding ways to coordinate with some of the capabilities elsewhere in RF? And even if it doesn't apply to this particular deal, maybe you could give us a little color on that.
B. Jellison: Well, those are kind of 2 totally different things. So let's first, just on this European thing. We just aren't at liberty to name a name, but it would have such a compelling name that you're thinking of it domestically. It'll be like saying well I got Kroger or I got Wal-Mart or something like that. It's a very, very large significant pan-European opportunity. And it will take us a couple of years to do everything we're going to be able to do with them and a lot to build that opportunity and then later analytic opportunity with that. So we're really excited about that. It's 1 of the things we were really hoping we'd able to bring into the wheelhouse. And we have -- we're making some growth investments in that because we have to increase our server space. We have to have specific things in Europe for these people to access. In terms of other opportunities within Roper, we have opportunities both in freight matching and in CBORD around menu planning and nutrition information, which we continue to work on. We've had some -- they're not cross-selling, they're technology-sharing opportunities for applications. And we've had important household names in the food industry. And just recently in Miami, Florida extensive program, and we're going to continue to do that throughout the year. So yes, I think we will see some -- I think most of the sales will accrete to iTrade, but some may accrete to other things within the "software as a service" platform we're building within RF.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: And just 1 other if I could, and I'll pass it on. Neptune did sound like it was very strong and you cited U.S. Is that some fresh penetration in places, or is that business becoming mature enough now that you're seeing some replacement activity? Just a little color there, please.
B. Jellison: Well, it was up about 20% in the U.S., so we thought we would just kind of comment on that because other people were wondering about people gaining share at our expense. It never happened. Isn't going to happen. And all you got to do is look at the other people in Q1 and look at us. So this is the best premier business in the world than what it does. I would say the markets are fairly mature, certainly held back dramatically by the lack of housing starts. My goodness, if we had any housing starts, you'd think how much more organic growth we would get back in that business. It's just well positioned with the right sort of hybrid ability to deal with fixed network, so we're mobile in any form of integration and migration. There's another thing that's emerging that people haven't paid enough attention to and that is that we have the only U.S. lead-free water meter. Period. End of discussion. If anybody ever reinforces buy American or says I want lead-free water meters, which is a mandated requirement in the coming years, we're the sole sourceability to do that. Somebody is making lead-free and lead in the same factory in Mexico, I hardly think it would qualify as buying American lead-free-only water meter. So we're very proud of Neptune. It's a wonderful management team. They're very dedicated. They're working a lot on forward technologies. And you know, we may make further investments in that space to help them.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: Thank you very much, guys.
Operator: We'll hear next from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Thanks. Brian, just wondering on the Imaging trends. The Verathon seemed to be in a pretty strong ramp throughout last year. Just wondering if those initial product lines are more approaching run rate? And if you could add any color on what the commercial opportunity might look like for some of the new product launches there.
B. Jellison: Yes, let me ask John to talk to that. I guess John really focused on Verathon here.
John Humphrey: Sure, yes. I'll go ahead and speak to that. The adoption rates, particularly for GlideScope continues to be very strong, with a lot of product enhancements and other things that we're doing there to make it a more mobile, so more people are able to have access to that in a hospital setting. So continued product refinements or continuing the adoption rate on the GlideScope side. And then on the BladderScan side, continuing to take that core technology of the ultrasound and be able to make that applied in other areas. That's what we've done with AortaScan. That's what we're going to do with Velaport [ph] also in order to make it easier to basically have an IV needle inserted into someone's arm when the vein may be very difficult to find or difficult to see. So taking that same basic technology and making new products and new applications out of it is 1 of the things that Gerald and the team are just fabulous at being able to do out there at Verathon. And we continue to see lots of opportunities for that going forward. And in addition, don't forget we did acquire a product line called Heartscape about this time last year, and we expect that to have some product introductions into the marketplace late in 2011, and that'll also add to growth in 2012. So we're excited about what we see, and the investments that we're making in Verathon will pay off.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Thanks, it's really helpful. And then in the RF mix of the businesses, just looking if RF -- the tolling orders are really kind of a dam breaking, maybe a lot of pent-up demand and projects coming through. We have a mix impact on operating margins this year and also the double-digits growth guidance, was that organic?
B. Jellison: Oh, yes, yes, yes. All of that guides we're talking about was organic. The situation in Q1, we had a good mix because we had tag shipments to Dubai and Florida and Oklahoma and that'll continue somewhat in the second quarter. But unfortunately, the tag shipments are always lumpy. We can't do much about those. And so within the next 3 quarters, there'll be different results based on the mix of just the normal service work we do and product shipments. Since there's a huge variance there both from a gross margin basis and a cash contribution.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Thanks a lot.
Operator: We'll go next to Deane Dray with Citi.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: Thank you. Brian, I'd be interested in hearing your comments about some of the competitor actions in your space very recently and love to hear your comments about how that is either an opportunity or a threat or not meaningful. And the 2, I'd like you to comment on, if you could, the first would be the joint venture between 2 of your competitors in the tolling space, Sirit, and the new owner of Mark IV KTC. And the other would be the development at Blackboard, which is in a space with you. I think there's always misperceptions about what the actual overlap is. But if anything, it's a validation that this is an attractive space, considering they put themselves up for sale. But where's the overlap? Where's the adjacencies within Blackboard? Thank you.
B. Jellison: We'll only take the Blackboard. First, the blackboard really has 2 businesses. They have a business, which is like CBORD which we feel we continue to gain share against them in that space. That for them may be viewed more as a legacy business. You'd have to ask them. That's their university business. And then they have their business, which is really education software that's -- had it not be involved with the university in the same traditional teaching setting we're familiar with. We have nothing to do with them in that space. That's the largest portion of their revenue. How profitable it is, is something you'd have to talk to them about. So there's a small group of competitors like CBORD and Blackboard that are driving what's happening from an adoption viewpoint with universities. We've got a, we think, the best offering in the space. So if Blackboard in fact does transact then someone else takes it over, we wouldn't see that as anything other than what you said, which is validating the quality of the space. If you look at the kind of trading mobiles that Blackboard had even before this 35% premium jack-up, you get why sometimes we get frustrated about people thinking about us as a multi-industry company as opposed to a diversified growth company because so many of our assets today in the SaaS platform space are just undervalues [ph] are extraordinary compared to the multi-industry multiples. And we think people should focus on the quality of the assets we hold in that space. And secondary, as far as -- I mean, Sirit was a basically unprofitable or bad trading dollar business in Canada. That was acquired by Federal Signal, so we don't think of it as Sirit now. We think of it as Federal Signal, which is primarily a business selling the different municipal aspects of stuff. Sirit is kind of at the low end of technology, certainly. And then if you go over to Kapsch, which is an Austrian company publicly traded, they bought the Mark IV assets out of that transaction around Mark IV and bankruptcy and all those things that were tangential to that. We haven't seen any resurgence of anything under Federal Signal, and we certainly haven't seen any resurgence of anything other than Mark IV as just continuing the sale of product and the E-ZPass. They don't win anything new. We have been winning business in California with platforms that 1 of those people used to be involved with. It certainly doesn't -- it doesn't hurt us in anyway. We wind up with Canadians and the Austrians and once again we're the only American company. If people focused on the buy American provisions, we'd be getting even more of the business that those businesses used to enjoy. It hasn't happened yet. But we do think people ought to focus on that. We have a wide range of technologies. We can do anything that those competitors can do at the bottom end or the high end, so we're kind of a one-stop shop. I don't see that really changing.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: Great. And just a follow-up for me would be on the E-ZPass. Any new development there in expectations of how long this takes to play out?
B. Jellison: I guess whatever the long side is, Deane, you take back. I mean there are people who claim that a decision would be made in August. We're encouraged to hear that. We're always wondering what kind of decision would that be. But the testing is completed on everything, I believe. And what's happened is that we enjoy is North Carolina completed their testing for all of our products and have started to take deliveries. And in North Carolina, we've got a ubiquitous solution that allows a whole lot of freedom for people using various tags that has never been in the marketplace before. So we know from a technology viewpoint we have a winning formula, and then it's just a matter of what kind of decision ever gets made by these New York and New Jersey people and the rest of the consortium which makes up the interagency group.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We'll hear next from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Brian, can you update on your initiatives to grow internationally, I'm thinking particularly in your Industrial businesses, Industrial Technology and Energy?
B. Jellison: Well, several of our businesses are not in the U.S. and the Industrial platform or Logitech business is based in Scotland and our Insurance business is based in Denmark. The vast majority of their revenue is not in the U.S. and they're growing quite substantially. Our Abel business is a German-based business, and it has showed a record Q1 order make up for that business, which is very different than the domestic U.S. Flow Control businesses we have. And then the Roper Pump business is mostly a domestic business, which is doing exceptionally well now because of directional drilling and our technology, which allows the frac-ing that you hear so much about. And then our Cornell Pump business is primarily a domestic centrifugal pump business. Occasionally we'll shift stuff to the Middle East. But for the most part, it's designed to be a North American business for North American agriculture and municipal water handling. The scale of this business is such that we would not invest a lot of money and sales outside the United States for these businesses other than things that we have just unique niche applications. So the mix of Industrial is not dissimilar outside the U.S. 40%, 50% versus in the U.S.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: But you don't have any -- you don't have any large-scale plans that really take some of the Roper Pump and other things to more international setting?
B. Jellison: No. I think that people in the flows control industries have about 25x more assets than are needed around the globe. There's confident players everywhere. We've just selected markets that we have unique competency in and wouldn't be making dramatic new capital investments to make more pumps for the world.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then on Medical & Imaging, what's the ratio now of the medical to imaging, the sales kind of breakout? And what's possible on the OP margin here, is Verathon -- they expected savings synergies already gained here and baked into the results? Or is there still some more headroom as far as operating margins?
B. Jellison: Well, actually what's happening, we're investing at a pretty fast rate, so in some ways we're compressing the operating margins intentionally for launching these new products that John spoke about earlier at Verathon. And we've been investing quite a bit in Gatan as well. So as those products are launched to become a little more mature, we'll get some margin improvement there plus we just get terrific capture on leverage. It's like we said, for the whole enterprise, our EBITDA leverage is 43%. It'd be safe to say in Verathon's case, it would be higher. So they have high gross margins in those businesses. The mix between Medical -- Medical was about 1/2, maybe a little over 1/2 now of the total segment. And Medical will continue to grow more rapidly at a double-digit rate than the imaging portion of the platforms, which are much more stable, mature research application businesses. They're going to maybe grow at mid-single digits or something, where the others are going to grow into the teens on a regular ongoing basis. So eventually, the Imaging portion of the portfolio will be much less critical.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Alex Blanton with Clear Harbor Asset Management.
Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: Brian, I remember when your sales were only $70 million. That was 1992. And so I'd like to point out that your sales have grown better than 20% a year. This is the 19th year of that kind of growth, which is truly outstanding. But how long do you think you can keep that going with the size of the acquisitions that you're contemplating plus the organic growth? Could you do it another 5 years?
B. Jellison: Well, I guess I think the next 5 years would be harder than the last 5 years have been. So we haven't established any multiple-year guidance for people, but I think history's a pretty good barometer of what people can do if the markets cooperate, if we get some kind of rational thinking around certain activities in the marketplace, our growth prospects are probably better than -- what we say historically, is that we ought to grow kind of 1.5x to 2x global GDP and we've been able to do a little better than that.
Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: Okay. The second question is on the diesel engine surge protection that you mentioned, were up 40%, is that the AMOT business?
B. Jellison: Well, it's in the AMOT business, but we acquired 2 other companies. We acquired a company called Roda Deaco and another company called CHALWYN. CHALWYN's in the U.K. and Roda Deaco was -- basically got all this oil sands activity. Plus, you've got the explosions that people have from frankly, diesel engine surge, controlled as well they could be. We think these products should be mandatory in every diesel engine in the world. It's a slow slog to get everybody to recognize that. But once people do it, they see the efficiency of it. And then if the adoption rates continue to increase as you've had kind of a return to oil sands production activity, it's driven a lot of growth. And the contribution on these is really quite good.
Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: Well, the installation of diesel engines is not growing at that rate, so it must have been the accident in the Gulf that caused people to start...
B. Jellison: No. The accident in Houston at the refinery, that was another wake-up call for people. A lot of folks think that, that was an explosion that was caused for various reasons, but not the least of which is, when you shut off the diesel engine and it continues to run, it'd be a real problem. Several times we have with AMOT, plus road diesel at CHALWYN, gives us a very unique global platform where we have the most -- we believe the best technology in the world for this and can [indiscernible].
Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: So this is really a lot of retrofit going on here?
B. Jellison: Absolutely.
Alexander Blanton - Clear Harbor Asset Management: Okay, thank you.
B. Jellison: Thanks, Alex.
Operator: And next question comes from Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Couple of questions. First, Brian, given the overall size of the Toronto project and the significance of that, can you give us a little more granularity and kind of what that contributed to revenue in '10 and how that ramp looks in '11 and '12? And would you say -- I know it got delayed, but would you say relative to where you expected it to be today, is it sort of back on track in that regard?
B. Jellison: Yes. The Toronto ramp. I'm going to let John handle that because I think -- I'm not sure exactly what he said there, but if we could have you verify it.
John Humphrey: Sure. Yes. Toronto is ramping up as expected. Of course, first quarter installations are always slow as the ground is usually frozen there. And we're still in the kind of the build-out phase of the system that captures and collects and analyzes all the data. So we're really doing a couple of things there, not only the meter installation as well as the network, but also helping on the data management side. And then as we move forward through the year, we'll be ramping up as far as installations are concerned. Now remember, Toronto is the unique situation where we will be overseeing the installation in addition to selling meters. So we'll have a mixed impact, that as we're doing the installation, that actually obviously comes at lower margin than the more technology that's embedded than the meter does. And that, of course, is roughly a $200 million project that will ramp up to -- or it may end up at a kind of a run rate within the $35 million to $40 million range at its peak as we get there in 2012 and '13 and then look to have this project completed and moving into replacement and ongoing data services beyond kind of the 2014, '15 time frame.
B. Jellison: And I think, Matt, that last year in our base data it's less than $10 million, I think we've got $5 million, $6 million, $7 million. And then this year, maybe it'll be 5x that or something like that. So the real expansion is in '13 and '14. This year, we'll get some improvement in revenue less than 1% of our total growth attributed to that in the -- at the enterprise level. Not a lot.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Got it. And then just overall, when you look across your businesses, Brian, are you concerned about municipal spending, municipal budgets or lack thereof? How do you sort of -- how do you reconcile those trends with how you're kind of guiding your businesses right now?
B. Jellison: Well, we are worried about that. We worry about that from a state and municipal spending level. We worry about it from Department of Transportation funding and the like. One of the reasons that we were really pleased with Q1, getting 20% organic growth, was that we didn't see any kind of slowness or holdbacks on the things that we've been working with people. They're -- and we've done a very deep dive in looking at how much of our spending on the water meter side is really related to municipalities versus related to the other facilities that are funded in different ways. We're actually much more optimistic about what's happening in how we distribute and go to market and create revenue. We wouldn't have anything good to say about municipal spending or state spending. But the DOTs and the people that we work with in those arenas are really outside of that list because everything we do in these spaces is revenue generation. It's not -- we don't need a budget or a muni bond to fund the activity that is going to happen with us. So the growth that we've got in Q1 and that we expect throughout the year is certainly ahead of our fears, which is really part of the reason we were willing to raise guidance as much as we did.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: And then lastly, Brian, I think 1 of your last prepared remarks talked about your incremental operating margins being somewhere in the range of 37% in the quarter, which is obviously very good. How do you feel about sustainability of that type of number given some of the mix dynamics that have come out on this call?
B. Jellison: Well, we're always thinking we ought to be able to capture quite a bit. You got gross margins that are above 50%, so we would tend to think that we ought to be in the 25% to 35% range on a regular ongoing basis. And really could do better than that. What's happening right now is that we're -- we've got intangible amortization associated with iTrade, which confuses the world on a -- if you only look at GAAP, you can get really confused, as we all know. iTrade's a phenomenal business. It's given us a lot more so the OP was 37%. Maybe much more importantly, the EBITDA was 43%. So I think this idea that Roper will do 25% to 30% is exceptionally conservative. So we're probably going to do 30% to 35%, and that might even be conservative.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Thanks a lot, Brian.
B. Jellison: Okay.
Operator: We'll go next to Wendy Caplan with SunTrust Capital.
Wendy Caplan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Brian, that $700 million worth of orders in the quarter, was there anything unusual in it in terms of an especially large order or any kind of annualized orders or blanket orders or were they kind of...
B. Jellison: No. I think what was unusual was how broad based it was. I mean with -- you can't find anybody to beat up. It's just spectacular.
Wendy Caplan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And speaking of beating people up, your breakeven lowering mandate for the company, can you kind of talk about whether there's anything specific this year that we should be looking for in terms of particular projects to lower breakeven at various businesses?
B. Jellison: Well, I think all you got to do is just look at the leverage. When you get that 37% OP leverage and 43% on EBITDA leverage, it demonstrates the discipline everybody has about keeping their fixed expense really quite low and reacted creatively to whatever variable output needs they have. We haven't had to do anything to ramp up to meet the increased demand. And with a book-to-bill of 109%, we ought to be able to do pretty well on the revenue in the second quarter and the rest of the year. So when we started the year we thought, gee, we'll probably have pretty good Q1 and Q2 will be okay. It ought to trail off. We don't think that way anymore. So Q1 is really quite good, Q2 should be quite good and the rest of the year ought to be really good, but not trailing off as much as we originally thought.
John Humphrey: And Wendy, if I can just chime in on that. Remember, what we do with the breakeven analysis, it's not that we have a mandate to always lower that, but we always want to make sure that we look at our businesses and that they look at their performance in terms of what their fixed costs and their variable, so they understand what the next dollar of revenue should contribute in terms of leverage. And that when they make investment decisions, that those are conscious, thoughtful, prudent decisions to invest for growth opportunities. So we always want to make sure that we separate out the fixed costs infrastructure from the leverage on incremental growth, so our business leaders are able to make smart decisions about how to grow going forward.
Wendy Caplan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And finally, given your -- just the comments you just made, Brian, and your -- in the slides, it says expected strong start and did even better. Can you give us some sense of what were the 2 or 3 things that really impressed you in the first quarter that changed your view for the full year?
B. Jellison: I would just say the breadth of everything. Every business in Industrial, every business in Energy outperformed really our expectations and their own expectations. And so it isn't that 1 business had a blowout. I mean, certainly, our Cornell and Roper businesses had all-time record performance, which is good. But again, the scale of those is not enough to really drive the enterprise. So it's really just the breadth of things that drove the enterprise.
Wendy Caplan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, thank you so much.
Operator: We'll go next to Robert W. Baird's Richard Eastman.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Yes. 2 quick follow-ups. I mean just on the Industrial Technology side platform, the EBIT margin, did that benefit significantly from mix in that segment? I mean, we talked about maybe Toronto ramping slowly, a little slower here in terms of meter sales. Was there any mix issue there, the Pumps and Materials business being much stronger?
John Humphrey: No. I really wouldn't say that there was a mix benefit. There was clearly no mix downside from the additional installation revenue, that we do expect at some point in the future with Neptune in Toronto ramping up. But the nice thing about these businesses is that they have similar operating characteristics and similar margins. And even on the equipment side versus the aftermarket, obviously the aftermarket parts will be a little bit higher margin, but it's not a dramatic change, it's not like an aerospace business where maybe you don't make anything on the OE and you make it all on the aftermarket. That's not all what we're seeing in Industrial. Our new equipment revenue, we love to see it because it not only generates more spare parts in the future, but it generates more cash today. So really, there's not a huge mix impact there.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: But the pumps and material handlings piece there versus, say, Neptune, I would think the contribution margin there would have been above that total platform level.
John Humphrey: No, I wouldn't say that there's a dramatic difference.
B. Jellison: Not much. Not that dramatic, so you can read into that what you want about other data that gets...
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay. And then Brian, could I -- just real quickly, has there been any uptick in interest and perhaps orders at Zetec given what happened in Japan and kind of the forced global kind of inspection requirements maybe on the nuclear industry or elsewhere outside of Japan?
B. Jellison: Great question, Rick. We haven't included anything in terms of Zetec growth at all in our pathway. We've had lengthy calls on that with people and we're doing a lot. We have volunteered a lot of resources for people to do various testing things, and we also have this robotic testing technology, which is really quite an important technology called, Robospec [ph]. But we could, we would like to believe we would see a spike in the second half on inspections in the U.S., 104 plants. When the thing initially happened and people started talking about it, we felt we might get a 25% spike in half 2, but remember, it's not a real large business. But we're not seeing that scheduled in any way, which is really sort of interesting. So I think everybody has kind of actually stopped the work and is thinking about what it is they need to do and what's the prioritization of that. And our stuff is just measuring the structural integrity of the cooling towers. So it may well be that'll have a bigger impact in 2012 then it'll have in 2011 for us.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay. And then just a last question. When I look at maybe your core growth commentary per quarter going forward, we end calendar '11 at kind of double-digit, maybe, forecast for organic growth. I think we were thinking 10% to 11%. Is there a little bit of an uptick there? And does that come from just the book-to-bill in the first quarter and some visibility into the second?
B. Jellison: You mean for the full year?
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Yes, you kind of said mid-teens for Q2 and maybe 8% to 11% for each of Q3, Q...
B. Jellison: I think we said 9% to 11% organically as I recall. So we'll probably do better than that.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay. All right. And that's again just confidence at this point, given the book-to-bill here off the first quarter and just visibility?
B. Jellison: Yes. And take a lot of -- you don't have to be overly optimistic when you have your $57 million improvement in the backlog.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Understood. Okay, thank you.
B. Jellison: Melody, I think we have time for just 1 more question.
Operator: And we'll take that from Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Thanks. Brian, we're seeing a lot of company's raise earnings guidance for the year, but leave cash flows unchanged as you have done. I'm just wondering what the message in the Roper context is there. Is it just the practical realities of the strong growth at this point of the cycle? Is it the right investment trade-off to be making? Or are you just being a little conservative there?
B. Jellison: Well, I think this point it's probably a little bit early for us to be able to forecast how the incremental growth that we're seeing and probably a little bit stronger than what we had thought, maybe 3 months ago, how that will translate into year-end working capital balances. If you kind of think about the net income impact of, say, raising $0.15 on the bottom for us, that's about $15 million of net income and $15 million of after-tax cash. But like I said, it's a little early to forecast exactly what those year-end balances will be. So we're comfortable still at $550 million or more of operating cash flow. And as we get closer to the end of the year, we'll be able to have a better view on what some of those working capital balances will look like.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And then, Brian, I'm wondering if you could just put a little more color on your earlier M&A comments from the standpoint of size of transactions, whether that might require some or give you an opportunity to do some equity there. And in terms of the platforms where you're seeing the better opportunities, can you provide a little bit of comment there, too?
B. Jellison: Well, I think that we can all -- there's more things to do than we would be willing to do with our capital structure always. I mean we're going to remain an investment-grade performer and so you don't want to really have much more than, say, 3x debt to EBITDA. And if you look at our trailing EBITDA, it's going to ramp up quite dramatically here in the next quarter and third quarter. So we're going to have well in excess of $1 billion capacity with our existing structure without having to issue equity. I can't imagine issuing equity. It would have to just be 1 heck of a breathtaking opportunity for us, and I just don't see that happening. I mean I wouldn't rule it out if you had some kind of nirvana opportunity. But what we -- we continue to just reinvest our cash flow. We think $500 million, $600 million a year is probably where you go when you lever it up at 3x. It could be more. We got a lot of capacity now and responses are exceptionally low. So maybe it goes up, but I wouldn't think we'd be doing some $2 billion transaction. I think we'd do $1 billion one first.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And your platforms where pipelines more robust, Energy, Industrial, Medical, RF across the board, any color there?
B. Jellison: Every Industrial asset in the world are for sale. So we're not overly excited with the stuff we're seeing in that space or the lack of discipline that people have in what they're paying. So we continue to think that the Software-as-a-Service arena and the medical arena remain quite attractive businesses and there's plenty of growth in those businesses in terms of an investment acquisitions, and they really crowd out most of the other investment opportunities in terms of their cash and cash returns over time. So that remains our sharp focus. Maybe there'll be some niche thing along the way that we think is particularly good. But other than that, pretty much we're focused in those 2 areas. And I would just say, Terry, I think we had $87 million of operating cash flow in the quarter. Not unusual for a Q1. So with $550 million for the full year, we're talking about generating $463 million of operating cash flow in the next 3 quarters. And that $463 million operating cash flow, it'll be quite substantial as a function of revenue for the balance of the year. And when you already got $800 million in available liquidity, and you know you're going to create another $400-plus million of free cash flow between now and the end of the year, that gives us all the powder we're going to need to make real high-quality transactions.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. We'll now turn the conference back over to Mr. Humphrey for any additional closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Melody, and thank you all for joining us this morning. And we look forward to talking to you as we finish the second quarter and talk to you again in July. Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Roper Industries Fourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
John Humphrey: Thank you, David, and thank you, all for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of the fourth quarter and full year 2010. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also available on the website at www.roperind.com. So if you turn to Slide 2, we'll begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we'll be making forward-looking statements which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that are described in this page and as detailed in our SEC filings. You should look into today's call in the context of that information. And now if you'll please turn to Slide 3. I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we'll take some questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
B. Jellison: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. We'll start off by just saying the outline for today, we'll talk first about our full year financial results here for 2010 and then go into the enterprise results on a financial basis for the fourth quarter. Then we'll look at the individual segment detail and the outlook for each one of those segments for 2011. I'll talk a little bit about sort of beyond the numbers, things that happened in 2010 that have been learnings for us during the downturn as we come out. And then establish our 2011 guidance and move to Q&A for you. So next slide. For 2010, our enterprise financial results are just fundamentally in every category, an all-time record whether it's orders, sales, backlog, earnings, EBITDA, cash flow, anything one can think of. Our EBITDA margins for the year reached 26.7%, of course, another all-time high. Our operating teams performed exceptionally well, and we enjoyed full year EBITDA leverage on the next dollar of incremental sales of 40%. We had a record asset loss, we will have more to talk about there. And for the first time, we were at $500 million in operating cash flow for the calendar year. Our free cash flow became 20% of sales. We look around it, capital market competitors for us and many of the S&P 500 businesses don't enjoy 20% operating margin, let alone 20% free cash flow to sales. Our free cash flow exceeded net income for the 13th consecutive year. We increased our dividend this year by 16% for 2011 after raising them last year, 15% for 2009. Our book-to-bill ratio for the full year was 1.06. This has created a record backlog of $785 million, which is up $220 million from our year-end backlog last year, and I think one of the things that's amazing for us is that the excellence that we had really permeated throughout the enterprise with only two or three businesses not participating. Next slide. Our full year income statement, you can see here bookings reached about $2.5 billion for the first time. Our bookings were up 25% on the year. Our net sales were up 16%, 8% organic for the year but of course, it continued to move up throughout the year starting out the year with a minus 3% and then a plus 5%, and a plus 14% and closing out at a plus 15%. Our gross margin, again, spectacular 53.4% for the year, up 250 basis points over the prior year. Our income from operations for the year was up 30% at $514 million, and I would remind people that we have about $86 million of noncash intangible amortization that depresses those income margin. So our operating profit margins reached 21.6% for the year. If you add back the noncash intangible amortization, you're over 25%. Our interest expense was up just modestly at $67 million, and the tax rate was slightly down this year at 28.1% versus 29.5% for the prior year. That left us with net earnings of $323 million, up from last year's $239 million, and full year diluted earnings per share of $3.34 versus $2.58 last year. Next slide. Our full year operating cash flow as we said before was $500 million, that was up 36% from last year's $367 million. And our operating cash flow as a percent of sales, you can see it continues to trend up, it was 16% in '07, 19% in '08, dropped by a point to 18% in the Great Recession and it's now back to 21% here in 2010. And our cash conversion on an operating cash flow basis was 155% of net income. Next slide. On a full year free cash flow basis, the $500 million drops to $471 million as we had about $29 million of CapEx. Our free cash flow, as I said, was 20% of revenue, up 300 basis points from last year.  We had stellar execution, which you'll see in our asset velocity numbers in just a minute. And you could see here, you've gone from 122% free cash flow in 2006 to 128%, and then 143%. And I think, in 2008 that was of course a record for us. People expected we'd fall off in the downturn and we didn't. We held the 143%, and now this year as we start back up, we're at 146%. So really, sustained cash flow performance conversion in despite very different economic markets during that five-year period. Next slide. On asset velocity, this is sort of a slide internally here because we focus so much on it that it kind of takes our breath away. You look here at 12/31/10, and our inventory is down to 6.6% of the revenue, receivables at 14.8%, payables and accruals at 16%. So when you add inventory and receivables and subtract the payables and accruals, which is our core measurement, we are at 5.4% of sales. If you go back to '07 and we were at 10% of sales, and those of you who followed us a long time, those numbers used to dramatically higher than that. And when you think about 5.4% to support your revenue and you've got 26.7% EBITDA and 20% free cash flow to sales on a 5.4% number, it truly is outstanding performance and speaks volumes about this asset-like business strategy and execution that we put in place. Next slide. On a balance sheet perspective, we closed the year out with $270 million in cash and $520 million in undrawn revolver, so it's about $800 million of existing capacity. Our net debt to EBITDA is only at 1.7x, and our EBITDA to interest coverage is nearly 10x. We invested $900 million in the last 15 months in transactions. And certainly, we're positioned to capture opportunities at that level in the next 15 days. Next slide. Well here, we look at the specific Q4 enterprise results. Once again, it's an all-time record, truly remarkable quarter for us. Sales were up 23% to $679 million and organic growth represented 15%. Our backlog at $785 million is up 39% from the prior year. Net earnings were up 49% to $107 million. EBITDA at $200 million in the quarter, kind of breath-taking number, up $53 million from a year ago, and EBITDA margins at 29.4%, I just asked people to compare those to gross margins from your S&P 500 diversified companies.  Our free cash flow at 22% of sales and up 31% to $147 million, again just very strong, and by closing out the year, the strongest we have, it really gives us a lot of confidence going into 2011 that we'll have another record year in 2011. Next slide. Our Q4 income statement, you can see here sales and bookings up 23%, both organic at 15%. Book-to-bill closed out at 1.02. Gross profit, 54.7%, up 210 basis points from a year ago. Operating margins at 24.5%. And I'd remind you again about our noncash intangible amortization, about $25 million in the quarter, so another 3.7%. You take the 24.5% and the 3.7%, you get an EBITDA number of 28.2% in the quarter, not bad.  Interest expense, the same in the fourth quarter of '10 as it was last year. Our tax rate dropped to 27.7%. Our guidance was for it to be a little bit above that. We had the benefit of the R&D tax there in the quarter. Net earnings were up 49%, as we said, to $107 million, and earnings per share on a DEPS basis is $1.10 versus $0.77. Next slide. When we get specifically into each of the segments here, we'll talk a little bit about how the fourth quarter was and more importantly, what we think 2011 looks like.  Next slide. So if we look at the margin performance in the segments, you can see RF was at 50% gross margins and Industrial, 52%, Energy, 56%, and Medical and Imaging 63%. Just virtually, the same EBITDA performance along the way 31%, 32%, 31%, 32%, which excludes the corporate cost that brings us down to our enterprise number.  We had really exceptional margins throughout the enterprise with really no segment lagging very much. Of course, the RF is made up of two entirely different kind of entities now, with a little less than of half of it being tolling and transportation and administrative activities, which of course carry much lower margins. And then the majority of the business in our Software-as-a-Service and other RF products basis which enjoy the higher margins. Next slide. In the RF Technology segment, you can see orders were up 4%, sales up 17%, organic sales were up 6%, finally returning to organic growth in the Radio Frequency. Our CBORD and Horizon software businesses had excellent results with campus security, which is picked back up as people are introducing new systems and integrating them with locks and other technologies on campus. And then the healthcare applications were a little better than we expected given the hospital weakness.  We got the benefit of the first full quarter of iTradeNetwork in the numbers, and then in a bit of a surprise, we actually shipped the first phase of the Houston METRO Toll project, which actually we’ve switched over now to our United Toll Service system technology, which quite valuable for not only the city but for us as well. That was something that we would have expected much earlier in the year having not had it come in earlier the year, we thought it would be a 2011 item. A little bit of that has moved into 2010. For full year 2011, we expect that the software businesses will grow through expanding subscription basis, new applications that are going to be offered to existing clients and then a roll out of recent wins which is going to benefit us throughout the year and certainly more so in the second half of '11. Our tolling projects in 2011 as we ship much more of the Houston project will add growth but it does come in at lower margins. And then our organic growth could be expected to reach double digits in the segment in 2011. However, we don't see any improvements to state and local government activities, so we're really not counting for anything incrementally out of that space. Next slide. In the Industrial Technology arena, you can see organic growth here was 21%. We had double-digit order growth in every business that reports into that segment. Our Oil & Gas businesses that go along with the broker pump and a few of the other businesses were exceptionally strong. And we had said earlier this year that we thought we'd do a little bit better on our material test equipment sales, well we did a little better. We did 50% better, which was certainly well above anything we would have envisioned.  We also won Mexico City for Neptune, for products that have been selected for delivery in 2011. And that will add to our Toronto project which is finally underway a little bit in the fourth quarter. For 2011 full year, we think Neptune will be able to grow driven by the Toronto project ramp-up and the Mexico City shipments, and then modest growth in the U.S. water market. We still have copper cost pressures that could drag down pretax earnings as much as $10 million in 2011 if it keeps going at a rate it's going. But hopefully, we won't have to suffer all of that. We expect a record year in Fluid Handling. Everyone of these businesses is doing exceptionally well. And we see a continued recovery in industrial end markets which is very important for our Material Analysis business which could have a record year this next year. Our backlog supports very strong first half in the segment. The DuraTorque products that we're selling for drilling technologies continue to gain share rapidly and our dewatering pump sales are growing very sharply here on 2011. Next slide. Energy Systems & Controls, it was up organically, 26%. You can see orders up 26% as well. Again, we had double-digit growth in every business in that segment, very strong performance for any global activity that was related to oil and gas and we have several businesses in this segment that are and then we had very strong continued momentum in our sensors and analytical instrument businesses. For 2011, we see favorable end markets, particularly in upstream oil and gas, all the process industries in our turbine control business which is performing at a spectacular level. And we see growth and operational execution across the segment in 2011, actually improving the margins from where they are today, and with very solid detailed bridges as to why we think our margins will be better again in 2011. Next slide. Here, if we look at Medical and our Scientific Imaging technology businesses, just again driven by the Verathon acquisition, orders up 41%, sales up 34%. Verathon just performed in an outstanding way both economically and with the growth that they've demonstrated in the fourth quarter and the full year as a whole. We had very strong sales of our small dosage pump business that really has performed at full-time record levels in 2010 and we would expect more of the same next year. medical consumables have been very strong here in the fourth quarter, and we've had quite strong continued growth in the OEM solutions we provide for videoconferencing, things like telepresence and the like. Our full year 2011 to us, it looks again like a double-digit growth year. Medical will continue to do really well with the investment we've made on a global basis and adding sales talent. We've got new product launches that will occur midyear in Verathon, with three new products. And we have a better global reach to be able to launch these things around the world instead of just here in North America.  We've got a record backlog as we enter 2011 for Scientific Imaging, so we really think that that should insulate us from what we would worry about being softness in research funding as the year unfolds on a global basis although we haven't seen that yet. Next slide. If you go beyond just the quantitative numbers in the businesses, these were some critical things we feel we've learned this year. The recovery really continued throughout the year in almost all of our end markets, which is why we went from negative 3% to plus 5%, plus 14% and plus 15%. The worst-performing end markets we have all seemed to have bottomed. And while some of them are balancing off the bottom much, they're all trending a little bit more favorably. And we have fewer downside risk concerns going in to 2011 and in '10, or about finished with all of our 2011 through '13 planning, and struck by the confidence level that all of our business leaders have about 2011 compared to where we were last year at this same time. The businesses we thought would do well this year really dramatically outperformed our assumptions. Some of these businesses were up 50% and we would've expected small double-digit growth from them. Our niche businesses held or gained share during the downturn. We had been worried that some of these would be attacked by larger companies that aren't in the space today who would try to enter. I think some of that happened, and they were really thwarted, our entry barriers proved to be quite significant against anybody trying to enter these markets in which we participate.  And our growth investments in R&D and product development and sales channel development are really helping drive this organic growth you've seen in the second half of the year and why we have confidence going into 2011 on organic growth. Our more cyclical business that had variable costs did very well last year in terms of decremental margins, and they've done spectacularly well this year in terms of incremental margins that we've grown.  Our restructuring benefits from the fourth quarter of '08, the first part of '09, along with this organic growth drive have really brought us to margin expansion to heights that most people thought were never attainable.  Our United Toll Service technology customer acceptance in the year was really a wonderful development and allowed us to ship a number of projects that would have been supplied by other people to our own UTS technologies, and it created a number of new bid opportunities for us and programs we're working on throughout the country, people to deploy this much improved technology in the tolling arena. Verathon exceeded our expectations. The integration benefits have been more substantial than we had forecast at the time of the acquisition. The investment in sales coverage and global channel reach and product development, they've been able to churn around immediately into measurable growth. Next slide. So with that, we'll get into our 2011 guidance. Next slide. Here you'll see we're establishing full year guidance on a diluted earnings per share basis of $3.82 to $4.02. We'll talk a little bit about how we make that up. We see sales up on the year between 11% and 13%, which would be organic growth of 9% to 11% in 2011, and then about two points from acquisitions. Our iTrade acquisition will roll over in the second half of the year, so we really don't have a lot yet from acquisitions to add to those numbers at the moment. Our foreign exchange rates would be the same as they actually were on January 1 of 2011 as you model what we're doing. A tax rate's an important thing this yea. In 2011, we think will be in around 30% tax. This past year, we were able to close out at 28.1%. The difference in tax as it gives is about $0.11 a share headwind in 2011 versus '10. When you're looking at $3.82 to $4.02, that's in the face of an $0.11 headwind. Our diluted share count of 98.5 million is what we would expect throughout the year, is up from the 2010 number of 96.7 million, and our primary share count closed out the year December 31 at 95.1 million shares, probably would reach 97 million shares at the end of the year. And I do think there are some people that have share counts that are lower out there than what's in reality. So again, diluted share count for the year, 98.5 million primary share count, 95 million now.  And still DEPS at $3.82 to $4.02. First quarter, we're seeing $0.83 to $0.87 in the quarter, which represents about 21.5% for the full year, slightly better than normal, usually we're in the sort of 18% to 21% range for Q1. And then full year operating cash flow should exceed $550 million with once again very, very modest CapEx for 2011. Next page. So in summary, what we have here is just a wide variety of all-time performance records that were established in 2010. We had the $500 million in operating cash flow, 20% in free cash flow to sales, really quite outstanding margin leverage as the growth continues and then broad-based momentum throughout the enterprise which gives us the belief that we'll have a strong record year at 2011. And with that, I think we can open it up, John, for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Question on Energy. You had some very strong orders, talked about the oil and gas markets really picking up. So just looking at the leverage to the cyclical versus some of the seasonal lumpy, would we be looking a little more level loaded year for that business than normal?
B. Jellison: In 2011, you mean?
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Yes.
B. Jellison: Well, we had dropped margins in Q1 this year in Energy with some things that were self inflicted, and we don't expect that to happen. So yes, I think you should see more level margins throughout the year as opposed to down in Q1 and catching up in the rest of the year.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: And what about from a demand perspective?
B. Jellison: A lot of the Energy businesses have little longer lead time than the rest of our book-and-ship kind of businesses, and we're seeing very strong backlog and lots of activities. So we wouldn't see any falloff during 2011 in terms of our sales. If there was any order softness, we are not seeing anything that would indicate order softness in the upstream area.
John Humphrey: But Christopher, in terms of the fourth quarter activity where we normally see stronger performance out of a couple of those businesses and their end markets and their customers kind of spend what’s in their budgets, that returned. So that seasonality returned in 2010. We would expect to see that continue in 2011 as well.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: And then just my other follow up on the timing of the Verathon new products and the adoption curve and ramp of that business, obviously pretty impressive. Could we get a little color on what's coming through pipeline there?
B. Jellison: Well, I think they prefer to let their customers know rather than their competitors at the moment. So we'll stand down on that and we'll talk about them when they're launched. I think they'll be noticed by the market place.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Deane Dray with Citi.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: Brian, I'd be interested in hearing some further color around the comment of that state and local municipalities having a more of a challenging budget outlook, not surprising there. But just in terms of is this affecting tolling bidding projects? And is there any of the E-ZPass delays involved in that as well?
B. Jellison: Well, this past year, we would've been off in those areas in excess of $30 million, and yet, you can still see the performance we've generated. So it's been a drag throughout the year in terms of actual sales and it’s been certainly frustrating. The E-ZPass thing is beyond unbelievable. And I can't say a lot more about it. Some people have written recently that well maybe there'll be a decision in August of 2011. We saw another article from somebody who's talking to somebody saying, "Well, maybe they won't decide then it could rollover to August of 2013." And we have a lot of questions about what's going on there but we have very little influence in it. We just offer them the best technology in the world at the lowest price and continue to pay money to get it tested. And some time somebody will decide something. And now as far as other projects are concerned, the decision making around projects has been very slow. We thought we might get some benefit in 2010 as just the stimulus situation went away. But in fact, there's just very slow decisions. We still got a lot of questions, we got a lot of people who are wanting to convert to our United Toll products and so that's given us kind of a leg up. But we're not assuming any kind of real spike in 2011 on that portion of the business. Now remember in that segment for us, it's now finally less than half of the segment. So we got a lot of other things in the segment that are really driving margin and driving cash and driving economic performance. I do think that our results in terms of revenue have really bottomed on the items in the transportation and traffic arena. We've got a meeting later this week to kind of refresh where we are, I know people are starting to develop a little bit more confidence.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: And then just a clarification on the copper headwind for Neptune. Does Neptune do advanced purchasing? And how much of that additional copper price can be passed through to the customer?
B. Jellison: Well, certainly we do some advanced purchasing. We do several things here although we never found it meaningful to hedge because we don't have enough volume. And it's just that the sharp rise in copper, pretty overwhelming and so we model it against our mix of things and the copper content we had. We've been very successful in reducing the copper content inside the water meters itself but on a residential meter basis, it's not easy to get pass-throughs the way we can in our pump businesses. We generally, are maybe six months ahead of what we think consumption is going to look like, so we have a pretty good idea around that. But at the end of the day, we're going to have some leakage. We try to do surcharges on material. We try to certainly do pass through on bids, but it's a challenge.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: And just an observation, I see that the segment is now Medical and Scientific Imaging, and how you present it really reflecting the whole portfolio transformation with Verathon bringing you much more of a medical side of the story. Is that both become an official reported segment as well?
B. Jellison: Yes. Well, the real reason is that Medical is now over half of the segment. So the Imaging continues to wane as a portion of the total segment, still critically important but it's mostly Medical now.
Operator: And next we'll go to Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Brian, you talked about the growth investments you made during the downturn. What's your R&D spend like right now? And has it been trending a little higher as a percentage of sales given the growth in some of your, maybe call it, higher tech and gross margin businesses?
B. Jellison: The R&D spend in 2010 was a little over $100 million. So that was up sharply from 2009. 2009 and '08 are about the same in the mid-80s I think. And 2010 was $102 million. But what happens, it's important to understand, is remember you think about a little less than half of R&D is kind of an administrative services that we do, revenue management for people and stuff like that. There's not a lot of R&D in there. So R&D spend is a function of revenues, is very high in Medical and Scientific Imaging, reasonably high in Energy, quite modest in Industrial other than in Neptune, and then mixed in our RF software business, most of that stuff we don't treat as R&D. And then we've really spent quite a bit of money in adding to our global reach and sales development, MarCom and Web access and things like that for each of the divisions.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: And then with that, are you comfortable with your current investment rates? Or with your record margins right now, you think you will use some of that maybe goose your investments even more and maybe even pick up more market share in '11 looking out into '12?
B. Jellison: Well, I think that we have an aggressive internal measurement that the field people use. It would be rare that field people would come in with spending strategies that we wouldn't embrace. Product development and product management is kind of a critical skill set within the company. I mean product managers always like to have more but they have all that they really need. I think you'll see our excess cash that we throw off likely to get reinvested in acquisitions as we've been doing for a long period of time, and the opportunities in the pipeline are pretty interesting.
Operator: And next we'll go to Wendy Caplan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
Wendy Caplan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: One of your most successful strategies, I think, internally has been to lower the break even across the company. Can you give us some examples of what you see as potential, some ideas about how you might potentially continue to lower the break even as we go into 2011?
B. Jellison: Well, certainly, the break even for us continued, it dropped in 2010 as a function of revenue, the nominal breakeven number for sales went up a little bit in 2010. Our breakeven as a function of revenue probably at the lowest point in our history if I have to say, if you get back to the early '90s or something probably not, I'm not sure about that because it wasn't collected that way, and I don't know how you could really segregate the mixed and variable cost component. That would be a pure guess. But in the last 10 years, we're at the best position we've been. And I think IT technology continues to improve. And while we don't believe in enterprise-wide IT strategies, we do believe in look here's four we're willing to go with. And people get to pick the one that best suits their business so you have a couple of different CRM opportunities here and you have different kind of things related to how you're going to pull things through the factory operations, all of those are very good. John, you might want to take a swag at that?
John Humphrey: No, I think what you've said covers it. For us, Wendy, it's as much around making sure that our operating leaders are always focused on the leverage ratios. And I think you've seen our leverage on incremental sales actually get a little bit better as we have moved from the 2008 range in through 2010, looking into 2011. So we look at that fixed cost leverage and the breakeven point as a key input and one of the things that all of our businesses need to manage to make sure that the leverage on the growth opportunities that are there really delivers to the bottom line.
Wendy Caplan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: And along with that, John, and Brian, you've done a great job with your working capital. I mean do we get to the point where, I mean, I feel almost foolish saying this is as good as a guess given that it's so amazing. But do we think there's still a little room there?
B. Jellison: Well, there's a little room. There's always a little room. We're blown away at this 5.4% number. I have to say one of the things we do, we pay bonuses on incremental operating profit performance, and then there's quite a big kicker for asset velocity. It’s safe to say we're paying a lot of bonus money this year for the asset velocity ticker in our Industrial and Energy businesses. They have really performed remarkably. I don't see anything that says they get any worse. I would think they get a little bit better. They've gotten dramatically better in receivables management in their global businesses, they've got dramatically better inventory. And then we have also the last several acquisitions we've made, Verathon is just, man, they got a lot of turns here at Verathon because we really put that stuff through quickly. And then the software businesses don't really have any inventory to speak of. So we're getting mixed variances that have to do with our strategy of the kind of assets we want to own versus people that are in full-line integrated manufacturing.
Wendy Caplan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: And speaking of that, finally, the M&A environment is clearly been improving. You have notably bought high margin kind of asset-like businesses that generate a lot of cash with an emphasis on the SaaS businesses most recently. Are there any other factors or nuances that you're seeking in terms of acquisitions? And can you say something about what's out there for you?
B. Jellison: Well, there's a lot of stuff that's for sale last year, a lot of private equity transactions wound up not getting into the sale category as they were really able to refinance at extremely attractive rates, and kind of had an opportunity to double dip, if you will, where they get refinancing take out fees and then they can go ahead and sell them again later in 2011 or '12 or whatever. So as long as the finance arrangements in terms of what people are willing to staple on the transactions remains as high as it is, and it's frankly ridiculous levels in our opinion. There's a lot of bid ask spread variances that are still there. But I think people want to make sure that they do exit their positions that they've hope to exit in 2010 and 2011. We've seen an awful lot of activity. Certainly there's so much opportunity, Wendy, the challenge is we don't want to do something that's good at the expense of the substantially better. And so we're, I think you'll see us be slow in the first month of the year because there's just so many different things that we're currently doing diligence on.
Operator: And next, we have Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: First, can you give a little more color, Brian, was the amount in the Houston Tolling project that pulled from '11 into '10 substantial? Could you quantify that? And then similarly talk about what the incremental ramp looks like with Toronto and Mexico City in '11 versus '10?
B. Jellison: Well, I think we were kind of assuming we'd be in the $40 million range for Houston in 2011, and about somewhere like $10 million move into the fourth quarter I think, or a little more maybe. So that what it does is it gives us a little bit harder incremental comparator, and it gave us a little more income in Q4. The problem is that these projects like Houston don't carry the kind of margins that you're accustomed to seeing with us. They accrete to us eventually but boy at the beginning of these, they're relatively low-margin projects.
John Humphrey: And then our Toronto, we had some revenue kind of mid-single digit revenue for that in 2010, and that will start ramp up in 2011 so we're counting on that for somewhere in the $20 million to $30 million range for 2011 and they're reaching kind of that level and they will be a little bit above that going into 2012. Of course, we're talking in $200 million or so over a five-year to six-year period. So there'll be a ramp-up and then it will come down a little bit on the Toronto side. And in Mexico City, the results are going to be adding to us for Neptune somewhere in the kind of mid-teens of millions of dollars for 2011.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: And then just one follow-up, on the Oil & Gas business, how much would you guys, say today, is being driven by upstream versus downstream activity? And can you just provide a little more granularity into your thoughts regarding the growth outlook in those two buckets, if you will, for 2011?
B. Jellison: Well, certainly the V-shaped bounce we got out of Energy was really upstream. So there's quite substantial upstream activity. Now in the case of our directional growing of business, that's a different situation, right? So they have reintroduce the proprietary technology that's really clearly superior to what people have used in the past. So it's growing really well. And if I think we'd do that because it's less around the economy and more about the disruptive technology we have introduced, it allows people to drill deeper, faster and with much better performance. But in the other category in Energy, it's mostly upstream. The refinery business that we have an instrumentation is in a lag in our segment. But still up and it's going to continue to be up, just not at that pace, favorable change the rest of the segment has.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: I just want to circle back for a second, when you say you've won Mexico City at Neptune, is that meters and RF automation? And can you just give maybe scale and scope of that project?
B. Jellison: It's meters. It's just meters periodically from time to time, we get those and the reading technology that goes on them is variable based on what’s happened. It's not the first time we've gotten an update from Mexico City. So it's not like a system win that you're going to have a $100 million over four years. It's pretty much 2011 throughout the year growing against something as John said, it's in the low-teens of millions of dollars.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: And then when I switch down to the RF-tech segment, what do you think, Brian, the margin profile looks like there through calendar '11? Because we've got iTrade that's accretive. We'll have certainly, Houston, that may be pulls that in a little bit. Can we work off of kind of a 23% EBIT margin as a floor here going forward?
B. Jellison: Well, let's do a couple of things here. A part of it is the mix of what happens in a quarter, right? So if you look and there's a reconciliation, two reconciliation pages that are in the appendix that show you by quarter. And we try to make this really granular this time where you'll see in a reconciliation in OP line, the amortization line separate and then an EBITA number, and then appreciation added through EBITDA, we gave you the revenue number, we gave you the EBITA margins. So for instance, and RF in the fourth quarter, the EBITA margin was 29.7%, EBITDA margin was 31.2%. In the fourth quarter, I think our intangible amortization was about right at $25 million. Our full year intangible amortization for '10 was about $86 million. So clearly, you're seeing the effects of the intangible amortization on iTrade, which is quite sizable. And the A portion, which has nothing to do with the reinvestment CapEx or anything else is going to be like $100 million. So that tends to pull down operating profit margins and it is, in our view, a foolish way for somebody to think about how well the company is performing. So you'll see a continued growth in iTrade. It will add significantly to our cash performance. It will add less aggressively to the OP margin line. So that's an important distinction. And then the Tolling traffic business is less than half the segment. It comes in at dramatically lower gross margins. We are not talking 50% and 60% there. We are talking very much less than that. And then its operating profit margin is relatively good given its low gross margins. Then the rest of the segment, let's say it gets to be 55%, 60% or more, it's going to have highest gross margin profile higher than imaging does and it's going to come in with the EBITDA higher than any portion of the enterprise. So it's a hard question to answer and say, "Well use a 23 plug." I don't think I'll do that. But it's easy to put a plug-in on a cash performance basis quarter-to-quarter.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: And then maybe just lastly, when I look at the four segments of the business and I'm kind of looking at it relative to your calendar '11 core organic growth guidance of 9% to 11%. What it appears is though there's a comment about RF being double-digit. I assume that's for the whole segment? Energy systems, double-digit?
B. Jellison: They're all quite similar, Rich. If you look at them, we are kind of going this day plus or minus 1%, they're 10% growth in each one of the segments organically in 2011.
Operator: And next we'll go to Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: John, wondering if you could talk a little about how you see organic in the first quarter relative to the full year guidance given a very strong fourth quarter run rate? Obviously, the comps get tougher in the back part of the year so you figure first quarter starts a lot higher, but maybe you could help us with some color there?
John Humphrey: No, you're exactly right. I mean the comparisons, as we continue to ramp up our organic growth in 2010, the comps do get a little bit tougher in the second half. The way we're thinking of this is that the first half should be somewhere in the low, call it, 13% to 17% range, so kind of mid-teens performance in the first half, with kind of mid- to high-single digits in the back half.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then maybe that partly the answer to, Brian, your comment that the first quarter, you're pegging at more like 21.5% for the full year versus that 18% to 20% range. But any other factors we ought to think about there?
B. Jellison: No. I think we've got like this Mexico City thing, Toronto thing, continued rollout on gas and [indiscernible] and those things, we have just very limited effect on when people take shipments. So it's really hard to say much of that. This year, if you look at organic growth like I said before, we're getting minus 3%, plus 5%, plus 14%, plus 15%. It's going to be a little better next year but it's probably ramps down the same way this year ramped up. So I heard John say 13%, or more, I can understand 13% or more. But clearly, first half of the year is going to be in the low-teens organic growth. The second half of the year is going to be more like the average we had for 2010, is my guess. And I think if we have upside of the year, it's probably going to manifest itself in the fourth quarter. I think that our field people are forecasting light in the fourth quarter versus what we would think in -- I don't really blame them for that. It's hard to envision you could have double-digit organic growth every quarter in 2011, but it's certainly possible.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then just a couple of other clarifications, on RF margins, you're not suggesting down margins for the year for the segment, you're just saying there's an element of headwind there on the Houston piece, right?
B. Jellison: Yes. I think that's a fair assumption.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then on the comment that Medical, see double-digit growth, you're talking about for the total segment or just the Medical piece within the overall division?
John Humphrey: Actually, for the entire segment, both and Medical specifically. So Medical will be leading the growth profile for the segment, and that brings the segment up to kind of the average for the company for 2011.
Operator: And that will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Okay. Well, thank you, and thank you all for joining us this morning, and we look forward to talking to you at the end of the first quarter.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference, and we thank you for participating.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Roper's Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now like to turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Coreen, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our third quarter. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We've prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also are available on our website at www.roperind.com. Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2. We'll begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as detailed further in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now if you'll please turn to Slide 3. I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from the participants. Brian?
B. Jellison: Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. So we'll start off with the enterprise overview and then an individual talk through the four segments. I'll talk about updating guidance with the huge increase we've taken in free cash flow in the fourth quarter and the summary in Q&A period. So next slide. On the enterprise overview, you'll see the third quarter was an all-time record for us for any quarter in the history of the company. That included record levels of orders, of sales, the ending backlog, net earnings, EBITDA, cash flow and a whole lot of other metrics as well. Orders were up 31% to $654 million, with organic growth of 20% in orders. RF, we'll talk about a little bit, it was actually down one point organically. If you look at the excluded RF, we were up 32% organically on orders. Sales were up 25% to $605 million. Organic growth there was 14%, again because of some unusual comps in Q3 at RF. It was basically flat, so it would've been up about 22% organically in revenue. Our net earnings were up 49% to $84 million, and our EBITDA was $163 million on that $605 million of sales. So EBITDA finished the quarter at 27%. Free cash flow was up 65% to $133 million, and probably the most startling statistic I can recall seeing free cash flow is now 22% of revenue. That's 158% of cash conversion. So all of these generally are all-time records. Next slide. On the income statement, you can see bookings were up from $499 million a year ago to $654 million, 31%. Our net sales as we said before, up 25%. Gross margins expanded substantially from 50.6% in the third quarter of last year to 53.2% this year, 260 basis points higher. Our income from ops were up 40%. Our operating margin was up from 18.9% to 21.2% in the third quarter, a gain of 230 basis points. And that includes the intangible amortization, that of course is added in from our latest acquisition. Interest expense was up modestly. Other income there, you can see was up $3 million, which is this foreign FX remeasurement benefit that sometimes is positive and sometimes negative. Our tax rate was a little lower than the third quarter last year. It is turning out that Q3, because of the FIN 48 process, is generally going to have the lowest tax rate in the quarter as your prior year rolls off with the filing. We were down 1.4% from the year before, which is not really the FIN 48 portion at all. It's really some improved tax planning that we've been doing over the last several years. So on a FIN 48 basis, the numbers were quite similar. Our net earnings, as you can see, up $84 million versus $56 million, 49%, and of course, the DEPS at $0.87. Next slide. Here in our asset velocity is the same way we've been showing this for several years now, and the improvement continues. Inventory dropped in the third quarter to 7.7% of revenue, down from 9% a year ago. And when you look at the inventory plus receivables, less payables and accruals, you can see we're down to 6.9% when just three years ago, that same math was 12.1% of revenue. So we picked up 520 basis points of sales that we can redeploy in cash. Next slide. Here, the record cash performance is really worth noting and thinking about. Our free cash flow at 22% of sales is certainly an unprecedented number. Our operating cash flow was 23%, meaning we had CapEx of 1% of sales. In the last four years, in 2007, we had free cash flow of $314 million, and in 2008, we had $404 million, in 2009, $342 million. And we've now forecast $435 million to $455 million of free cash flow this year. You put those four years together, and you have free cash flow of over $1.5 billion. I think, also, remarkably, in the quality of our cash flow, if you look at 2008 here, you'll see that year-to-date, free cash flow was 16% of sales. We went through this very difficult economy in 2009 and only dropped down 1 point to 15% free cash flow to sales. And here we are this year with increased growth, and we're already up year-to-date at 19% free cash flow to sales and yet finished the third quarter at 22% free cash flow to sales. As a result, we've raised our guidance by nearly $40 million for cash flow, and we have less than 100 million shares. So you can do the math on how much we've raised our guidance on a free cash flow to share basis. Next slide. Strong financial position, the balance sheet remains quite good. Our cash and undrawn revolver at the end of the quarter stood at $593 million. Net debt was $1.226 billion. Our share holder equity, you can see net-debt-to-cap was at 31.7%. Our net-debt-to-EBITDA, we still have -- it's only at 2.1x and of course, is rapidly improving as the trailing EBITDA continues to come up quickly. And that doesn't even count the performing EBITDA from our acquisitions. And the EBITDA-to-interest coverage, you can see, is over 9x. So we have quite a desirable balance sheet despite the fact that we have now invested just under $900 million in the last 12 months in transactions. Next slide. Here we'll start to take you through the individual segments. Next slide. First thing you notice, this slide allows you to see how the book-to-bill went for each one of the businesses and how FX affected us. You can see on a book-to-bill basis, the company was at 1.08. Scientific Imaging & Medical was at 1.13 being the highest, and Industrial Technology at 1.05 being the lowest, of course it has the fastest through put. On order growth versus the prior year, our Medical and Imaging businesses were up 81%. 25% is organic. So you see the powerful impact of Verathon coming in there. Our Energy Systems & Controls were up 32% organically, and the reason the 29% is in there is we have negative FX pulling it down to 29%. RF Technology was up 7%. But on an organic basis, down 1%. Really, based primarily on toll and traffic comps and the fact that in the third quarter of last year, we had booked the Houston business and the Gaz de France business for the year ahead. So the comps were sort of unrealistic to measure against organically. Industrial Technology, you can see was up 36%, lost a point due to FX. Next slide. Here we'll look at the segment performance from a margin basis, for each one of them. RF came in with gross margins of 49% and EBITDA margins at 28%, Industrial was 51% with 32% gross margins. I think the EBITDA margin at 32% for Industrial was quite a remarkable number, the more you think about that and you listen to other calls from industrial companies. Our Energy segment was up 53% on gross margins, 27% on EBITDA, and Medical and Imaging had 61% gross margin number with 28% EBITDA as we've put a lot more money into R&D in that segment as a function of revenue than in the other businesses. But across the board, it's quite an exceptional margin performance. Next slide. On the RF segment, here we're looking at a business that was order and sales, both up 7%. In the third quarter last year, we booked this Houston Toll project, which actually has had almost no revenue generated over the first 12 months of this activity, which is different than what they had forecasted for us. But the booking took place last year, so that made a tough comp. And in addition to that, we booked a significant portion of initial order from France for our Technolog business. Both those were in the base when we compared the organic numbers. We enjoyed double-digit order growth in our Campus businesses with CBORD and Horizon, which were very helpful. Of course, that rolls over at a high incremental margin. From a sales basis, acquisitions added 8.8% to the number. Organic growth was down 1.1% and FX, 30 bps. Pretty much all of that was driven from lower tag and hardware sales and tolling, and the continued very soft business around Wireless Security, which is, while not large, a very big -B. Tolling project activity in the quarter though was up very sharply and is really quite a good indicator for us around what will happen in 2011. And once again, these are projects we can't articulate because they're either with international customers or domestic people that won't allow us to talk about them. But nonetheless, they were quite encouraged about incremental opportunity for us next year, off of the work we're doing right now with these people. In the fourth quarter, we'll start to see the benefit of the Houston METRO toll project as sales accelerate. We had a nonmaterial amount of revenue in Q3 and expect to pay a pretty substantial increase here in Q4. And then that will roll out through next year. Our Gaz de France AMR installations are well underway and are currently in the fourth quarter. They're going to be running at the normalized rate of the next couple of years. We actually, recently had a board meeting in Paris, and we're party to the initial installation in a big ceremony, and we're quite bullish about where that's going to take us over the next several years. Our CBORD and Horizon growth will continue in the fourth quarter. They were up only modestly last year and that should return to more normal growth profile now. And we'll get the benefit of the entire fourth quarter for iTradeNetwork, which came in really on July 27. So it didn't add as much in Q3 as it will in Q4 and next year. Next slide. Industrial Technology had just absolutely spectacular performance. You can see the orders were up 35%. So that's all organic. Sales were up 23% and EBITDA margins were up 370 basis points over the reported number of a year ago. The operating margin in the year was 27.9%, and the EBITDA margin, the 31.6%, that's equal to or greater than many of the businesses that report gross margins. So I just can't say enough about the quality of the leadership teams we have in these businesses. Every one of them really did an outstanding job. It's a record margin performance for the family. And Neptune had an all-time record in orders in the third quarter for its history, and they were up well in excess of 35%. Our Material Test business continued to rebound nicely with a big improvement in consumables for our Cutting Technology businesses. And the Fluid Handling businesses had an extraordinary quarter, and we expect that to continue as we've launched a new line of drill products called DuraTorque, which is opening up new gas exploration opportunities for us. We just celebrated a large situation out in Aberdeen, Scotland, and we see a lot of forward growth in that particular business. And then in our Water businesses, the pumps for rental markets are up substantially, and we picked up one of the more important rental companies and changed to our products. In the fourth quarter, you'll see we think we'll have favorable trends, that should continue. But we don't really see any slacking off in these nominal numbers, we think they'll incrementally be higher. And performance ought to remain at these high margin levels in the fourth quarter. Perhaps the most encouraging for us is that there is still really room for these businesses to grow. None of them are back to either the 2007 or 2008 peaks they enjoyed, and so we think they'll continue to do well as we move into 2011. Next slide. Here if we look at Energy Systems, you'll see that, again, across-the-board order strength throughout all of these different businesses. Orders were up 29%. Of course all organic again and sales up 20%. We continue to enjoy a rebound in our Dynisco businesses when analytical instruments and in sensors, we had pretty decent gains in all of the oil and gas end markets particularly the protective technology issues with diesel engines. And then our longer-term oil patterns with longer lead times were really quite good, and our Compressor Control business, in terms of delivery to LNG plants with large orders in Asia for 2011 delivery. Fourth quarter, we expect to have double-digit growth again. We look forward to strong seasonal Q4 demand. We saw a return of that last year and every indication would be, it would be strong again this year. And we think we'll have continued growth with operational execution giving us even better margins in the fourth quarter than we enjoyed here where our EBITDA margin was 26.9%. Next slide. Next slide will be the Medical & Imaging arena. This is up 81% with organic orders up 25%. Organic revenue, sales up 16%. Terrific quarter for Verathon. We're really getting a lot of traction from increasing the sales force and focusing on international opportunities. We had a large order for Saudi, which is the kind of things that we're able to do with the business that are harder for smaller businesses to do on their own and turned at reaching out to more diverse markets. Our Medical Consumables business did quite well. Double digit growth in the third quarter. We expect more of the same, and we have a dosage delivery, Medical Pump business, but we don't talk a lot about which had a spectacular third quarter as its kidney dialysis products are coming online at a fast rate. Our Life Science and Physical Science businesses grew the way we thought they would in the third quarter. We think they'll do okay once again in the fourth quarter. We have an important product line coming out of our MEDTEC Radiation Oncology business, which is a couch top that goes on with other MRI equipment. It's going to be featured next week, literally at the American Society for Radiation Oncology, Astro Tradeshow. It's a very important product for us that we hope will drive much better growth in that business in 2011. And Medical, we expect will continue to grow in double digits led by Verathon in the fourth quarter. Next slide. Here we'll kind of update the scenario around guidance. Next Slide. We've increased the DEPS guidance, it was $3.05 to $3.15, so we've taken that up $0.17 at the low-end of $3.22, and $0.11 at the high-end of $3.26. That gives us Q4 guidance of $0.96 to $1. Despite earning $0.87 in the third quarter, some of which of course was improved tax, we still think we can make -- have the possibility to make a dollar. We wouldn't have thought -- our guidance for Q3 was $0.75 to $0.80 as I recall. So we're quite comfortable with the concept of $3.22 to $3.26. It's certainly much higher than we would've ever expected at the beginning of the year. Last year, as reported, was $0.77. So that's a 25% to 30% increase over the prior year. But much more importantly than the earnings guidance in our view is the cash flow guidance where we've made a huge increase in our cash flow. We've raised our prior guidance of $425 million of operating cash flow to $450 million. We're now saying operating cash flow will be $465 million to $485 million or more. And we would expect CapEx will come in at less than $30 million for the year. So when we look at a $40 million increase in what effectively is free cash flow with less than 100 million shares of stock outstanding, I would ask you to think hard about just how much we've increased our guidance on a cash flow per share basis. Next slide. In Q3 summary, this is the kind of slide you'd like to kind of put up and then put it up again and put it up a third time. It's the best quarter in the history of the company bar none. Orders, $654 million, up 31%, sales $605 million up 25%, net earnings up 49%, free cash flow, $133 million in the quarter. I think last year it was $80 million. So it's up 65%. Organic growth up 20%, and orders in 14% and sales with a lumpy flat quarter in RF. Book to bill of 1.08, backlog at $770 million. Those of you who have followed us for a long time, we didn't even use to have sales that high. Gross margin, 53%, EBITDA 27%, and free cash flow to sales is 22%. iTradeNetwork is doing really well. We've got very setting things going on internationally already with iTrade, and the integration's well underway. We were able to close the books in a timely manner, which is always a wonderful beginning. And despite the fact that we've invested $900 million, we're sitting with a very strong balance sheet and building cash at a very fast pace. And then of course we increased our guidance, as you see, to $3.22 to $3.26 with the operating cash flow of $465 million to $485 million, and free cash flow on the high-end, maybe at $455 million or $454 million. We now know that 2010 should be the best year in the history of the company. And frankly, we think we'll have an improvement over this year in 2011 as we start to prepare for next year. So with that, we should open it up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: John, wondering if maybe you can just help us with this bridge on the change in operating cash flow guidance, be a midpoint of EPS range, about $0.14 or $14 million. You talked about CapEx below $30 million but I don't think that's a change. I'm just trying to understand what's happening at the working capital level or other issues to help drive that better cash flow guidance?
John Humphrey: Well, I think it really comes down to, a, the improvement in the earnings but also, we continue to work and get better at receivables collections and inventory performance, both of which are improved in the quarter versus where we were last year. And as you know, as you get closer to the end, you get more confidence over how the cash is actually going to roll in. And a change in just a few days here and there could have a large impact with the amount of cash that we receive and disburse on a regular basis. So as we look at our cash collections so far during this month as well as the performance that we've seen on the receivables side, it makes us feel comfortable with the new guidance range.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And Brian, as you pointed out, working capital of sales, pretty stunningly low number. I'm wondering what your thoughts are on how that moves as big as the cycle continues to recover. Supply chains, maybe get a little bit more complex. How do you want us to think about this 7% working capital to sales as the cycle moves along?
B. Jellison: Well, I would say that of all of the component parts of that networking capital calculation, even though inventory's at 7.7% of sales, we think that that's the one that's most easily improved. But we still think that our core legacy businesses do a good job but could do a better job on inventory turns. We got pretty high gross margins, right? So, I think we do a great job on balance, but some of our businesses are world-class and not all of them yet have caught up to that. I don't see a negative trend. I mean, we're not going to need to bring in more inventory and carry it for a longer time or have longer lead times and suppliers that would increase our inventories as a function of sales.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then shifting to, Brian, your thoughts on organic growth for 2011. You've talked through a couple of points on the segments and obviously, the first quarter is still a pretty easy comp that presumably you'll stay in the double digits with. But how do you feel about, as you move into the back half of the year on organic across the portfolio for next year, I'm trying to map together what you're seeing from a macro perspective and from the bottom's up perspective that I'm sure you're still working on at this point?
B. Jellison: Well, in a way, we've had kind of a benefit as we head into 2011, and that we've got a couple of projects here that have very been slow to roll out. I mean, good heavens, we've booked a significant portion of this Houston project in the third quarter a year ago, and so that's going to start to be sold here in Q4 next year. I mean, we know that for a fact. It's not a iffy thing. So I think we don't have headwinds going into organic growth in 2011. Certainly, the first quarter, we just finished the first halves of our Industrial group's strategic planning, and came away feeling like "Man, you were back to the Q4 2008 before the devastating recession hit in terms of how individual inertia is strong, and they've got a lot of product innovations." So they feel pretty bullish. But I have to reserve our overall enterprise until we finish the rest of the segments. But I think, certainly, 2011, we expect would be better than this year's actual numbers, and we got quite a few favorable things. We've got exceptionally high margin acquisition in there. We've got baseline growth in some things we're doing internationally. We've had a lot of things that have been postponed that we don't think would be postponed forever. So it's a little early for guidance, but we certainly feel as good going into 2011 as we did going into 2010.
Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then just last quick modeling, John, what are you assuming for 4Q tax rate in the guidance? I heard Brian make a comment about some sustainable, kind of structural improvement. Any thoughts on '11 as well would be helpful?
John Humphrey: Sure. As far as the fourth quarter is concerned, it'll be somewhere in the 29% range, is what we're expecting for the fourth quarter. And that really brings our full year to kind of in the 28% to 29% range. Now of course -- and we do always have some upward pressure, particularly as we fell more in the U.S. where tax rates are some of the highest in the world. So we'll be fighting that type of headwind, that as we start to look forward into 2011, it will probably be somewhere in the 30% to 31% range. And then we'll just have to see if we can have any other good tax planning ideas in order to bring that down a little bit. So we'll have to wait until we get to guidance on anything more specific than that.
Operator: Moving on to Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Can you discuss a little bit more on iTrade, give an update of how the integration is going? I mean, are you still looking at like $0.01 in EPS in fiscal '10? And then what kind of revenues are you expecting on a quarterly basis?
B. Jellison: Well, John can give you a better idea about earnings increase, and then we'll talk a little bit more, Mark.
John Humphrey: Sure. Actually, as far as earnings accretion is concerned, we had already assumed kind of when we announced this back in July that they would add $0.02 or $0.03 to the full year. And we're right on track for that, so we're expecting it to add a couple of pennies in the fourth quarter. And then as we look forward into 2011, consistent with what we had said back in July at the announcement times, so this is going to deliver at least $55 million of EBITDA, of course, in 2011. This is a high margin business. So this is something that's going to add somewhere in the $90 million to $100 million of revenue in 2011. And other than that, I'll turn it over to Brian for the integration activity.
B. Jellison: Well, I think, integration in iTrade, this was a -- it's a very solid group of people. And there have been some consideration about taking them public, because these businesses have such high multiples. But as we were explaining to them, it's a little hard to do that, once you're using QuickBooks. So we've had to do a whole lot of accounting support. We have one of our best people who's been working with them to get them to be able to bring in their worldwide numbers. Because even though it's not an enormous business in revenue, it's got a global reach. And we're also doing a lot in terms of international development with them, and we have quite a few M&A things we're running the ground with them in terms of small bolt-ons to the business. So we spend a disproportioned amount of time in the last third quarter, let's call it, doing things. But all of the people aspects are going very well, and all of the administrative integration is going well. And I think Roper lending adds credibility to what's a relatively small company has helped them out a lot with these very large chains particularly in Europe, and we expect to be announcing some International business in the not-too-distant future here. So we're quite happy with it.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: And then finally, no pun intended, but can you drill down into Energy Systems & Controls a bit more? Is it more upstream or downstream that you're seeing some good growth? And then your Sensors and Analytical Instruments business, what's the relative size and what kind of growth have you been seeing there? By single or low double-digits? What have you being seeing there?
B. Jellison: All those businesses you can see are -- some of them are strong bounce back stories. They're up closer to 30% than high single digits. If there's two different things going on here, our Industrial business, not in Energy, we have Roper pump, which is traditionally an oil and gas play. But it's a pretty well vertically integrated manufacturing operation. They've developed a new line of products called DuraTorque, which are fundamentally going to change some of the ability to do drilling, used to be more focused on med pumps. The DuraTorque product line is something that gives us proprietary technology that has kind of been starting somewhat in the third quarter, gaining great momentum as people see how effective it is compared to the competition. So that's certainly going to grow at a pretty fast rate in a relatively small-market. On the Energy Systems side, those businesses are really more around the throughput of activity and making things better on an efficiency basis. So they're not very easily tied to rig count. So we are tied to upstream and downstream type of activity. And all of those are universally up. The one business we have in there that's been spotty, which did well in the third quarter is our Petroleum Analyzer Instrumentation business, which primarily goes into refining, and refining is still not doing as well as the rest of the end markets.
Operator: Moving on to the Citi Investment Research from Deane Dray.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: I was hoping we could drill down a bit into the RF business. This last quarter, if I recall, had a book-to-bill of 1.11 with flat revenues. And this quarter again, we came up a little short on the revenue side. So is this all tied to the Houston project? Just would've thought, based upon that bookings last quarter, we would've start seeing some of the revenues coming through. But what else might be at play here?
B. Jellison: It's mostly just that simple. I mean, it's quite a large project and it's been -- deployment on it has been slow. But we also have this Wireless Sensor business, it's an OEM business that sells to big security companies and it's been affected negatively of course because of commercial construction activity around the world. And while it isn't a very big business, it gives us -Bs to overcome. Looking at the book-to-bill isn't necessarily -- you almost need to look at it over a 12-month trailing basis to get an idea that bookings, what happens is that CBORD and Horizon and some of the software businesses are doing really well. So it looks like the thing's flat but you got some stuff up sharply and other stuff down.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: And what's the policy in terms of what constitutes an order to be booked? Is that shipments within 12 months? And would you ever de-book?
John Humphrey: So along those lines, the short answer is yes. Whatever is shipped within 12 months. And we have had the bookings in the past. If a project is canceled, if an order is completely canceled, we have absolutely had situations where we've had to de-book something. It doesn't happen very often. And what has happened vertically with the Houston METRO, where we did go ahead and book a roughly the first year's worth of that last year in the third quarter. The timing associated with that continue to slip a little bit each quarter, always staying within the 12-month window. We do feel very confident. We're already doing work, so this will be delivering revenue in the fourth quarter. So I hope that answers your question.
Deane Dray - Citigroup Inc: It does. And just a last question for me on this RF side is related to the College and University business with CBORD and Horizon. I have a sense that during the summer months when the schools try to do all their infrastructure type of investments. But how about on the systems basis like CBORD, is there any seasonality to how these institutions make their decisions?
John Humphrey: Yes, there is. And in fact, you'll see the booking's always a little bit higher for CBORD and Horizon in the summer months, sometimes it's Q2, sometimes it's in Q3 depending on when the customers are making their decisions there. However, from a revenue recognition standpoint, we spread that revenue throughout the 12-month period that we're delivering the service. So there's a small component, maybe 20% or 30% of their revenue, which is associated with new installations of hardware. So that might be new security applications, new point-of-sale devices, et cetera. The vast majority of their revenue is software-related, and that's the part that is spread throughout the 12 months. It also is a component of our deferred revenue balance as we get paid in advance for that activity. It's a great cash flow generator for us.
Operator: Alex Blanton of Ingalls & Snyder has our next question.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: You made a nice acquisition in the third quarter. What is the acquisition outlook going forward? Can you comment in general on pricing and the acquisition arena and what you might be doing there?
B. Jellison: Well, there's a frenzy for people to try to get stuff in between now and the end of the year. There's an awful lot of things happening with a lot of things that are for sale. We have an enormous pipeline. I would say that as the diligence medals threw on them, that we're finding -- it's a good thing that we have good diligence. There's a lot of stuff for sale, not all of which is wonderful. People trying to get close before the end of the year, and there's all kinds of issues with private equity with lots of money on the sidelines, and they need to get it invested or will perhaps, not be able to have their capital calls on people. There's just a lot going. Pricewise, I would say that pricing is not as far apart as it was a year ago because it's a little easier for the buyer and the seller to have a better understanding around what the trailing numbers are and what the first year numbers look like. I would say that for the first part of this year, it would -- generally, private equity transactions were at least as high as public market transactions which is kind of ridiculous and not the norm. I think that's kind of come into a more stable area. So generally, we find it a bit outspread now. It may be one or two or 2.5x EBITDA, and then you got to find whether you could narrow that gap or not. So since we really buy things to grow them, we're really focused on the things that we can buy and add value to through channel management and market reach and better end-user value pricing and things like that, and maybe some supply chain stuff. There's no end to the kind of things we can look at, at the moment. If you were looking at a number of things outside the U.S., which is unusual, that's because those at the moment are the most attractive. I don't think we'll do anything, close anything between now and the end of the calendar year here with nine weeks to go or something. But I don't think we'll be pulling back on our run rate of $500 million to $600 million of acquisitions or more annually.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: And the reason for the frenzy, is it more than normal? Is it legislative risk, or what is it?
B. Jellison: Yes, there are several different things. One is you got the risk of carried interest being taxed as ordinary income. So there's a desire to get a lot of transactions done under the wire on that. And if you got something that is, you think you can really sell at a decent price, it's a good time to dispose of it for that reason. Secondly, the debt markets are just -- it's unbelievable. We're seeing 6x, 6.5x debt staples on everything now. So it's just quite easy for things to get refinanced. We had a transaction that we have been working on for a while where we finally passed because the guy can do it, he can basically refinance his debt at 6.5x his trailing EBITDA number, pay himself a big dividend and sell it again next year. There's a lot of that going.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: And finally, could you comment on what you're doing in China? I mean lots of companies are looking at growing faster over there. What are your opportunities in China?
B. Jellison: Well, we are growing faster in China than in the rest of the portfolio as a whole. We just don't have a huge base. We have one fiscal operation in Malu, which we've expanded and in fact, relocated from one factory facility last year to a newer larger facility recently. That's primarily around the Energy Systems products for the most part. We've got a common series of systems in selling and legal entities around that, that gives us a pretty good reach for products as they come online. Our Energy Systems business, a lot of its growth this year is in Asia. Now some of that is in Australia and Malaysia, Indonesia. But China has had an important part as well. When you look at medical products, frankly, growth in Europe and the Middle East and the U.S. is better. Price points in China for those kind of products that are really not very interesting and when you look at a good, better, best, they'll take something that's maybe not even good. So that's not us. And when you think then about the sort of Software businesses we have, I mean you can't walk our Freight Matching or CBORD into China with much effectiveness. So it's really around the Industrial & Energy businesses. And as you can see, those guys were up 35% and 30% respectively, and the Asian growth is higher than that base number.
Operator: Moving on to Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Question on the Imaging. We had Verathon for a few quarters now and it's still quite an impressive sequential ramp. Just wondering if you're seeing some of the Japan wins really hit orders? If there's a re-stocking, or it's been more of a built to a run rate given all the market efforts?
John Humphrey: Well, I'm not sure I understood the Japan portion but as a rule, whenever we have any type of Japanese funding plus or minus, that's going to affect our camera companies, more so than our Medical businesses. Verathon is really an organic growth story, building in the infrastructure and investments in the sales force. And those folks are really doing a very good job of managing their ramp rates, their learning curve and really hitting the ground and continuing to expand with the product lines that they have. And then also, they've won some very nice orders with Saudi Arabia, as well as with the military. And so all of those things should continue the double-digit growth that Verathon had before we acquired them and they continue that and maybe even a little bit better post-acquisition.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: And on the tolling project bid activity up sharply, just wondering what you're kind of anticipating as the conversion cycle compared to sort up the trend that Houston established with a lot of bureaucracy to work through?
B. Jellison: Well, unfortunately, there's always a lot of bureaucracy to work through in all these business. So the conversion cycles, we have learned are unpredictable. The ones that we're talking about now though, we think are relatively fast. So we think we're out in front, showing people the opportunity to convert some of our installed base to our United Toll System technology that we're delivering. We've got some very important trials underway and installations that are happening that are going to add organic growth for us certainly next year. And then we have some international transactions that we can't talk about that we're quite confident will be converted in 2011. So I don't think we're going to have another Houston situation where we're waiting almost for a year to get our first billing. I don't think that's the case.
Operator: Vertical Research Partners, next question comes from Jeff Sprague.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: First on cash flow, not to diminish the cash flow because it's fantastic. But I'm wondering, Brian, can you give us a sense of how much of it's mix related as you grow CBORD and businesses like that versus organic improvement in the operating or the ongoing companies?
B. Jellison: Well, of course, we've owned CBORD for a while, so we would consider that to be organic as it grows. And certainly, it does point out that the way that we've been developing Roper over the last nine years is to get these asset-light businesses that throw off a lot more cash. We talk about EBITDA and we report operating margins. What people should really focus on are our EBITA margins. If you look at our EBITA margins, for instance, in Industrial in the quarter, they were 29.9%. In Energy, they were 25.4%, and Medical Imaging, they were at 26.8%. In RF, they were 26.6%. People focusing on a 20% of the P [ph] in RF, the reality is a 26.6% on a cash basis. So the more we grow our Software businesses and the more we grow our asset-light businesses, the more cash as a function of revenue we'll generate. So it really helps. But right now, you've got stellar performance in all of our Industrial Energy businesses around cash generation because they don't need to add any CapEx, and they've don't need to add much in the way of resources to capture all the margin associated with their revenue. And the gross margins in all these businesses are basically 50% or higher. So if you look this year, EPS is up the most of any of the components when we think about that. So that's really helpful on the guidance raise, is driven the least by acquisitions, the most by net earnings growth and then somewhat by better visibility around what's going to happen on all of the respective balance sheets.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: And then kind of taking that kind of to the next step, if you look at the M&A that you've done, obviously, you've done some really attractive deals in RF and MEDTEC. Does your bias toward asset-light kind of lead you away from Industrial & Energy over time? You've got some nice asset-light businesses in those portfolios. But I'm wondering just in terms of kind of the target, the potential target companies that would fit your MO, if they're really out there, or there's too much competition for them regardless?
B. Jellison: Well, I don't think there's too much competition for them. I mean, we don't see that. I think, although, we are surprised sometimes at people paying, buying other public companies with control premiums is not something you'd likely see us do. And we do look at Industrial transactions. In order for us to get excited about it, we wouldn't want to see a lot of depreciation and replacement CapEx that's required in those businesses. So to the degree that there's nothing wrong with Industrial markets at all, but we don't want to have deeply vertically integrated factories. So we're still looking at assets in that arena. I mean, we're looking at a company in Europe as we speak. They do tend to get crowded out by the higher cash return businesses that are available to us in RF and Medical. So there's no real -- we don't have a bias against anything. We're absolutely just all about the cash return. If we can get the cash return to look right, and it fits any of our leadership capabilities, then we're all for it. But our number one filter on businesses is whether we think they can grow and have the right leadership component. And our number two filter is whether they hit the kind of cash returns that we're going to demand of them going forward. And if they do that, then we'll focus third on the market that they're in.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: Just switching gears, on the tolling stuff that you're alluding to bidding on, I'm just wondering if you can give us some update on kind of the state of the customer at the type for kind of the unique or more technologically advanced. Other words, kind of plain vanilla tolling versus maybe doing something with realtime pricing, or creative use of HOV lanes or different things like that. Are you seeing more of that more kind of uptake in interest in the space?
B. Jellison: I would say, we have more discussions than any real reality around realtime pricing. The politics on realtime pricing are pretty overwhelming. As a general rule, realtime pricing is going to be driven by a green orientation, and might get defeated by the politics of people who don't want to have to pay to enter the city. When you go to the technology, people have a big trade-off on the quality of the tag they use and what the read of that tag is and what happens. It's very important around accuracy. So we believe we have far and away the most accurate products and the best family of products for people to choose from. So you can use a wide variety of things we can deploy. Those people who look at well, what if I did a lower cost technology, sometimes we'll bid it that way, but when it's finished, they don't go that way. There are more people who have talked to us about really low-cost tags which wouldn't get you the same accuracy or read and would rely more on video tolling to be something buried up to it. I wouldn't say we're not -- we hear people talking about them. We don't see any real activity in the space.
Operator: We'll move on to Wendy Caplan with SunTrust.
Wendy Caplan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: As we look at the RF segment, over time, the Software business has become a greater part. We talked in the past about someone running that business. Can you give us an update on the management of that sector of RF? And then I have another question about margin.
B. Jellison: Well, I can assure you that Rob Bonavito runs iTrade and Tim Tighe runs CBORD and Horizon, and Tim Bickmore is running our Freight Matching businesses and Claude Yonnet and the company running Technolog, and the number of people in Neptune that are focused on software development, all feel they're doing a great job. And we agree with them. So I think the management we have in these phases is really world-class. Now at the sectoral level, if and when we break that off to its own independent family of businesses, we don't have a sectoral leader over that family of businesses. It's certainly possible in the future, we'll do that. It's interesting, we just brought in a new Vice President of HR for the business. And this is a guy whose career while his early upbringing was at Pepsi [ph], he was the HR guy for Compaq when HP bought it and of course was involved in the integration activity around HP and then became the HR guy for Dave over at Nielsen. So he's a guy who understands those kind of businesses and can help us in the selection process around people to staff these businesses going forward. But we're very happy with the quality of the people we have now.
Wendy Caplan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: And in terms of hiring, what are we seeing at this point in terms of adding feed on the street for sales, or engineering talent? Where are we in that process?
B. Jellison: I think we're where we want to be. We've added a lot of people in our Medical business at the first part of this year and in the last part of last year. So I would say that in terms of feed in the street, our businesses are at full employment and very happy. We're still adding some additional people in our CIVCO business around certain things. But for the most part, we're where we want to be on people.
Wendy Caplan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: And just a quick one on Freight Matching, it wasn't really discussed fully. Can you talk about how it's doing?
B. Jellison: It was pretty much flat in the quarter, but flat for them is world-class.
Wendy Caplan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: And finally, you did mention that you saw the margin in Industrial, specifically, was not at its peak level. Overall margin for the company, operating margin, isn't back to the kind of 30% level. Is there any reason in your mind why that shouldn't be?
B. Jellison: I certainly would not have meant to imply that Industrial margins weren't spectacular. They're beyond that at 31.6% EBITDA. I think what I was trying to say was that the revenue for the Industrial businesses was not back to 2007 and '08 levels, which is a cause for optimism for us as we look at 2011. And of course, those businesses, just as you see the EBITDA and operating profit margin was up quite a bit in them, on a comparative basis in the quarter as they generate more growth, that comes in with very nice positive leverage. And that will continue to allow the margins to go up if they grow.
Wendy Caplan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: And my question about operating margin getting back to prior peak, is there any reason why we shouldn't expect that?
John Humphrey: Well, actually, Wendy, from a standpoint of, I think, the prior peak for us, the operating margin in 2008 was right at 21.1%. And I believe on a year-to-date basis, we're probably at about 20.9% of that, do the math. That's just eyeballing it, I think that's about where we are. I mean kind of as Brian said, we don't think of prior peak, meaning the future peak. We always think about the next dollar revenues is going to deliver somewhere in the $0.30 to $0.35 range and we'll continue to get margin expansion as we continue to grow.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We'll now return back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humphrey: Thank you, Coreen, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I know that there were a couple of folks who are still in the queue, but we did have to close this off. So I'll be following up with you individually. Otherwise, I look forward to talking to you again in about three months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.

Analysts: Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer Mike Schneider – Robert W. Baird & Co. Matt Summerville – Keybanc  Alex Blanton – Ingalls & Snyder  
Operator: Roper First Quarter 2009 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. I will now turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. 
John Humphrey:  Thank you, Anthony, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss the results of our 2009 first quarter. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer for the company, and Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com.  Now if you will turn to slide two, we start with our Safe Harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during today’s call, which are subject to risks, and uncertainties as described on this page and as detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today’s call in the context of that information. And, now if you please turn to slide three, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our participants. Brian?
Brian Jellison: 
.:  Just a word here, we will try to move a little bit quickly this morning. I know that a number of our analysts have a competing call here at 10:30, and I'm sure you would like to hear as much of ours as possible. So we will move quickly. We're going to cover here on slide one a quick overview of the enterprise and a little bit of detail around the segments in terms of how Q1 was and how we think sequentially Q2 will look at then an update of guidance in a summary with a Q&A period. Next slide. So from an overview, the sales were down 6.9% in the quarter. We were up 6.8% with the acquisitions that we have done last year as they favorably impacted the first quarter. Organic growth was down 10.5%, which was couple of points worse than we expected, we will tell you why. And currency hurt us 3.2% in the quarter, which was kind of a $0.03, $0.04 headwind for us. On gross margins, we did very well, almost 50% there, 49.9%, excluding restructuring. Our EBITDA margins were only down 160 basis points, closing out at 23% excluding the restructuring. The area where we outperformed the most internally was on decremental margins. We had feared our decremental margins would be in the 40s because our gross margins of course are so high. When you look at those three segments, that struggled in the quarter, there are collective gross margins of 51%, and yet that decremental margins were only 36%, which we think is really quite outstanding performance from our field people. Our adjusted earnings per share were $0.59 versus last year's $0.67. Just a comment on that $0.67 in your model and you want to look at the information there around the new convertible accounting FASB thing that took effect in January 1 which is in both of these numbers. And then operating cash flow for the quarter was $51 million which is really better than it looks. We will explain in a minute because of unusually heavy Q1 cash usage that will be – we have a table on.  Next slide. One of the things I think we felt good about in this quarter was the governance process that we had used in the fourth quarter to effect the contingency planning and extend that into the fourth quarter. In fact we are continuing to do it now. We had all of our operating people together last week, for most of the week, in the industry and energy segments and the product oriented portion of our RF segments. It was an incredibly positive event in the sense of how close all of these presidents are to their end markets and the customer culture, and what they're learning about the kind of solutions that are going to be required as the market returns to some closer normalcy, at some point in time, and the channel conflict changes that are going to occur, and the nature of products and expectations was really very interesting. Secondly, we were encouraged that no one had cut any development investments. We're still making the same level of market channel investments and product development new launches as always, and in fact with declining sales the R&D spending is actually up as a function of revenue. It was refreshing to see again limited staff as we have. I know you know that is true at our corporate enterprise, but it is pretty well true in the field as well. We were able to get in one room all of the division presidents and all of the controllers, no multiple layers of people at Roper, and you can really get to the core truth quickly and challenge everybody on any variance issues. The low fixed assets meant we didn't have to really close down any kind of large facility because we were having absorption issues. We were able to flex Neptune on very low volumes in a lot of creative ways and none of the other factories had difficult absorption issues. Our breakeven analysis gave everybody the awareness quite early in the fourth quarter about the challenges they would face and certainly if we had thought we could come out with decremental margins of only 36% with 51% gross margins, that would have been remarkable, and that is what they did. There were no targeted broad-based situations where we said take 7% of SG&A out or anything like that. Everything was done on an individual market basis because of such wide variances and aggregate demand. Our SG&A cost model because we are not holding to any particular channel or way we go to market was able to be flexed very quickly and in the first quarter our SG&A expenses actually declined by 14% when we exclude the acquisitions, and we think that is quite an achievement. Next slide. On the decremental margins, here you can look at industrial technology. We were down $43 million in revenue and our change in operating profit was $14.9 million. That is a decremental margin ratio of 35% against a gross margin of 49%. And we think that is quite good in an industrial market. Our energy systems and control segment had a reduction in revenue of $21.8 million. Change in OP is nine, the decremental margin was 43% against a higher gross margin of 54%. If you look at the variants, we were 14 points under the gross margin in industrial technology, and we were 11 points under the gross margin in energy systems and controls. Energy systems and controls will be better, but we have a lot more European-based people, and so the effect of that in our margins will show up better throughout the year and would be worse here in Q1. The scientific and industrial imaging story, while looks the best, actually has a kind of different scenario. Change in revenue was $12 million, change in OP was 34, so it delevered at 27, that is because it was a mix change in the Rugged Mobile, which really pulled down our organic growth. And that is a very low margin business, so it doesn't mean we performed better decrementally. It just was an easier target. And then in total, you can see $77 million down in the three segments that had lower sales, 27 in OP, 36% decremental margin, frankly almost all this OP variance comes out Neptune Struers, PAC and a little bit out of Dynisco and the rest of the company was equal to do better than the prior year. Next slide. On asset velocity, the discipline continues here. You can see that our inventory plus receivables minus payables and accruals, hit a new all-time low point in the first quarter at 10% of revenue. That is down 240 basis points from two years ago. And 2007, increasingly looks a lot like 2009, it is remarkable, the similarities in the ratios in the numbers.  Next slide. On operating cash flow, you can see net earnings of $52 million and operating cash flow was $51 million , and so it is kind of a virtual 100%. We're going to do over 130 routinely on a year basis. So what happened you can see is receivables were favorable by $30 million, inventory unfavorable by three, payables unfavorable by five, because of course you are making less purchases.  Depreciation was nine and amortization was 17. Then you have 36 million of timing, John can talk more about that. We had a cash tax payment required in the first quarter of $12 million, which will be very atypical and won't repeat. We had interest payments which are accrued but had to be paid, they are only paid twice a year, that happened to hit us in the first quarter. That won't be the case in the second quarter. That was $12 million, and then of course we had the annual field bonuses that were required to be paid. So those things quickly add back to a much, much higher cash conversion. And then we had an improvement in deferred revenue which shows up as a negative here of $16 million, but is a wonderful thing to have. I can assure you that are a very good thing, not a negative. And so those things are understating the quality of our cash earnings in the first quarter. Next slide. Our balance sheet remains very strong; undrawn revolver was $473 million at the end of the quarter. The cash was $178 million. Our net debt was actually $8 million less than it was last year, and of course we invested $705 million last year. Shareholders equity $2 billion, so net debt to net cap at 34%, and we're sitting on over $650 million in cash and immediate liquidity for transactions. Next slide. Now, we're going to look at the segment level. As we go through the segment, the first is the industrial technology here. Next slide, you can see in industrial technology that we did in the quarter with these difficult organic fees down 22%, operating margins still closed out at 23.3, and EBITDA margins were 28% with gross margins at 48. We would stand those numbers up against any industrial company in the world. We had exceptional margins in our opinion on this level of sales, just incredibly great. Restructuring activity staying ahead of the curve which is little correction movements producing very good results. Now in the first quarter, if we look at the water automated meter reading and meters being timely Neptune, we had very difficult comp in Q1 on orders. People may have forgotten that in the first quarter last year we had the big African ordered which was effective, also another international order.  The collapse in the housing market has of course been beyond anybody's expectations and with us having the leading market shares in the country, that's actually had some depressing effect. And distribution channels are only buying the absolute minimum of activity. As we look forward to the second quarter, Neptune will have sequentially stronger orders in the second quarter, and we're quite assured much stronger sales in the second half of the year as we look at commitments.  In the area, material test, which is primarily Struers and Logitech, they had a very difficult Q1. The materials lab testing market was down very dramatically, more than 25% for equipment and that brought with it then a little lighter consumer sales of consumables than normal. In the second quarter, the consumables situation will come back decently because they're not just tied to new equipment spikes. And we think we will have a modest uptick in Struers in Q2 but still be difficult. The perk [ph] businesses, some people thought that they perhaps didn't perform well. They actually had very, very strong Q1 performance, they were very similar to any normalized Q1 activity, certainly performing at no difficulty at all, although orders in the quarter were a little soft. In the second quarter, orders are going to be up sequentially. We have already booked some things to give us confidence there, and we have a very interesting new product out of Roper pumps, that is kind of a proprietary thing, we can't – we are not going to disclose a lot yet but orders for that are very strong. Last in general activity, the short cycle book and ship businesses, which represent over half of this kind of activity, all looked fine on a book to bill basis with overall close to one. But the problem was the amount of orders weren't really great. And we don't see any material change in that for the second quarter.  Next slide. If we look at energy systems and controls, that was the most difficult comp here. We had very widespread end market weakness here, hard pressed to find anything that looked good, really compressor controls was about the only thing that looked good. We continue to take more cost actions. The problem on the margin here with 17.7% and 22% EBITDA is really driven by the actions we are taking effect, people with longer lead times severance obligations for us. So we know we're going to have a better – we are confident we are going to have a better second quarter margin in this area, and then it should just continue to improve.  We had very sharp in refinery and petrochem which is petroleum analyzer and then process control which is some additional elements of PAC and certainly Dynisco. Those businesses were awful. They had very, very sharp order falloff, significant customer capacity situations where people just closed for extended periods, and that didn't get us the normal consumables that would go along with the Dynisco portion of that business. In the second quarter, we don't think that the end markets are going to improve but we're confident that the margins are going to improve as these cost improvements that have a longer lag, will start to take effect. In the oil and gas arena, CCC I said was already very solid, no deterioration. It looks forwards to an extremely favorable booking environment here in the second quarter. The AMOT Roda Deaco [ph] businesses are shut off valves and Canadian activity with the oil sands was okay on a revenue basis, not okay on an orders basis. We have taken quite a bit of action there. We think that is going to struggle for the next several months. And then in the all other areas, the nuclear testing orders were light in the first quarter but we have solid commitments for the second half. We actually have a plan work schedule now, so they are going to have sort of a blowout second half of the year from recognizing sales and profitability basis. The smaller niche business is Metrix, Dynamic/Hardy, and those all did very well, no deterioration, we expect that to continue. Next slide. In the scientific and industrial imaging business, here it is really better than it looks. The quotation activity has gained quite a bit of momentum here with renewed funding for the National Institute of Health and other scientific funding in general. But we had extremely weak bookings in our rugged mobile businesses. Those businesses are very low margin but they actually cost about half of that, that organic V you see in here. So the underlying businesses are better than this looks and of course still pulling in here at 24% EBITDA margins. The medical niche businesses continue to do well. The consumables were strong. International was up dramatically in the quarter, and we have some very important new products, all of those milestones in terms of field testing were achieved, and those are going to be launched here in the second and third quarter, which are going to bolster in the second half of the year. And notably in our acquisition pipeline, we have quite a few things in this area that are pretty interesting as those types of businesses which normally would carry extremely high enterprise multiples are still high, but within the balance of rationality now. So the acquisition opportunities there are better than they have been. And secondly in the microscopy area which is primarily Gatan and micro imaging analysis piece, orders were up in the first quarter from the fourth quarter, but the hardware shipments associated with that longer lead times were weaker than they were a year ago. We have got quite a bit of increased activity as we have got our PhD and lead engineering people out in the field trying to catch up to the solution demands of people who want to get their products and solutions in and funded before the end of year because of the stimulus program. So we feel very good about sequential growth in microscopy throughout the year. On the camera side, the life sciences portion performed very well, had close to a record second quarter in some aspects of those products. Quote activity was good, but the industrial markets were mixed, generally flat. The OEM sales were a little bit better and we expect the camera activity to be sort of similar throughout the rest of the certainly the second quarter if not the year. And then generally this idea of having to get your engineers out of their respective locations out into the field has had the kind of positive effect that we expected it would, and it is good to see people reconnected with the markets and solutions. We think we will have a better second quarter in imaging but an even stronger second half of the year. Next slide. RF technology, here the core business is doing really well. The acquisitions are all accretive, they are ahead of plan. In the toll and traffic solution side, we had solid backlogs coming into the year, still have very strong backlogs, that's has helped sustain organic growth. Project activity is pretty robust, there are a lot of things on which we are quoting. As you can imagine, there could be a lot of different infrastructure plays that could be interesting over time for us.  As so second quarter, kind of more of the same, it is going to be more difficult Q2 comp because we had very high level of hardware and tag shipment in the second quarter of last year. So that could put a bit of stress on the margins and absolute revenue quarter over quarter. In the education health care systems and security, we have got terrific bids out and likely success stories that we can't really talk about because they have political sensitivity, one in a large very large school system in the Northwest, one in a very big city in the Midwest, and an important program with military. CBORD in their second quarter will have its very high seasonal quarter, so it should have its best revenue, and certainly its best cash recognition in Q2. The wireless security OEM sales were down in the quarter. Sequentially they will be better in the second quarter but they are still going to struggle on a year over year V basis. Freight matching is better than some people reported. Our get loaded integration problem program is ahead of schedule carries with very, very solid margins. We expect that our freight matching business will continue to perform well. Canada is holding up really quite well with link operations and US core performed well although it is a little more difficult market and we're very fortunate to have a wider range of products to defend the price points and we probably have some modest productivity initiatives going on in the US. But on balance, these businesses are very strong. We were able to do an important thing that we don't have time to fully talk about today. It is not overly material but we negotiated a deal with Inmarsat Satellite. That is important to ground asset tracking where we are going to contribute some assets and we're going to get multiple satellite coverage for ourselves. And a lot of acquisitions in the RF space, we're having discussions which we are addressing. Technolog is sort of well underway but ability to share the technology and synergies with people will have more of an effect on us in the second half as it has this quarter. Next slide. Here we look at the guidance update. On to 2009 guidance, Q2 DEPS we established At $0.61 to $0.65 and the reason for that is that we see orders increasing meaningfully in the second quarter over the first quarter levels, just not sure how much, that it'll come in fast enough to get the shipments caught up to that. Sales will certainly improve over the first quarter. We're looking modeling 4% negative currency headwind Q2 over the prior year and of course those numbers of $0.61 to $0.65 exclude any restructuring or future acquisitions. For the full year we took the DEPS down a dime on the entry-level of 2.60 to 2.80. I think we are pretty comfortable at the midpoint of that, could it be above that way if there was just any modest improvement in the global economy, we are certainly very well positioned to take advantage of that. Operating cash flow, we didn't provide any guidance previously, so we it in here as an initial place over that will exceed at least $325 million in operating cash flow and CapEx this year is likely to be between $25 million plus or minus. Summary points on Q1, we achieved the high end of our EPS guidance at $0.59, excluding the restructuring against the $0.55 to $0.60. We had very, very nominal cash, we've only had to spend $5.4 million of recognized costs thus far to execute the contingency plans in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. We have outperformed on the decremental margin expectations versus what we had planned substantially which is why we were able to produce this kind of income with lighter sales than we thought. The business mix of our RF and scientific medical softened what was a pretty draconian decline in industrial and energy. And cash conversion performed well when you look at the normal usage.  Next slide. Our Q1 business reviews that we had the field, we got everybody in the same room, no layers, we don't exactly what the field controllers should do, we do a creative thing where we have anonymous voting all of which is RF collected by the way and it was quite interesting to see how the presidents felt versus how their controllers felt versus how corporates felt at the beginning of our multi-day conference. And then voting at the end how we came a little closer together. I think corporate got much more comfortable and the field got a bit more conservative. On balance I think we have a good view of where we're going.  The asset light model we have certainly enabled the leadership teams to act and they did a great job. And I think what we close on is just while you look at Q1, while we wouldn't call a bottom necessarily of the global economy over here in the US portion, we are really quite comfortable that Q1 for us will be our lowest level of nominal sales and operating profit. And even at that low level, we had 49.9% gross margins adjusted to restructuring, 23% EBITDA, 17.9% operating margins and EBITA at 21.4. And we just want to remind everybody, not all EBITDA is created equal. Or EBITDA of 23% only has 1.6% of d depreciation in it and that 21.4 tends to turn out to be real cash.  So with that we will open it up to questions.
Operator:  Thank you. We will now go to our question-and-answer session portion of the call. (Operator instructions). We will take our first question from Christopher Glynn at Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer:  Thanks, good morning.
Brian Jellison:  Good morning Chris.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer:  So in the press release you mentioned that the orders and quote activity picked up in March nearly, I was just wondering if that is largely on normal seasonality or little muted seasonality relative to a normal year?
Brian Jellison:  Well, one of the things that has been odd in the last three quarters is that every quarter has started of sort of okay not spectacularly in the first month. In the second month, it has been exceptionally weak, and then in the third month, it has been pretty good, and on balanced should come out okay. We're seeing a little more sustained rhythm here since the end of February so we feel a little bit, a little bit better. March was up high single digits from the January February average across the board.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer:  Okay. And just related to normal seasonality, could you relate it to that at all?
Brian Jellison:  No. Especially not on orders. I mean orders are not a wonderful indicator in terms of activity here because we only book orders that are going to be shipped within 12 months and frequently the lead times on things that confuse the issues. So I don't know, John, if you want to add anything to that.
John Humphrey:  Yes, that's true. Actually our order rate really doesn't vary dramatically in most normal circumstances. The big surprise was a little bit with February being as weak as it was and that is why as we looked at much, we didn't just say, okay, it was up dramatically from February, so we feel great. We also kind of looked at the January February run rate and also against the last five months run rates. So we've looked at this a number of different ways and deconstructed it, and as a result do feel good that the second quarter is going to see some sequential improvement.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer:  Sounds good. Thanks.
John Humphrey:  All right.
Operator:  We will take our next question from Mike Schneider at Robert W. Baird.
Mike Schneider – Robert W. Baird & Co.:  Good morning guys.
Brian Jellison:  Good morning Mike.
Mike Schneider – Robert W. Baird & Co.:  Maybe first we can just approach Neptune, can you give us a sense of what the quoting activity is, and you mentioned it is sequentially. Are there awards still occurring at this point, or do you see municipalities still sitting on at least a bid and say collect, and things being pushed out in terms of deployment. And then also just a follow up on Chris' question about orders specifically for AMR projects. You said they are sequentially stronger, did you book something since quarter and?
Brian Jellison:  John, do you want to comment on that or?
John Humphrey:  Sure. In terms of the deployment, the deployments that have already been won, and so orders already received, are kind of rolling out as expected. I want to get to that point of course all the activity is lined up and the municipality generally has their work schedules and they are continuing to roll that out without very much change at all. Clearly the decision-making process has been slower than it was one or two years ago as many of the municipalities are going through their own sets of confusion regarding what their funding and tax basis are but also whether anything is going to be flowing from maybe a federal government level. But all of that noise in the system has made the decision-making a little bit slower. I mean we are actually not in a position to be able to talk about anything that we may have won recently. As you know, Mike, with your close contacts, those folks don't like it when theirs suppliers talk about any orders before they roll out those.
Brian Jellison:  I think what is important though just, Mike, I want to add, the investors then are saying, what is happening. When we say stronger sequentially, what is going to happen here is, we've had kind of the big trough negative is now behind us with Neptune and without revealing very strong statistics we would expect any negative Vs we have now to be contained in the high single digits to maybe 10% level of the balance of the year, because to the degree there is de-stocking in Roper it would come really from Neptune. That has clearly occurred in the distribution channel and so guys who would buy X tend to buy half of X because they can get immediate turnaround from Neptune in a matter of days. And so our ability to flex in the short run has made things a bit more sweet. We had an in-depth review of that with them and let's say that they are down substantially more than 10% in the first quarter and aren't going to be substantially down more than that for the rest of the year.
Mike Schneider – Robert W. Baird & Co.:  So there is sequentially stronger comment for Neptune specifically is related more so towards the distribution side rather than the project deployments?
Brian Jellison:  Well, normalized activity, I think what – the thing – and we certainly didn't miss it, I just think normally new housing starts don't have squat [ph] to do with this business because it is all the installed base. When you take away sort of a million new housing starts with the kind of share we have and you figure that somewhere between $50 and $100 per unit, that has been a problem. But we think that that has now finished nesting its way through the system, and so that is why we – I mean we are more than confident about Q2's improvement in Neptune.
Mike Schneider – Robert W. Baird & Co.:  Okay, thank you, and impressive performance on the margins guys. Thank you.
Brian Jellison:  Thank you.
Operator:  We will take our next question from Matt Summerville at Keybanc.
Matt Summerville – Keybanc:  Just two quick ones here is I think, Brian, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you are feeling better about the Zetec's performance in energy in the back half of 2009. I guess in the latter half of 2008, you start to see those projects pushed out, I guess, how much from a regulatory standpoint, because that would give us the confidence that they won't get pushed further into 2010?
Brian Jellison:  Yes, absolutely. And furthermore the naval activity that we have had right virtually nothing of is truly back and those commitments are usually very firm and they really give us a spike up in the second half.
Matt Summerville – Keybanc:  And then just I may have missed it if you talked about it, with PAC, Antek and Dynisco also sticking with energy, what are your sequential expectations there? I guess have you seen customer utilization rates improve and shutdowns become less in magnitude as we sit here right now?
Brian Jellison:  I would say that we haven't seen any improvement. We would be worried that you are going to – I don't think we think we're getting any order improvement although we think that we should. We've got a pretty strong challenge to our leadership team. Actually at PAC, we have brought in a new president, and he has been on board now for three or four weeks. He is a Dutch guy, speaks French, speaks German, he's just been around trying to kind of redress our focus on who we are and what we're doing. I think candidly PAC has seen some opportunities in industrial arena, try to go after them, those have produced nothing of real consequence. So we feel quite good about his breadth of experience, comes out of a large company, was running a private company in Australia, very much a global guy, exceptionally strong person that we think will do a better job than what we have had in the recent past. And so we're kind of counting on him. And we know the people there are looking forward to Jerome's [ph] expertise and activity and already have stepped up to the place somewhat. So part of it is just our own effectiveness that we think is going to be better and the fact we know our margins are going to be better. And it is not even a challenge to know that our margins are going to be better.
Matt Summerville – Keybanc:  And then just sticking with energy with CCC I guess, what have you seen in that business that is yielding the better performance relative to some of your other energy businesses, and I guess similar to your comments you made with the businesses I just asked about I guess how do you feel about the second half of the year in CCC and visibility there because that tends to be a little more project oriented?
Brian Jellison:  Yes. In CCC, we expect a very strong Q2 order flow. They have usually strong Q2 seasonality anyway. Lead times at CCC are much longer than most of our businesses, more like the tolling and traffic businesses, where you might be six months, nine months out. They have a high degree of confidence at the start of a quarter as to what they're going to do. We pretty well know that bookings in Q2 would be better than Q1. I think that everything they're doing related to the turbine control technology is attractive. On the other hand, as you get to the fourth quarter with them, we worry a bit about the power generation side of those businesses. We have got a great leader there, who has certainly done a wonderful job in getting people focused on rightsizing here if they have any challenges down the road. They are going to have a solid year, I mean close to a record Q1. So we feel okay about that.
Matt Summerville – Keybanc:  Thanks Brian.
Brian Jellison:  Yes.
Operator:  And we will go next to Alex Blanton at Ingalls & Snyder.
Alex Blanton – Ingalls & Snyder:  Hi, good morning.
Brian Jellison:  Good morning Alex.
Alex Blanton – Ingalls & Snyder:  I would like you to comment on the following observations that this recession ought to be quite good for Roper in two respects and actually the worse the section turned out to be, the better for you. One is that, it is very harmful to a lot of your competitors who aren't as well run or well financed as you are, so you should be getting a lot of share in some of your businesses. And if you could give us some examples of that, it would be useful. Secondly, the prices of the companies you want to buy should be coming down quite a bit, and could you comment on that?
Brian Jellison:  Yes, we could. We agree they should be coming down a bit. We would like to get sellers to recognize how much more they should come down. First I have to say the first quarter didn't feel as good as you described, but we do believe everything went really well. On the customer activity, you're absolutely right. We compete in a lot of small markets where usually we are the number one player. People at the trench have great difficulty. You just saw last week the merger market and Debtwire communications perhaps on Sun Capital writing their investment in Mark IV off to zero, and the potential filing of bankruptcy for all of those assets, which would include of course the Easy Pass system in New England which is currently under bid and which we are a bidder along with them. So there are several things like that that are already in the early stages and a whole lot of other things that we are aware of that are going to come to fruition. So we would agree with you that that is good.  The other thing that happened in our in-depth multi-day review with people is that because we don't have any layers here, when we talk about how our business is doing like compressor controls, it is because we are talking to Chris Krieps who runs it and his controller in the same meeting with everybody else. So there's nowhere to hide here and by the same token we are right out there with the rest of them. And what we're seeing is a lot of customer inputs about how they want to look coming out of the recession and we're hearing a lot of things around channel shifts and a lot of things around integrated nature of – if they were buying some portion, they would like to buy more of that portion going into an OEM activity, or maybe they are going to be more willing to outsource a larger portion of what they do. And coming out of the recession, I think the purchasing decisions from end-users is going to be surprisingly different than what we hear a lot of our competitors saying. So that is why we have actually increased our investment in R&D and product launches so that we don't miss the opportunities that we think we will see in 2010 and 2011.
Alex Blanton – Ingalls & Snyder:  Okay, thanks. And follow question is that, there has been some comment on the Street that perhaps your guidance is somewhat unrealistic and that you will be – there has been a speculation that you will be reducing it later on in the year as a result of economy. And related to that, you said that you're not going to say that the economy bottomed in the first quarter. When do you think the economy will start to recover in terms of when you're looking ahead at your guidance, what are you assuming about the economy, or is that even a factor? And how confident do you feel in the guidance that you're giving us for the second half?
Brian Jellison:  Well I think in terms of level of confidence at $2.70 to $2.80, looking at the sort of $2.70 midpoint, we feel quite confident about that frankly. I think the thing that is frustrating is that the stimulus program and government activity has gotten a number of people in our end markets who say, wait a minute, wait a minute, maybe we could call this something else, and it'll be treated as a shovel ready project, and I won't have to spend my budget money on that, and that has hurt our Q1 orders in ways that people wouldn't have foreseen. We have one example. I don't want to say where it is, but it is a very important project for us. It is already previously funded, but no orders are placed. And the orders will be important because the municipality and state involved is moving stuff around here, and that's been a nuisance; I'll tell you that, that has been a nuisance. Orders wouldn't have looked as weak if some of things hadn't gotten in the way.  I think we have a lot more visibility around how we think we will perform over the balance of the year than we do the general economy and I would say that we are probably more pessimistic about the general economy than a lot of people who we run into. And I think part of the reason that we took the guidance down to $2.60 to $2.80 from $2.70 was looking frankly at what everybody else was saying and looking how other people have reported and the depth of how far down their organic Vs are. We are down 10.5% and looked like the tallest midget amongst most people. So you have – we don't want to be ridiculous about that. I think people that are betting their ranch on we are going to have terrible 2009 are naïve, don't understand who we are, can't keep abreast of the fact that 36% of revenue is in RF when just two years ago was 27%. So we are a very different company and we have transformed at a pace of change that some people understand and others don't.
Alex Blanton – Ingalls & Snyder:  Okay, thank you.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to this Roper Industries' year-end financial results conference call. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer; please go ahead sir.
John Humphrey : Thank you all for joining us this afternoon, as we discuss the results of our 2008 fourth quarter and full year performance. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller.  Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes telephonic replay information for today's call. Please refer to slides to accompany the call which are available through the webcast and also on our website at www.roperind.com. If you will turn to slide two, we start with our Safe Harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during today’s call risks and uncertainties as described on this page and detailed in SEC filings. You should listen to today’s call in the context of that information.  And, now if you please turn to slide three, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, President, and Chief Executive Officer. And after his prepared remarks we will take questions from the participants.
Brian Jellison : Thank you John, here we look at kind of an outline for this afternoon. We’ll talk a bit about the fourth quarter challenge that many people faced and certainly us as well, how the 2008 year played out and what its implications are for 2009. We’ll talk a bit about the end market orientation around 2009 and what we see as risks and opportunities for us and then get into 2009 guidance and take your questions this afternoon. Next slide, the 2004 enterprise overview really I think is best thought about in terms of what was the challenge that we faced in the quarter. First we needed to stay ahead of the curve given the economic uncertainty and unprecedented volatility in the currency situation that was occurring and we’ll talk about currency a couple more times this afternoon, but currency has really very little to do with operational effectiveness but a lot to do with stated numbers. Secondly it was a great test of the nimbleness of our management and leadership culture because throughout it when you have a lot of growth entities and still have a number of growth entities you need to maintain a balance between nimbly reacting to the organic shift and still maintaining your product development and end market disciplines that we have.  We needed to assure ourselves that we restructured but in targeted areas not some kind of broad based thing without thought. We had to reset all of the issues around our supply chains, one of the great risks I think of 2009 is a lot of small suppliers falling by the way. We put a lot of energy in November into our supply chain situation and then a deep dive into our operating efficiencies and took some immediate actions and have that more that will occur here in Q1 and perhaps a few more yet in Q2. And we took a hard look at our working capital discipline because we wanted to assure ourselves we didn’t wind up with untold levels of inappropriate ratios of working capital in the form of receivables or inventory or supply chain push through. And then lastly we needed to react to some isolated shocks in specific end markets. First was really the problems around Petrochemical which of course any of you who follow that industry know its been quite severe in the fourth quarter.  And then some oil and gas refinery issues as people were shutting down and not having normalized through put in a variety of places. Third really plant shutdowns with some of our end users in the rubber and plastics arena and normally you might see a fall off in demand but not a shut off of demand for a month at a time and that required some nimbleness on our part.  And then in pretty broad based way abrupt changes to our historical Q4 patterns, normally the fourth quarter we have a lot of things that are not capital kind of fall in between standard MRO and we get a lot of year end CapEx cleanup for people that create fourth quarter demand and of course that virtually disappeared this year as everybody put a lid on that activity.  So it was a very uniquely challenging quarter. Next slide, here if you look at how we responded to that, is that we were able to immediately use the contingency plans that we had on the shelf, revisit those quickly, and execute those particularly in the energy segment with the industrial process business. And then we looked at restructuring and have a wonderful benefit here in that we look at breakeven cost structures each month in every one of our businesses and at the main part of our governance process, so that added a lot of clarity and allowed people to speed their execution quickly and avoid what otherwise would have been more downward cost pressure in the quarter.  Then we looked at targeted actions, we did not issue and across the board [inaudible] that says take some percentage of people out. Our businesses are pretty lean, they don’t have people standing around as potential contingency folks, and our guys did a wonderful job of really looking at assuring ourselves we took the targeted actions in those businesses that were critical and then revisited our next level of contingent actions depending on incoming demand. Acquisition integration was important because a major portion of what we achieved in 2008 was related to bringing in CBORD and Technolog and Horizon and our freight matching business and getting those to continue to grow and they had wonderful growth in the year which we always show as acquisition growth even though its organic for the company we acquire.  And then we had the record fourth quarter results. I think that it would have been hard to believe going into the quarter that you would have had a record fourth quarter for any fourth quarter in your history given the unique challenges we faced but we did accomplish that.  And the takeaway for us is that the contingency plan produced the expected results and that’s very refreshing.  Next slide, here if we look at the quarter numbers, you’ll see sales were up 3%, acquisitions were up 9%, organic growth down 3% and foreign currency down 3% and of course that’s not an across the board situation. Each one of our businesses faces a different level of risk around the currency.  Our orders for the quarter were flat with acquisitions up 7%, organic growth down 4% and currency dragging down 3%. EBITDA despite the restructuring cost still expanded in the quarter to 26.4%, up 30 basis points and our adjusted diluted earnings per share reached $0.80, up from our $0.73 to $0.76 guided number and not really much off of the original concept of $0.83. We had $0.02 of restructuring costs in the quarter. Operating cash flow reached an all time record, we had $129 million in the fourth quarter which was 22.4% of revenue and an amazing 179% of net earnings. For the full year of course again another all time record. The ratio is we think spectacular, 18.8% of revenue, $434 million. And we ended the year with a record amount of backlog, up 11% from last year with $590 million.  Our field people did a terrific job in the quarter to stay focused on what’s important, dig out of whatever holes they were seeing occur and executing quickly.  Next slide, if we look at the year as a whole then for 2008 we asked ourselves what did we set out to do at the beginning of the year and what did we achieve. First of all we needed to [inaudible] investment grade to assure that we could refinance our debt and create a somewhat better, more nimble capital structure and we achieved that.  Having gotten to the investment grade status we then refinanced the entire debt structure of the company ahead of the credit crisis completing that in July. We were expand gross margins and operating margins on the year. We actually improved our asset velocity and cash returns in the business to all time records.  We were able to find just world-class growth businesses and acquire those during the year investing $705 million in transactions above our normalized $3 to $4, to $500 million a year. We maintained our acquisition discipline, we would not kind of get off the track in terms of multiples that were used for investments, and of course opportunities in 2009 are going to be even less expensive. We were able to remain nimble and respond to the changes that came in the fourth quarter and lastly in almost every category you can think of about Roper whether its orders or sales or operating margin, net income, gross margin, diluted earnings per share, cash flow, all these things were all time records for the company.  Next slide, if we look at the full year income statement here you’ll see sales ramped up from $2.1 to $2.3 billion. So we were up 10% on revenue. Gross profit expanded from 50.4% to 51.5%, a 110 basis point improvement and I think what’s also unique is we had gross margin expansion in each of our four business segments. Our operating profit went up another 20 bps from 20.9% to 21.1%. Interest cost went up a bit but of course up substantially in the fourth quarter relative to the first three months of the year as the refinancing interest rates hit with the bond offering that we did.  And then our adjusted net earnings were up $290 million, 16% from the $250 million base line in 2007 which excludes just two items, the $0.02 of restructuring and the debt extinguishment cost that we took in the third quarter and announced previously. So full year DEPS would have been $3.10 against $2.68, up 16% on a sales increase of 10%.  Next slide, here we look at our asset velocity and five years ago at the end of 2003 as we really put these disciplines in place, we had at that time 13.5% of revenue tied up in inventory. At the end of this past month we were down to 8.1%, receivables you see came down 210 basis points and payables and accruals expanded so we’ve had just an enormous turnaround in the working capital required to run our businesses. We ended the year at 7.8% of inventory plus receivables minus the payables. That avoided $225 million of investment if we were still back at the old working capital ratios which is frankly, that’s more then our cash on hand so this process that we put in that we continue to work on has really made an enormous difference in the cash efficiency of our company business lines.  Next slide, something that I think we don’t always get just completely clear when we talk about our asset light business model. Here you’ll see on slide 10 if you look the INDU section of the S&P 400 industrials that group of companies takes 27% gross profit on sales. The S&P 500 companies somewhat larger at 29%, Roper’s gross profit as a function of sales is 51%. If we look at the gross fixed assets which is something we always like to remind people about, I think far too many people still forget about accumulated depreciation and what it takes to run the same operations over time. The gross fixed assets of revenue for the S&P 400s are 51%, and for the S&P 500s are 58%. Our gross fixed assets as a function of revenue is 12%. When we think about that in terms of efficiency and how one responds in a difficult economic environment that everyone faces today, and we think about how much gross profit does a standard industrial company generate against its gross fixed assets, we look at 29% on that S&P 500 number against 58% gross fixed assets and say, wow gross profits are half their fixed asset rates.  When we look at Roper, we look at that 51% against the 12% and we say, we’re 425%, eight times more efficient in the utilization of our assets.  Next slide, another key component of our asset light business philosophy is EBITDA is a function of revenue. You can see the S&P 400 industrials are running 15%, the S&P 500 at 17%, Roper at 26%. And then if you look at the conversion of that into cash on the trailing 12 months period ended 9/30 for us which is what had to be reported when we did this slide, it was 18%. Now of course its 19% at the end of the full year compared to the S&P 400 at 10% and the S&P 500 at 12%. So the result is really when you think about the fixed assets on the prior page we have high margins and low assets, here we have high returns and exceptional cash.  Next slide, that’s how we can drive this phenomenal result that you see here in operating cash flow. It drives everything we do and it permeates our thinking and governance processes. This year our net earnings you can see were $287 million, depreciation and amortization, amortization added another $69 million more then 3% to the operating income line. If we focused on EBITDA which is the continuing nature of what we do, you’d see even better margins then when you looked at the operating profit line.  For the year we generate $434 million in operating cash flow up about 26% from the prior year and if you add the last three years together we’ve created more then $1 billion of operating cash flow.  Next slide, we’re going to continue to drive great cash flow because of our business strategy. Here you can see every one of our businesses is self-funded in terms of throwing off excess cash versus having to get cash from the parent company. We also don’t have the risk of the pension plan changes you’re seeing in so many businesses when the equity markets underperform and they have to devote new cash to their pension programs. We have no pension programs in the company.  We don’t have any commercial paper risks so we don’t have to worry about daily refinancing. We have very little working capital, as you saw its down to less then 8% of revenue. And our CapEx is routinely less then 1.5% of sales so we have a lot of internal cash to reinvest to drive our own growth and protect our businesses. Next slide, here if we look at the ending balance sheet you’ll see we ended the year with $524 million in an undrawn revolver. We had $178 million of cash so our net debt was $1 billion, our net debt to cap you see at 35%, our net debt to EBITDA below 2 at 1.8%. We were able to make those changes in a year in which we actually did $705 million of acquisitions. So we think we’re particularly well positioned for our continuing acquisition program in 2009. Next slide, the larger transactions we did this year CBORD and Horizon which are now really nested together and Technolog which we did at the end of the year, UK company with [pan] European opportunities and a company that we’ll bring gradually into North America met all the criteria we have for our acquisitions. They provided substantial new growth opportunities for us and all of them are ahead of plan throughout the year and are growing organically nicely.  Next slide, CBORD which we’ve talked a little about before we went to just remind ourselves when we think about 2008 perspective, it really is a strategic growth platform for us. Its in the healthcare arena, its in the educational arena. It could be a beneficiary of some of the things that happen in the stimulus package as people build out opportunities.  Next slide, CBORD married up with Horizon gets us into a real exciting area we believe and that’s dealing with K through 12 programs. We mostly are at the university and healthcare level with CBORD, with Horizon we open up a market leading position in K through 12 processes and barely a day goes by you don’t read more about childhood obesity or nutritional management or parental involvement in what children are allowed to eat at school or cashless solutions to putting money on meal cards for people and Horizon is the leader in that area an we think it will continue to grow nicely.  The next slide, here we’re looking at Technolog, Technolog is a UK provider of network monitoring and pressure management for the utility industry. They had a record year as did both CBORD and Horizon this year. We expect them to have a record year again next year. They’ve already been meeting with [anabonics] and [sub metering] and Neptune and metering and networking and we see a lot of opportunity for forward synergies here.  Next slide, as we look at the individual segments here you can look at how we performed on a segment-by-segment basis in 2008. We had RF now 30% of the revenue of the company and continuing to grow as we’ll get more contributions from acquisitions in 2008 most of which which fell in the RF space. Up over 50% gross margins with 29% EBITDA. Industrial despite a difficult fourth quarter still finished with 30% EBITDA margins. I think its interesting when you go back and think about so what was that gross profit for the S&P 500 numbers. If I recall that the gross profit for the S&P 500 numbers, 29% and the Roper EBITDA margins in industrial are 30% so people who think we are similar to an S&P 500 industrial, they might want to go back and relook at their math.  Energy up 54% for gross margin, 27% on EBITDA and imaging which rebounded nicely in the second half, we felt good about the total as you can see here.  Next slide, industrial technology, in industrial technology we had a record year for almost every business inside the family. Neptune which had a less attractive second half still finished the year with the best performance in its history. Our pump companies all had break through performance each reaching historical highs. And our material analysis business did the same. We had double-digit growth for fluid handling companies, partly driven by oil and gas, agriculture and some mining markets.  Obviously that’s going to be a little bit more difficult for us in 2009 then it has been in the past year. All the businesses executed very well. They had a lot of cost push inflation in the first part and of course that’s now going to turn to a favorable benefit for us in the next immediate period. We had this global economic slowdown that effected a couple of businesses in the fourth quarter but to their credit, they were really on top of it and took actions in advance and have taken some more actions here in Q1. If we look down here full year industrial technology did $688 million, organically it was up 5%. In the fourth quarter it was flat despite the difficult markets and comparisons. Its orders organically in the full year were up 1% because of the fall off in the fourth quarter when we were down 9% organically. The operating margins and this again is a credit to how well our field people respond, in the fourth quarter our operating margins were virtually identical to what they were for the full year at 25.8%.  Our energy systems and controls here became kind of a two stories within one year. The first three quarters we had organic growth in excess of 6%. But in the fourth quarter we fell off about 8% primarily in two business areas, our rubber and plastic sensor technology business and our pack oil refinery [instrumentation] business. In the first three quarters we were getting growth driven primarily by channel improvements and new products that we were launching globally but then in the fourth quarter we had the headwinds with the Petrochemical and refinery markets we discussed. Down at the bottom you can see operating margins for the year, Q4 was 110 basis points less then the full year, organically sales were down 8% in the fourth quarter but up 2% for the year and orders were down 4% in the fourth quarter and down 1% for the year. Next slide, in our scientific and industrial imaging business, here we had medical platform continue to drive growth with its recurring revenue and new product launches. We had a disappointing first half of the year in the camera businesses. We took some remedial action, changed some organization structures and kind of rekindled the product management function and operating disciplines in the company. That produced substantially better margins.  You can see at the bottom, in the first half of the year we were OP margins of 19.9% and in the fourth quarter we were at 22.1% even though sales were down 2% organically in the quarter and orders were virtually flat.  In the RF arena, in technology here we had that acquisitions we discussed earlier with CBORD, Horizon, Technolog, and our freight matching business, all providing terrific cash. No difficulty as we’ve moved to integrate those within the company. They all had fascinating organic growth achieved through the year and we confident it will continue in 2009. We had substantial operating margins improvement in our TransCore project and back office operations that we call intelligent traffic system and design. And those businesses did a better job in designing and delivering technology for people who were expanding their road platforms and their kiosk utilization. We have managing margins expanding primarily with that execution that brought us up nicely. As we enter 2009 we have record backlog in the RF space and we have very solid visibility for the amount of revenue we can drive throughout the year which gives us some comfort as we established guidance. If you look at sales you can see organically that sales for the year if you exclude the Middle Eastern project were up 6%, up 2% even when you include that, order were up 11% organically, 5% if you include the Middle Eastern project.  Our operating margins expanded in the full year to 23% and in the quarter were still strong at 21.8% because Q4 is not a seasonally great quarter for us.  Next slide, here if we look at the outlook for 2009 what we see really is that we have some specific end markets in energy and industrial that we expect will face continuing economic challenges and uncertainty. We’d start there with the first half is going to be difficult in our petroleum analyzer business and oil and gas refinery. We have a good deal of European presence that [we’ve taken] there.  It takes longer to really create benefits for us because of different time lines. Secondly the material analysis business which is largely run out of Denmark has done some retrenchment and once again you wind up with some slowness in the execution savings that we see in those things but nonetheless they’re meaningful. Our industrial processor sensor and instrumentation businesses we worry about because, sometimes you have tepid demand, but when you have people closing plants and extending shutdown periods for longer times then normal its hard to know as those reopen which they will, these are process operations, just how our MRO process will move in there.  So we still worry about that in the first half somewhat. But actually the biggest problem we have is just the currency translation effect. Currency is causing most of the numerical shortfall of anything we would talk about in 2009 relative to the prior year. There is some municipal spending softness and challenges that we’re seeing in that people are waiting for the stimulus to take effect, you hear that from virtually everybody in the municipal arena.  Most people still feel pretty good about the full year but are anxious to just get a decision made no matter what it is so people can execute. The Toronto project that was, we had hoped would have been booked in the fourth quarter still hasn’t been booked because its not technically completed. That could happen momentarily. We would expect it certainly would happen within the first half of the year and would certainly mitigate any shortfall we get in municipal spending related to our water meter and networking businesses in the second half of the year.  Certainly the slowness in decision making around the solutions businesses worries us as we go into the year. We’re not really worried about landing orders but we do wonder a bit about just where they’re going to come in, what we’ll see in Q1 versus Q2 and Q3. On the other hand we’ve got great things in our favor. We have a very strong backlog at $590 million, very good visibility around what we’ll do. In the traffic side of our business we’ve got apparently quite a big in rush in the National Institute of Health Funding. We have a number of potential stimulus situations that should benefit RF and a little bit in medical.  We’ve got the acquisitions performing really ahead of plan and very confident about their growth in 2009. And that allows us, next slide, to look at the guidance profile. So for the full year from an operating cash flow we’re confident we would still exceed 130% of net income in generating operating cash flow next year.  We think full year DEPS should be somewhere between $2.70 on the low side and $3.00 on the high side and that assumes that we’d have about 4% currency headwinds so that’s currency is what’s really frustrating because the currency scenario could take $80, $90 maybe $100 million off of our stated revenue even though nothing was different in terms of unit volumes. It will have a more difficult impact in the first and second quarter by the third and fourth quarter it should largely go away.  We’re assuming it will be able to have flat organic or maybe down low single-digits as we have some things that will continue to grow and they will mitigate if not offset completely the difficulty in the energy market and in some of the industrial areas. The guidance excludes a restructuring cost, we wouldn’t expect those to be enormous. We took a $0.02 charge in the fourth quarter, probably will be a bit in the first and second quarter, I don’t think there would be any more throughout the rest of the year.  Our Q1 DEPS is at $0.55 to $0.60, I know that’s a couple of pennies less then what some people may have had. The reality is all you have to do is look at first quarter more times then not is about 20% of the total year number. If you start out with a $2.70 to $3.00 it gets you to a $0.55 to $0.60 Q1. We’re pretty comfortable with, that the number is achievable. Its still going to be very difficult first quarter with the headwinds we see both in currency and certain end markets.  And in the next slide here we look at the kind of overview, number one would be what happens with currency, huge swings in the quarter, 18% negative swing related to the pound yet the month of January has been still more volatile in both the pound and the Euro so that does make forecasting a bit more difficult.  The RF and scientific imaging businesses we think will largely mitigate the weakness we talked about in energy and industrial and we’re comfortable that we’re going to continue to be nimble in executing our cost strategies. We have a variety of new product launches all of which are on target and the growth in the acquisitions to protect our margins that we feel comfortable with.  And then lastly we certainly can use our proven acquisition capability to take advantage of opportunities in a much easier environment with lower price points.  And with that we’d like to open it up to questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird : Can you talk about Neptune and specifically what occurred there during the fourth quarter with municipal spending and some of the projects you’ve been working on also comment do you have Toronto built into your guidance for 2009 and to what degree is it built in.
Brian Jellison : In terms of Toronto the way we look at that situation is we continue to work with them. Its really, we don’t see any risk in it at all its just a variety of administrative matters. We originally it looked like might have been able to be booked in the fourth quarter or certainly the first quarter and then the speed of delivery has never been clear but we’re assuming that if it doesn’t start to deliver until the third quarter that it would not help much in the first half of the year.  But we have built in a modest amount of revenue and margin into the second half guidance. If that project picked up inertia that would help us earlier in the year then is in our current thinking, but given how slow its gone administratively we’re not assuming that we’ll see much of anything in the first half. We think its kind of a Q3 play. 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird : Can you just talk about the core Neptune projects, have you seen municipalities cease installations and upgrades in the day to day meter business and then talk about the small and mid sized projects, AMR side of the business that were being deployed, were there stalls put in place during Q4 and what have you seen thus far in January. 
Brian Jellison : We haven’t seen any real slowing in anything. The only thing that we see slowing in at Neptune would be people making decisions about deployments and waiting. I think there is this perverse situation with the stimulus package that you probably have some people holding on to see what happens. We’ve curtailed a number of things. We’ve taken some actions in Neptune to reduce costs and I’d say we’re comfortable with Neptune. I don’t think Neptune can do as well in 2009 as it did in 2008. When the housing starts, let’s say they were off 10%, we wouldn’t care but when you have the kind of fall off that you have in housing starts it might result in several hundred thousand fewer water meter sales with some networking associated because many of those are in communities that would be frankly more advanced in terms of AMR then others.  So that has to hurt us somewhat. I think we’ve got a risk of certainly being down enough that it puts a drag on what 2009 can do and its got to be made up from the rest of our businesses. But we’re not seeing any, its not a severely challenging environment but its not only an absence of growth for 2009 it will drag down the company a bit. It could put a 1% drag on the company’s organic growth for the year maybe. But I wouldn’t overly focus on Neptune. We actually had a record fourth quarter for any fourth quarter in our history and Neptune certainly wasn’t a huge part of the fourth quarter. 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird : In industrial, orders were down 9% in that segment during Q4, I’m curious if you broke apart Neptune versus the sides of the segment, were they down in equal amounts, that 9% in orders or—
Brian Jellison : I do want to make sure that everybody knows that the industrial businesses through the first nine months really did exceptionally well and they helped Neptune. Neptune wasn’t the sole driver of industrial performance. It was strong in the first half of the year, not as strong in the second. And then the turnaround in Q4 was largely driven by currency and situations that had [inaudible] with the kind of customers they have.
John Humphrey : The order rate was about the same for the non-Neptune businesses as per Neptune, kind of down in the 7% to 9% range for both groups of companies. On the revenue side actually the non-Neptune side continued to grow in the fourth quarter, in the mid single-digit range. So it continued to respond well and continue to service those customers but the order rate clearly slowed down hence the reason we’re looking at some restructuring actions there. 
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird : On the copper hedges which I presume copper and steel for that matter I presume they impact industrial tech the most, how far are you hedged and or forward bought and when do you really start to see spot prices benefit this segment. 
Brian Jellison : In terms of Neptune we won’t really get a benefit unfortunately until the second half of the year on copper. There get a fall off so you don’t have quite as much through put absorption of the tonnage and the Canadian contract which is basically locked in because of the way its negotiated not happening will preclude them from seeing the benefit in costs until the second half of the year but it will start to help us in the second half. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O’Callaghan – Barclays Capital 
Shannon O’Callaghan – Barclays Capital : Just looking at some of the things that happened in December and thinking about next year, orders are down 4% organically so the guidance assumes for next year we’re no worse then that, what things get better from here do you think. 
John Humphrey : I’m not sure we’re counting on a dramatic improvement in the economic condition. I think we understand the economy. Its not very good right now and we don’t, we’re not looking for a huge improvement in the second half. But on the other hand we do have some of our businesses with very good visibility particularly in the RF side around transportation solutions and projects that are already booked and underway as well as the rollover effect for some of the acquisitions around the CBORD and Horizon and the growth objectives that they have there.  At some point here during 2009 those will actually fall into organic growth instead of just growing against what their pro forma numbers were before we acquired them. So those I think will be positives. In our imaging segment that area is once again largely NIH funding and other types of R&D funding levels drive the ultimate end market demand there combined with new product introduction. We have some very good new products that are available and we’re excited about the opportunities there.  We do look forward to having some of those R&D monies freed up and start to flow out to the research institutes and we’ll be able to serve them accordingly. 
Shannon O’Callaghan – Barclays Capital : What about stimulus, you mentioned that a couple of times, have you assumed any benefit in your plan and aside from that, what kind of potential things are you hearing about or thinking about. 
Brian Jellison : We’ve assumed no benefit from the stimulus plan. I can assure you. Right now since people talk about it and don’t execute against it, it’s a negative. If somebody will do something about it then we’ll determine whether there’s anything really positive or not but just whatever a decision is will allow other people to go ahead and execute so that will be beneficial. Its just common sense would say that the CBORD and Horizon platform we have in the school situation could be benefited from the kind of things that some people want to put into the stimulus, so that would be beneficial.  Certainly if you got infrastructure building, first stimulus package was exceptionally tepid in terms of what’s truly going into infrastructure for roads that a lot of indications would be there’d be more available for that, if there’s more available for that then people are going to want design work that we tend to provide at a faster clip. Unfortunately these things really aren’t shovel ready, they take a longer time but we’re part of the people that would maybe get involved early in those things while people are getting ready to use the shovels later. So that could help a little bit. But I don’t think Roper is really a play one way or the other on whatever stimulus program ultimately is passed this evening or next week or any other time. But its certainly not a negative for us, its probably a modest net positive. 
Shannon O’Callaghan – Barclays Capital : Can you talk a bit about pricing, you mentioned you have raws coming down, it will take a while to benefit from that, how do you think about the pricing across your set of businesses and are you seeing any kind of pressure on that yet. 
Brian Jellison : No not at all, every single segment expanded gross margins last year. We don’t see that. We have very few standard products. Pretty much everything is built to customer order. Our businesses are largely driven by application engineering with a bit of refinement so people are generally making decisions about the value of what they’re acquiring and since you don’t really have much standard product if you will, hard to measure pricing effectiveness but a simple way is to look at whether gross margins are going down or up and they are holding steady to going up so we don’t see price as a problem. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup 
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup:  What do you think about the use of the balance sheet in this environment. I think in the past you expressed comfort with 2.5 turns on the EBITDA but maybe a flex up to 3 for the right deal, or even a bit above with the visibility to drive it back down, is that still operative in this environment or are the rating agencies such that, or internally your own concerns such that you wouldn’t really take it that far. 
Brian Jellison : We would not have any qualms going to say 2.75, it would have to be one heck of a deal to get us to go up to 3 but I would say one of the things that works in our favor, just look at the Q4 cash and the difficult period includes paying for a little restructuring and we’ll still have we think really outstanding cash so I don’t think there’s any constrain about that.  We entered the year with about $700 million in kind of powder that we would have before you’d need any new debt anyway and we’re going to throw off cash, we’re already throwing off cash, so we don’t really see a problem around that. And certainly purchase multiples are coming down and but if I were modeling, I would assume they’re likely to invest $4 or $500 million, maybe they’ll do $700 million. It really just depends, we’re going to maintain our discipline around the transactions. There are things that didn’t used to happen that are out there that we thought might happen that are really there now because you have a lot of good companies that are in distressed debt situations.  And we’re spending as much time talking to private equity types around their problems as we are talking to people about actual deals. So I don’t know how those ultimately end up but there’s some pretty attractive situations that are emerging there. 
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: Can you give us a sense on CBORD and Horizon and maybe Technolog, what was the pro forma organic growth profile of what you acquired in 2008 and, assume you maybe had some cash accretion from CBORD but did you actually have EPS dilution from those deals in 2008.
Brian Jellison : No we didn’t have any EPS dilution from anything. You might argue that while we did the $500 bond and it had a 6 5/8 coupon so that interest cost was more, if you took the Q4 interest cost on an annualized basis or something, but that’s dangerous because we draw out cash.  I think we’ve said routinely that those businesses were growing in excess of 10% organically. In fact they did grow more then that and we expect them to grow at least that much in 2009.
Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup: On the restructuring given that you’re such a cash focused company, why are you bothering calling out a few pennies of restructuring here and there. 
Brian Jellison : I’ll tell you why, because a whole lot of other people who are not paying as much attention to cash machine we have occasionally challenge us and say you’re not doing any restructuring, look at this guy, took $50 million, this guy took this, this guy took that, they’re going to take more.  Part of the reason that we include it in these slides, the awareness, please look at the gross fixed asset comparisons of these companies and what Roper is and how special it is and we’re tired of people saying why don’t you do something. We’ve done precisely the right thing at precisely the right time in the fourth quarter. We’ll do it a bit more in the first quarter and we’ll do a bit more in the second quarter depending on the kind of constraints that those businesses have. They all have their plans in place. We’ve already had a call off of what’s the last two weeks look like so that’s why. I think people want to know if we are doing restructuring, how much we’re doing and we’re trying to be transparent about it.  
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities 
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities:  You said that your restructuring could go into this current half, mostly headcount or should we expect any consolidation, what are the plans. 
Brian Jellison : Mostly headcount, I think that there are a few places that we really would be able to consolidate if we wanted to. But if end markets were to continue to deteriorate in the industrial arena there might be a couple of things that we could consider. We might have one division in-source in other divisions work and back away from the assembly that that division did. That’s certainly in our contingency planning. Its not warranted yet but if you had a deeper dive and fall off in demand, those are the kind of things that we have available to do if it made sense. 
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: You spoke a lot about the translational impact of currency and what you’re expecting in 2009, have you seen any impact from the transactional impact of the stronger dollar?
Brian Jellison : No, honestly and its what’s difficult for us, we’re very well matched on a global basis and so if the stated currency is down 4% on $2.3 billion, that’s $92 million and it’ll deleverage at the same rate as though it was an operating number. It doesn’t have a decrimental deleveraging effect that deals with absorption issues and contribution margins, it delevers at the same ratio so if its down 20 or 25% because that’s the kind of business it is, that’s how it shows up.  So you could have the same level of efficiency and effectiveness and it could have as much as a $0.20 drain on our earnings per share in 2009 purely from currency having nothing to do with end markets. So we expect it in 2009 as we went through the fourth quarter that RF and some turnaround benefits we’re getting and the medical and scientific imaging would be able to offset industrial and energy and then the depth of what happened in the industrial sensor business and the refining business made us worry to the point where we said, well you know we think it should largely mitigate it if we’re lucky it will actually offset it.  But maybe we’ll have low single-digit negative organic growth because of the depth of the industrial and energy end market challenges. And then that left us open to an exposure only related to currency translation.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: You mentioned the decision making, the slowness on the part of your customers, how would you characterize the existing business in terms of are we seeing a significant number of customer delays, any cancellations, are your customers revisiting price. 
Brian Jellison : We have sort of stepped up, we put a number of new call systems in place where we’re involved very frequently. The activity that our divisions have and their quotation indices and everything else is not [inaudible]. The activity level is as good as it was before but the commitments are slower and so we remain cautious because our fear would be that its just going to take a longer time for people to commit and that’s what worries us.  We’re not seeing any cancellations, we’re not seeing price difficulties. 
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: The hit that you took in the second quarter of 2008 on Neptune relative to the repair cost to the vendor’s components, have you received any of that $3.5 million back yet, can you give us an update on that.
John Humphrey : First as far as the reserve that we took, we’ve spent about 85 or 90% of that so we’re almost completely complete with that repair and fix activity. As far as the vendor and the negotiations, no we have not received any of that yet. We have come to a framework for a, come to an agreement in principal with the supplier that will result in slightly lower prices over the next two to three years or so that will just run through as lower cost of goods sold for the Neptune business. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville - Keybanc 
Matt Summerville - Keybanc:  On the imaging business in the fourth quarter I think your operating margins were 22% which is the best performance that segment has had in a couple of years, first can you talk about how much of that is mix related and how sustainable is that if you think your medical and life sciences businesses will on a relative basis at least outperform in 2009.
Brian Jellison : Part of it is they’re growing faster then the others so there is a natural mix gain you get with that. We had really, from the first part of the year what happened is a couple of businesses had arrangements with customers, they had made some expensive investments in specific R&D without getting the right kind of assurances and the customers didn’t follow through in the timelines that they thought they would and so it depressed margins because you had no revenue matching up against the R&D costs.  And it wasn’t billable in any way so we have taken some actions in those businesses around restructuring which we never really even talked about, they’re just all done and we made some management changes and have done things all of which are beneficial. We got some new leadership that’s doing a better job. We’ve got better focus. In the first part of the year there was a concept called Mag and people trying to put some things together and we didn’t think that was in the best interest of things and unfortunately we were proven right and so we had wound that.  Now you’ve got the focus back and things look better and the business could do better in 2009 especially with this NIH funding initiative that people are talking about. And then the challenge would be if the industrial side was worse. I mean those businesses, the industrial camera stuff, a lot of that is used in flat panel inspection and that business is on its worst possible legs and so the rest of it has to offset that and we think it will.
Matt Summerville - Keybanc: On energy, I think you talked about in the third quarter seeing some pretty meaningful push out with [Vteck] what the timing of that’s going to look like if you saw any of that in the fourth quarter whether that’s 2009 and just more broadly on energy, you tend to talk about things around safety environmental regulation, productivity improvement really driving the business, outside some of the macro things going on, I’m trying to get a sense for how much of your energy business do you feel is really well insulated from the macro cross currents right now. 
John Humphrey : Around Vteck, you’re right the push outs happened in the third quarter and we didn’t really expect them in the fourth quarter and they should hit sometime in the first half of 2009. We have largely been insulated and really haven’t had very much correlation to what the overall oil price has been. But on the other hand the end markets that are served by particularly around refinery and petrochemical for them its not around whether they want to invest in new productivity solutions or compliance with regulations, those folks just shut their plants down.  And as a result they weren’t buying anything and so what normally would have been a very strong fourth quarter and historically has been a very strong fourth quarter for some of those businesses as folks flushed out their annual operating budget not only did they not flush out their operating budget, they didn’t even do their normal level of activity. So I think once folks get back to actually running their plants, then they’ll start looking at ways to either become more efficient or to comply with whatever regulations that may be out there.  We have some activity underway with some of the regulatory bodies in California that could have some very good tailwinds but that probably won’t happen until 2010 or beyond but there’s good conversations there. 
Operator: There are no additional questions at this time; I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing comments. 
John Humphrey : Thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you as we finish the first quarter in a couple of months.

Operator: Good day everyone. And welcome to this Roper Industries' Third Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to John Humphrey, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead sir.
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Lea and thank you all for joining us this morning, for Roper Industries' third quarter, 2008 conference call. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our third quarter results. It is available on our website www.roperind.com. The press release also includes telephonic replay information for today's call. Please refer to slides to accompany the call which are available through the webcast and also on our website, so you can download those at your leisure. If you will turn to slide two, you will once again see our Safe Harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking-statements today and you should review those and listen to those statements in light of the risks and uncertainties that are detailed on this page, as well as the specific risks and uncertainties that are discussed in our 10-K and other SEC filings. And, now if you please turn to slide three, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, President and Chief Executive Officer. And after his prepared remarks we will take questions from the participants. Brian?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, John. Good morning everyone, perhaps may need, we've fortunately and hopefully prepared the content here in a way that will help you think about how we're doing and where we're going and what the... this kind of volatile world is. So if we start at the beginning, we look at the third quarter of 2008 review. We'll have a comment or two about how the overall enterprise is doing and then we want to spend a dedicated amount of time here about cash awareness with the company and our debt structure. And then we'll talk a bit about third quarter results and review each one of the segments, all of which had something good happening in the quarter and we'll again we believe this fourth quarter and then update you on the guidance and take your questions. So next slide, on the enterprise overview you can see sales in the quarter were up 11% internal growth was actually 6% if you adjust for the Middle East project of last year, you'll see we get to our half out how spectacular that actually is in terms of what the growth was excluding the project, which really talks about the underline health of what we're doing. Reported growth of course was 5% with 1% currency and 4% organic. Orders in the quarter were up 9% internal growth was up 5% again if you exclude the take through the pipeline with the Middle Eastern project. Gross margins were up a 110 basis points to 521 demonstrating once again that we have the benefit of pricing power, we have the capability in continuing to drive value at customers and just don't have that kind of price pressures that so many other firms face day in and day out, because they don't have the solution and they don't have respectable products. They don't have that kind of customer service and application engineering capabilities we do annually everyday. Operating margins were up with 22.3% of 100 basis points or just something that we are very proud of how well we are operating people performed in the third quarter. Our net earnings were up 19% to $77 million when you exclude the debt extinguishment charge we indicated we will be taking in the third quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $0.82 versus $0.70 last year again excluding the charge which was $0.02. And operating cash flow we'll talk more about that later was up 51% to a $138 million in the quarter which represented 23.3% of revenue and if you divide that 138 by the 75 million reported earnings we're up a 184% on the cash conclusion factor. If you turn to the next slide, we would see the strong balance sheet here. Our cash at the end of the third quarter was $156 million, net debt $1.190 billion and you can see that the net debt the cap and trailing 12 months EBITDA I think supporting here $587 million versus the same point a year ago trailing EBITDA would have been $502 million. Our net debt to EBITDA even after all the acquisitions we'd have been done this year, we sit here at that basically two times net debt to EBITDA and 12 times interest coverage. So, we have very strong investment grade metrics by having investments of $700 million this year, and sitting on the ability to spend another 600 million at will. Next slide; Roper cash awareness what's really important, I think when you look at what's happened to that credit issues around the world and the problems that people are going to face is that fundamentally all of our businesses are self funded. We really don't need any external input to drive those businesses. They throw up more cash even in any kind of downturn then they require to run. So, second thing is when you look at people who are going to have very difficult times with their pension plan adjustments suddenly requiring more inputs, you want to note Roper does not have a pension plan. We only have 401(k) plans which are basically self-funded so we don't have the equity market risk of having to make cash inputs into pension. Thirdly, we don't have any commercial paper program, out of some confusion apparently in the quarter about short-term debt at Roper end, and the reality is we have no pressures on debt at any kind. Fourthly, we really strategically refinanced the company, in the moment I will give you the detail around that and we got that done in July. So, that it really didn't affect us as things un-ramped. We've got $600 million of cash and un-drawn debt capacity in place as we talk here today and we're going to continue to be able to build cash in the fourth quarter and beyond because of the quality of the business. We have very low working capital; you'll see a statistic today that's really unbelievable where we've able to cut our working capital in hand over a very short period of time. Our CapEx the sales is less than 1.5% and in fact, year-to-date our operating cash flow is about $306 million and our CapEx year-to-date is about $20 million. And we don't expect it to exceed 30 million and we've already increased our operating cash flow for the year to $410 million or more. But you've 410 to last 30 looks like $380 million of operating... count free cash for us in that definition. And, our metrics on free cash flow is going to continue to improve because the cash driven business model we have is really perfectly suited to capture the opportunities that are immediately in front of us and are likely to stay in front of us for the next several months. Next slide, here if we look at our debt structure you can see we have a $500 million bond with a 2013 maturity date it has a coupon rate of 6% and 58% [ph]. And the second part of our debt structure is, we have another term loan, which is a $350 million term loan that's due in July of 2010 and that cost basis on that is LIBOR plus a 150 basis points. And then, we have a $230 million senior subordinated convertible note which is kept even though the maturity is 2034 with accounting rules where it continues to show up as a short term debt item. And that's what confuses some people, if that note were called by us, or called by the convertible people. We would have cash capability to take care of that at any cost. That's a rate of 3.75% and it goes to a zero coupon in January. Then we have a $750 million revolving line of credit if we put in place and that's good through July of 2013, that is it LIBOR plus a 130 basis points and I think at end of the quarter we had drawn $259 million against that $750 million. So, this structure gives us substantial flexibility, it reduced the risk around any issues and because we self generate cash to run the business, we have a lot of flexibility about how to use our forward cash. Next number; here we're just at the third quarter results. Next slide; the income statement as you can see net sales were $593 million in the quarter up 11%, 6% external if you exclude the Mid East 4% if you don't. The gross profit margin expanded from 51% in third quarter of '07 to $521 income from operations was up 16% with sales up 11. Operating margins we setup 100 basis points. Net earnings adjusted for the debt extinguishment were up 19% again favorable leverage sales up 11% income from offset 16% net income 19%. Next Slide, if you'll look at the EBITDA growth which is just, what when you look to how the markets thinking is its amazing, but if you go back to the third quarter, just two years ago, our trailing EBITDA was $398 million and two years ago to date, the stock on October 24th closed at 4787 with $398 million. Here we are today, closing the quarter with $587 billion of EBITDA and we'll see where the stock closes. It is truly a remarkable thought. If you look at margin expansion, you can see here in a 12 months period for October 3, '06 our trialing 12 months EBITDA margins were 24.5%. They rose in the next 12 month forward period to 25% and now have risen still again in this next period to 25.6%. We're confident about growth going forward. We think we can hold on to these margins, we just don't see the risk that other people are fearful of. Next slide; on asset velocity, this is a slide we would put up on every other slide if you would tolerate it. Let's take a look at what happened now. If you have a company, those of you invested in us own a company who only need 6.5% of revenue. In this quarter, our net working capital generated sale. This is a remarkable performance. You can see inventory in just two years has dropped from 9.3% of sales to 8.6% and now to 8%. Payables and accruals are up from 39 to 17.6 because we are benefiting from differed revenue and these businesses that we required where customers pay us in advance to provide their work over the course of the year. And this is not just a bubble where we brought from 13% net working capital which would be very good compared to any of these people that people think they're in the diversified industrial category. The 12% last year to 6.5, we will certainly end the year with less than 10% of networking capitals of the sales I think we won't have trouble running the company at levels at that we were below in the future. Next slide; focusing on cash, our Q3 operating cash flow was a $138 million. Year-to-date we're at $306 million as I indicated and we've raised guidance to $410 million for the full year. Very good execution across the businesses on all these working capital initiatives we've put in and then two things that particularly helped in the quarter. This is the quarter that we get the big seasonal benefit out of Seaboard who is basically providing annual subscriptions for people who pay us in advance for the entire year and much of that money comes in here in the third quarter. Secondly, we've gotten substantial payments out of our project piece in intelligent traffic systems and designs. Those two things have helped but it's widespread throughout the company and you can see our operating cash flow was up 51% over the corresponding quarter or a year ago. Next, we got the segments, sorry next slide and you look here at our performance by segment. You'll see a nice rebounded imaging because the imaging margin is back, let's will talk about that. 24% EBITDA and 54% gross margins are still lowest of our family businesses, but it's also only 16% of revenue. Energy all made at 27%, industrial with 30 with a 49% gross margin, lot of industrial companies have got gross margins that are like 38%, we've got an EBITDA margins that's 30. And our RF business is at 31% really just outstanding performance an intelligent power of the acquisitions we've made this year with our additional freight matching business Horizon and Seaboard earlier in the year and now Technolog, these are just beyond real past business. Next slide; scientific and industrial imaging, here you can see sales were up 4% as reported orders up 8%. Organically the internal numbers you can see little better than that, so the orders were 10% most importantly and what we were upset about in the conference call in the second quarter was margin erosion and imaging which we found unacceptable and we've done a number of things about that and you can see we've already corrected much of that problems as it was up a 190 basis points in this quarter. The medical business had a very strong Q3 and continues that kind of run rate we think in Q4. We had additional field operating reviews for the camera businesses. John and my self and others attended those kind of workup programs you'd all be familiar with, and I think we've gotten a much better focus on what the economic requirements are for people. We are very impressed by the quality of the field operating people. It just reminds us how good they truly are that we've just had a leadership crisis between the people who still the work in the field and some of the P&L management that though was not paying attention to what was important and causing confusion and ambiguity and that's no longer there. The camera business as we brought all the product managers together talked about long-term strategy, we're very encouraged about their motivation and their commitment to continue to drive growth and really ended the quarter feeling pretty good about the direction to the point where we think, with the margin expansion and some pricing opportunities that we're going to capitalize on that we are available to maintain these kind of ratios in the fourth quarter and to have imaging back on track. Next slide; here we look at the energy systems and controls business. It had an interesting Q3, sales are up by 5%, orders were down 7% and organically they were down 9%. Most of that really is tied to our situation in Z-Tech where the nuclear work that would normally get done has been pushed out and initially pushed out to Q4 really now pushed out to the beginning of the year. Some of that is currency related where people are surprised at their relative currency erosion at the expense of a dollar and we're hoping that maybe that would turn around and their cost and their work will go down. So that's probably the one think in the quarter that we really were surprised by and because of it, it's the leading reason why we just didn't feel we could lead the high-end of our guidance out there because we can't predict when this the foreign business that we have in nuclear is likely to release the work but they do have to release it they can't sit on it, they're just a matter of when it comes. Control system sensors and the protective technology business grew more than double-digits in the quarter and remains a very healthy. We had a disappointing quarter around analyze our sales to North American refineries and what we can't tell us how much of that is the interruption from hurricane Ike. In our own case we have four divisions headquartered in Houston that relates to the energy business and they had basically about a 10 day pietas where most of our workers were able to get in. We didn't have power for part of the time, we had all of our back up plans kicked in place, we had different group of businesses issuing, invoices and doing work and recurring customer service calls that field team did a wonderful job and is very hard to know how much of sort of sluggish orders out of the North American refinery business is due to any real change in activity and how much is that the kind of things they are buying for us which tend to be not capital expenditures, just kind of fall down in the order of priority and then certainly we've experienced some supply chain interruptions from people and we've been trying to get their businesses back on line and have the believe that most customers are a little bit behind. Certainly not an excuse, it's just a recognition of what was going on there. Based on already what we're seeing and the commitments out of our different operating divisions, we would expect the fourth quarter to be sharply higher than the third quarter. I and hope at least this is good it was last year, which was a terrific quarter. So, on balance we think this was kind of a temporary aberration you are seeing. But, even given that we produced, 23.7% of operating margins. Next; in industrial technology, on the balance, these businesses are doing exceptionally well. You can see here orders were up about 7% and sales were up 4%. Internally orders were also upset and because there is no acquisitions in this segment. We have double digit growth again in our material test business, they continue to export well. A very strong orders in our fluid handling business Cornell Roper, doing really well in the agricultural and the extraction area in oil and gas markets, pretty substantial backlogs in these businesses they are really performing so well along with the test the businesses that we have in industrial that Neptune had a completely flat third quarter and yet you can see our orders were up 7% and sales were up 4% with Neptune being flat. And, the good news of course about Neptune is we have turn out project on pack which will help us in the beginning of 2009. Our business execution plans, we went through all of that for these people we looked to their contingent situations, they are continuing to grow the cost problems that have are solid. You didn't really have basically flat margins, but let's look at those margins of 25.9%. So, we are in good shape there and we really see the business order continue to be have steady activity at Neptune and the rest continue to do organic growth. Next slide; on the RF technology segment it would be safe to say, this is a blow out quarter, sales were up 29% of course we buy in these terrific acquisitions, orders up 29, operating margins up 270 basis points to 26.2%. Internally, if you exclude the Mid East project our sales were up 11 more importantly the orders were up 17% internally without that project and it's in the baseline. With it, we were still up double-digits in order of percent. It was a terrific performance out of totaling in service of the side of intelligent traffic systems, lots of activity in the Mid East project and then substantial shipments into Florida as they're switching over more to the eGo tag and more protocol readers that we are going to list. The Seaboard company benefits from this Q3 subscription process that we have and certainly helped our cash as we mentioned as it comes in a good margins, that... operating quality business sustained throughout the year, but in cash infusion tends to come seasonally here in the third quarter. We expect our RF to have another very strong quarter in a fourth quarter we don't really see grow any slack of any kind there, and then we will talk a bit about the last two of the three acquisitions we did in the quarter, in our Q2 call we went over the freight matching business, that we acquired that's nicely with our business Portland Oregon. And, then this quarter we have acquired Horizon and Technolog. So next slide; our Technolog is fascinating UK based company. There you have basically GSM technology where sounds are used to communicate, and Technolog is the leading provider of network monitoring in the UK and increasingly is finding opportunities on the contents. There they have more sophisticated program around pressure management or water pressure, gas pressure and they have smart metering solutions they go-to-go for water and energy utilities in the UK. They have the terrific leadership team their products are generally patented the AMR solutions they are providing good all different forms of metering process is not just water only and they have an installed base of over 250,000 points in their network in Europe. They have their own field service people with doing trucks service in meter reading for people and provided they daily management. It's a more commercial type of activity than its residential we have in the stage. But, because they do such a good job with software and firmware and have a lot of deal management capability, they are going to help our Neptune business substantially we believe in future. Next slide; if we look at Technolog its got a terrific track record over the years of growing sales and profitability on a consistent basis certainly a double-digit revenue grower, business model tips were over like a globe. The people there, you would think they were lifers with us. I mean there is much like us, since we are and we're really proud to have them join the Roper family, because they are wonderful people, they have great clients very stable, very loyal customers Next; Horizon software is fascinating company again with solid growth and to the business that really provides casuals, data collection and software solutions for the inter-garden through 12 launch programs. Those of you who have kids that maybe in one of these programs like liner balance close out their Los Angeles most recent big win here. There are a lot of things that are going on around nutrition management for kids, parental involvement making sure that they don't have cash in their pockets with all the difficulties that can occur the opportunity to see what the child actually spend for lunch, there is control processes that can say these are the fine kind of things that can purchased. There are mandated reporting requirements to differentiate between kids and various meal government programs that might get a couple of dollars of reimbursement for the government versus others who get maybe 60% still others who get, sorry, $0.60, and other who get $0.30. There is parents who want to add to their card, they can view that in a through to software that's provided. There are some real compelling public information you can see in the lower right hand portion here, just some of the staff, Good Morning America, where the team was interviewed and talk about why this is such a big opportunity in the future. Are they prepay online, it's enormously valuable to not have children walking around with cash for reasons we can all understand. And you see vending machines, it appear we entered into an arrangement of people who are going to be able to make the vending machines cashless, where they can use the school lunch program part to access and control that kind of machine they can access. And that's really exiting for everybody involved. It's a very compelling business model, it's got long-term occurring revenue just like Seaboard as we bring on board things you can see that point of sale register, it's a different kind of price point and technology using our software than what our point of sale of technology is. Seaboard, so that gives us kind of nice range of things. Horizon has some military work, and it's bidding on more military work that we think we are interested and we have our local mobile people working with them on, how that you design that and control it. They have a 98% customer retention rate, which is terrific, and again lots of recurring business and then steady upside there. Next slide; here if you look our guidance update. Next slide; what we've done is, last year we earned 268, and what we said we think the full year looks like is probably 315 to 316 basically renewed the high end of the guidance and dropped $0.03 of the low end. And that's really driven by the higher interest cost to fix in 58, coupon on the bond, coupled with a little bit high LIBOR. Maybe, it won't be that bad in the quarter. And then, we just didn't feel with Z-Tech push out that we will have to get to the high end of the range of four, the 316 is certainly an attainable number, if you look at our future acquisitions that are included here and the debt extinguishment charge, I think all of this is pretty clear and I think in a sort of equally importantly is that we are increasing our operating cash flow from 390 to 410 so $20 million more cash flow is real cash versus the kind of GAAP based debts reporting that has nothing to do with cash. Next slide; what's different in 2001 and 2002? Well, everything is different. Look here at who we are today versus who we were back in 2001 heading into the slowdown in business activity that occurred in that cycle of 2002. Today, our investment create balance sheet then we had no publicly traded debt, we were not rated, we were in insurance debt. We ended the calendar year, or the... sorry the fiscal year of 10/31/01 with $16 million of cash. At the end of the third quarter now we have a $156 million of cash, a tenfold improvement. We had the capacity to draw against debt but the covenants would have precluded it really occurring to borrow $94 million. Today, we have un-drawn capacity of $438 million. We have six times the financial capacity today that we did going into the recessionary cycle in '02. Secondly, our business is our asset like, they generate more cash than they required, very different than some of the businesses that we were depended on back in 2001. Our business is throughout of high gross margins that are really generated from the applications we provide rather than some special arrangement with gas firm. We are no longer defendant on either gas firm or the semiconductor capital spending. In fact, neither is rounding here in our results. We have a diverse international business with broad global reach, last year it was up around 40% of total portfolio, it continues to expand as to our domestic business we look for opportunities outside United States. We have long term contracts in place with renewals and subscriptions in recurring revenue. We have virtually none of that in 2001. We have secular growth businesses and applications that dominate the company today; we're basically fundamentally a different and stronger enterprise now than we were there. Next slide; we have a family of secular growth businesses. Back in '03, we added water metering and usage information to the portfolio. In '04 we added radio frequency identification technology applications and solutions. Then we added sensors and warning indicators emergency shutoff systems in a variety of smaller acquisitions in one large group. Then we added high margin medical products and consumables and I continued to build out that platform. And more recently we've been addition multiple software and communication applications. We have freight matching and logistic software, we have wireless security technology, we have utility network data collection monitoring and communication processes. We have a variety of integrated systems now for campus and our healthcare community settings that enable locations transaction security administrative process. Again remaining at we are fundamentally different and stronger enterprise and with that I would like to open it up for questions.
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Lea, Can you start the Q&A portion of the call? Question And Answer
Operator: Absolutely. We will now take our question and answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Alexander Blanton with Ingalls & Snyder.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning to Alex.
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Little bit since you started talking Brain. I think you've done a good job of telling us about the some other cyclical parts of the business particularly the energy part and compressive control. And, clearly this is a minor part of the business compared with growth businesses, but what the market is concerned about investors, shareholders in Roper and so on is what is going to happen in 2009 to the global economy and to these cyclical parts which you do have some. And I am thinking of for example compressor controls projects in the energy area where you are providing systems that there maybe push outs or even some cancellations in some of those. So, and some of the other industrial type products, so in your judgment looking at 2009 what's going to be the balance between things that are exposed to the economy and the growth parts. Are a growth parts which you get, did a good job of enumerating. Are they going into more than offset any possible equivalent item to the smaller cyclical parts in 2009 and enable your earnings to continue to grow despite what looks like a very... much worse and expected global economy?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well. I obviously a great question Alex and I know it's on everybody's mind.
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Are you speaking into the microphone?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I'll say it hopefully we are on. I said it's a great question I know and certainly on everyone's mind, we haven't really released any 2009 forward-looking guidance, we just talked about the quarter, I would certainly say that we don't expect the company to go backwards, as we look at some of things people have written suggesting that we earn less money in '09 and for earning in '08, we're how to strained about that kind of concept but this is good, it is very hard to predict how much growth we'll have in next year. But the incoming plans that we have into the field there are all do this weekend for '09 '10 '11, we start our planning reviews on Monday with the industrial businesses. So, we haven't had that, that's going to take as; frankly we have about a six week in depth their process we have to meet every management team and go through a variety of things. But none of our teams are... I mean they are not arrogant; they are not saying, we are going to refuse to participate in recession that your hear people saying. But basically, better businesses win whether there are good times or bad and our businesses are they are pretty solid, so I think they feel pretty confident. I think that they are concerned about how much growth will be there. We look at the last two quarters with 4% recorded organic growth. If you strip out the Mid East project, we actually had 6% growth in both those quarters. We have 7% growth in the first quarter, then last year in December we had a kind of a big investor meeting or some one individual is pushing me about if there is a no growth environment, can Roper grow, and we answer that question last year yes. I think most people with believe we didn't have any growth in the third quarter and when it all comes in but, Roper grew with 4% organically or 6% adjusted. So, we're certainly all over the different pressures we have I think that's, that the things that we're worried about aren't cyclical things, we're worried about what's going to happen with municipal spending and what's going to happen with the general economy and what effect that has. But, we are very blessed to have an important backlog of over $600 million and the backlogs we reported only those that are shippable within 12 months, they're much deeper than that. So, I wouldn't say we're fearful, we're just confident about where we are and we're comfortable about our ability to do things. I think that if you do have a follow up in organic revenue, there are a lot of other things that come with that, we'll be able to do some things that could lower our debt cost, we'll able to use our cash in ways that will have a really favorable leverage going forward. So, we're just trying to be pragmatic I mean, we debated we could have not changed our Q4 guidance in anyway. But, I think that's crazy because if we would have expected that Koreans or the French were going to oppose post ups because they didn't want to have to pay their dollar denominated contracts. So, those things are forces in the world marketplace that everybody is going to be confronted with. We just think we're better prepared in more nimble to deal with whatever happens than most people are.
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Yes. Well by the way, Brian who are these people who are riding these things? I'm just looking at all the estimates, and everything we wanted them is for growth next year, everyone who has published an estimate on the sale side. So, I haven't seen anyone suggesting you would have down earnings as yet.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: They're out there.
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Okay. The other question I want to ask is that in this environment, don't you see a prices of potential acquisitions coming down as some of the financial buyers run into problems. Isn't it more favorable environment for you in terms of making acquisitions and also typically in a recession, weaker competitors drop out, stronger companies gain market share, so don't you think that will happen?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I do think that will happen it's already happening. We, generally when we do transactions, we might have been involved in them for four months or six months or it maybe things that we started in one year and for whatever reason, the occurrence or later because of owners, today you have a crash of private sellers who're concerned about potential changes to their capital against tax who are frantically calling us and then you have other people who need to liquidate for cash purposes whatever they are. Certainly private equity has great difficulty in getting the kind of leverage that they'd like to have to do deals. I think until a month ago, we remained disappointed about many people who just couldn't accept the multiple collapse. But, when you tell people I don't know who, what you're thinking but if you think I am paying you large a remittable for your private company, then we're getting paid by our investors publicly then you're pretty stupid. And that'll increasingly be in apparent. What we end in plus there is this all these public companies that continue to go down and down and down and in our ability to be nimble and flexible around the variety of things that are available, we've never had such a good situation looking forward.
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Okay. And what about the market share gains?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well the market share gains, we're pretty dominant in our markets frankly. So I mean when you look at something like compressor control, we're in really relationships are with big players and we might gain a bit of market share a bit, our market share is pretty solid. We want to make sure is that, we keep our working capital low that we don't have any inventory exposures, we don't have anything to building negatively in there, that we keep our pricing where it needs to be for people and we maintain our long term relationships. It gives us an opportunity if there is less customer activity in any short term period, it means our sales people and our marketing people will be able to develop more long term relationships that they should get any kind of turn around, we capitalize on equipment and we feel pretty good about that.
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Schneider with Robert W. Baird.
Michael A. Schneider - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Can we first address Neptune. I'm curious as to what you've seen in the quarter, you explained the flat performance we've heard out of bad over that there has been project cancellations, project delays if you can just address, what's happened in your project activity and then just in your day-to-day and role activity?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well with Neptune we haven't really had any cancellations haven't really seen any...had a couple of discussions with them in the last week they were important to our specification contradicts out sort of pay in. I think that we would hoped that Toronto project would have come in maybe to be are able to be booked and maybe have some shipments in Q4 and it looks like... I don't know, we might been have thought, but it probably won't shift till January. We've had a natural run, the reason they're flat in Q3 is that we had really difficult cost for Q3 a year ago, as we were finishing out North Carolina and some of the places in Florida. And, so, it's not really a surprise to us. I think the surprise for people just to digest for a second Mike, is that, look at the growth we had in industrial would with Neptune flat. Most people think industrial was only Neptune, and they are dead wrong, we still have our great core businesses there. So, I think we're cautious about the forward-looking activity because of municipal spending and people being concerned about what's happening. I think that's... we don't think business is going to go down. But I think that's a wild part of that, how much of growth we can get out of Neptune. On the other hand, we already could have placed in our cost actions that are really good, Neptune, and we continue to reduce the cost there in terms of material and how we're doing labor in added processes to the electronic components of Neptune. So, it had a very solid quarter, but it was just flat on incoming orders and we would guess it's kind of flat in '04. But there is no push offs sort of anything else that are over that we've seen.
Michael A. Schneider - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So to be clear, Neptune didn't miss your internal budget for Q3?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: No, I don't think so. No.
Michael A. Schneider - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And, I am sorry like?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: They were within 1% of whatever, we will look in that. We have, I mean they...
Michael A. Schneider - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes.I am sorry later collect the brand and orders during Q3 were flat as well in Neptune?
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Actually, orders were down slightly, but within the margin of area that's for sure, a low single-digit, very low single-digit.
Michael A. Schneider - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then stores, can you just that permit because that must be the driver in industrial and in punctuates your point about this morning industrial of the Neptune, how was that business being German-based and industrial based able to grow double digits in this market?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, couple of things; stores is not the only business here, but... what happens with stores in our Denmark based company, they are in Copenhagen. And we have significant presence in sales and in market presence around the globe and we have an operation in Cleveland and we have another one in Asia for terms of selling. But that business does well in any kind of environment like this where people are focused on cost reduction, and material substitution. And, we have our whole family physical property database; people want to buy from it. So, few years ago we took our media cybernetic software into their with IQ studio. So, there is just a solution set and a wonderful customer service organization and engineering capability there that encourages people who want to continue to use stores and they do. Yes, that's big, but don't underestimate how well Cornell and our and Roper pump are doing. I mean, these guys are continue to do very well we've got in Cornell refocused on the agricultural market, we've got Roper refocused on a variety of new products, its definitely taking share at the expense of other people and ARBOL has a very nice group because people are looking at using slurry pumps and water for a variety of things beyond municipal applications and ARBOL [ph] is a leader in that area when you look at track. So, they're all doing well, and really the programs that we put in place around recurring revenue and not letting parts of pirates get your business and staying close to people post close and extending warranties for long term contracts are all paying dividends for that.
Michael A. Schneider - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And,Brian I think final question just another area in this conception among investors and analyst is the sensitivity of TranScore and the freight managing businesses to what's going on with fuel prices miles driven etcetera. Can you just address for us how you plan and anticipate the fact that municipal budgets are headed lower miles driven are down again for the second consecutive year, just vis-à-vis TranScore and the freight managing business?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I think John just talked in, recently you may want to comment but the reality is as we that it's kind of an oligopoly and we're down to two players. The importance of the acquisition we made in July coupled with what we do with our core business out of Portland, Oregon is very helpful for us. There is lot of synergies that we have, that we're able to execute against. We have a much broader range of price points now so that people can subscribe at lower cost points on some of the areas and different levels of service. Business continues to perform better than it has. I think some people would say that miles driven have something to do with that but they just don't that is not an indicator, might be an indicator about the tolling revenue that authorities collect. But our request for quotations design around tolling applications continues at an all time high and the bids we're doing are good. We're really more worried about the speed with which decisions get executed there then we're a cyclical down turn in trade magic, but John maybe will add something.
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. The key on freight management isn't really, how many miles were driven at all but it's only the number of people who were subscribing to our service. So it's the number of folks who are participating in the spot market for freight activity. So if you think about kind of a much less freight being moved in the future, I guess talk of the more around the long haul carriers and the folks are going from the import locations in Long Beach over the various distribution centers. But you still have the spot market where people who may have taken a load from say Atlanta to St. Louis need to be able to have a load to come back if they don't want to come back empty. And enabling that entire spot market to work and all of the brokers and occasional freight shippers, and the vast number of individuals and small truck drivers that are out there, it needs to be able to have access to that information if they're going be able to make any type of business plan that they may worked and we enabled them to have their business plan work effectively. So it's really around the number of people we're subscribing not the amount of frequency moved to the number of miles that are being driven.
Michael A. Schneider - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And TranScore's susceptibility, their lower municipal budgets etcetera?
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Probably less on the tolling side. I mean to the extent that there is, that we are working closely with them to understand the impact on what may happen there is. May be municipalities or cities may not want to invest to make their traffic run as smoothly as maybe they would during a good time, but on the other hand they'll be looking for ways to be able to generate revenue from their existing infrastructure. So they have existing roads that do not have toll run them today. So to the extent they may not invest as much for traffic efficiency. They may actually look at another tolling solutions, as they wouldn't have looked at otherwise.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think one think to keep in mind about TranScore is because we've been able to make it much more global effort that while we have this Mid East project which has the storage organic growth a bit last year and then sort of understated at this year as get it in, when we get into '09 based we don't have any distortion any more and that remains very high quality business and there is going to be substantial business in the Middle East next year so it does help insulators from downturn on municipal spending in TranScore. And remember RF, I think this is something that people are only maybe getting to start to understand isn't all about TranScore. The TranScore is a critical component but Inovonics is wonderful company, Technolog is wonderful company. Seaboard is just beyond a world class company; Horizon is going to give us massive synergies and opportunities. So, we've got big growth engines and side radio frequencies that have nothing to do with transportation, which was a big, big win across this year, in terms of how we continue to build out RF.
Michael A. Schneider - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Deane Dray with Goldman Sachs.
Deane M. Dray - Goldman Sachs: Thank you good morning. Could I just start with the clarification on the backlog, I know you mentioned the Z-Tech nuclear business being pushed out to '09, has there been any other material cancellations or push outs that you can comment on?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: No, I mean no, we could comment on any and all of them, But, there has been none. That's the only thing, and we weren't really expecting that, and it's really currency driven and we'd like to believe it will come back through in the fourth quarter, we don't think so. I think its going to be first quarter.
Deane M. Dray - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then Brain, I'll try to be diplomatic with this but there really is a remarkable disconnect between your commentary this morning about end market growth and opportunities heading into '09 versus every other multi industry companies this quarter that is addressing the pending global recession. What we didn't hear from you is anything about commentary on restructuring or contingency plans, events that heard a very optimistic tone. So, are there is within your contingency planning an expectation to see slowing growth?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think that we're sitting here with 26% EBITDA in the quarter. And, we certainly had contingency plans in place that a traditional industrial company would have with integrated manufacturing and all those locations that we have it. The realty I think is that, it is a degree that we have pressure next year that you would worried about. It's really less not a problem with our industrial businesses; it's really a problem with municipal spending risk and slowness in decisions. And, that's a bad news. The good news is that, we have got underlying long-term contracts with them, so we continue to be able to sustain our performance in most of these markets that maybe would not be able to grow on academic as much as we would have like. So, that's what we're going to struggle to figure out what kind of 2009, we think we are going to have. We don't have, most of our manufacturing facilities are tested in assembly basis, and so we don't... they don't.... I mean that kind of swing on a variable basis so there isn't some big thing all as we shut this down we could do that or if we did this, we could do that. And that's kind of where we are; I mean we're not arrogantly sitting here saying that we aren't going to have a problem, but every other company in the world has a problem, but the solution to our problem is it necessarily, I am saying I am taking a charge during and whack in all these people are, because the areas you tend to that are continuing to perform very well.
Deane M. Dray - Goldman Sachs: So, just as to clarify at this stage you are not expecting any change any deterioration in your backlog and order rates heading into '09?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well. I can't really say that without the providing guidance of '09. I just, I don't think that we know that type of better. I think we have a conference review coming up soon we will know more between now and then we are just starting Monday on looking at everybody. I think that we have the same kind of concern as everybody else would be to say come on now, yes, you had a terrific Q3 in order sales, when you look at Neptune be as flat enough push out in one energy situation, if those things hadn't happened and we do had great through organic growth. I wouldn't have had the courage to tell you that I think why, we grew 8% or 9% and we're going to continue to do that we've always said over any kind of cycle we are to grow at one to two times GDP people think we are conservative about this, because of our growth but you worked that where we are today Deane. I guess part of what destiny is we had a closing prices October 24th at $47.87 in October 24th 2006, two years ago from our call. And here we are trading wherever we are today and we've got base to look at 50% more EBITDA and we aren't expect our EBITDA performance or cash, performance to deteriorate we expected to improve. So, as always we are just cautious about indicating what order growth could be in '09 or revenue would be in '09, but certainly as we get into the first part of January and February we will be able to give you a better answer.
Deane M. Dray - Goldman Sachs: Great thank you.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: We will take our next question from Wendy Caplan with Wachovia.
Wendy B. Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Thanks, good morning.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, good morning.
Wendy B. Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Brian you referred to the camera business a couple of times in terms of the meeting that you've had, that you thought encouraged about. Can you give us some specifics about the actions that camera is taking to improve the margin?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I think that it's hard to be diplomatic about this, its classic case of the general manager over those businesses simply not being focused on what's important. And, I think people were confused and people were relying on the wrong kind of things, they were very encouraged to be reminded who we are, what we do and how we react and they were excited to get back to what they thought was who we were. And, we've un-winded a number of things, we had a guy running a business who is trying to put these things together in a artificial way and we killed all that and we've moved back to focusing on the niches that they serve. We've got the sales people aligned on the things they are to be aligned on it, it's a bit of out here chasing wind mills with systems design for cellular or research and we've got the great organizations there in this odd instance they just poorly well.
Wendy B. Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Okay that's helpful. And John, Brian described the working capital changes is unbelievable and they are pretty remarkable, it looks like most of it came form payables. Is there something unusual in that number and is it sustainable at that level?
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: To kind of look at the as a combination of the accounts receivable as well as unbilled. We do have some unbilled receivables that run through that tables and accruals with other accrued by all these lines on the cash flow statement. So, if you kind of add up the account receivables, the changes to the account receivables and the unbilled in differed revenues. So, we do get cash in advance that also goes into some other differed accounts there. So, take that plus inventory plus accounts payables. Net that gave us about $3 million positive in the quarter. In a quarter where we had a 11% growth and 4% organic growth. So, we're still able to grow the company and that would naturally lead to larger receivables balances that because of better collection efforts and where we have the opportunity really getting the advance payment that are very helpful to be able to fund our business. Those are the areas that we've been able to focus on along with just a relentless focus on inventory management. We don't want to have people who are looking at economic lower quantity as some traditional way to be able to get through a price break. And instead grab the price break but not with the economic order quantity and be able to work with suppliers as to they hold inventory instead of we hold inventory. The whole working capital management area is not overly sophisticated but it does come down to discipline. We have a great operating people and we benefit both those things.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And I also just want to say, I think what's really great. We may not have 6.5% maybe we get that every third quarter or something like that because of the team and the preferred revenue comes under system. But I think we've really have this thing down now with the mix of businesses we haven't disappointed twice that we're going to be able to run that working capital in the single digit frame work which is really what my dream was when we executed this program several years ago and pretty much everybody knows that when we come in. We want to look at how the variables are compared to inventory like to have it equal and we want to have receivables work that is function of pricing in terms with the born review that merchants have invested and we've kind of won today with people, not everybody's there, but you're also beginning to see the power of the acquisitions that we've made all throughout this year. Other people are focused on exactly what was their base revenue and exactly what are they going to do and we'll focus from the fact that they don't need any assets to run their business. And they throw up a lot of cash.
Wendy B. Caplan - Wachovia Securities: And finally Brian, can you give us some sense of the tone of the breakeven, how you doing meetings that you've recently had with your managers?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, probably have to ask to. Our breakeven stuff, it's absolutely crucial to how we talk and feel. I think all of our industrial based people and energy based people are going to pay even more attention to the breakeven discipline as they go through the planning cycle with our switch starts mainly because we're human and we're going to participate in this general economic situation whether we want to or not if they are at forefront of that. So, I love the discipline, we try not to force people to do things that they try to teach people what might be best and let them do it and occasionally we get it wrong, we got it wrong with the emerging people because we allow them to go a little further and they were paying attention to lyric. there was a break even in Spain, it was good morning lessen for us because we... it's a smaller part of the portfolio, parts were other just really terrific any way and shame on us for not being more disciplined with those people but we're on the case now and our data on break even when it helped us a lot to focus on what went wrong.
Wendy B. Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Thanks a lot.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Morgan Stanley.
Scott R. Davis - Morgan Stanley: Yes, good morning gentlemen.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, good morning.
Scott R. Davis - Morgan Stanley: Can you...I am not sure whether you disclosed this before that I just don't see it but the revenues that were added with Horizon and Technolog?
Unidentified Company Representative: For Horizon and Technolog we spent about $225 million for those two businesses and still contributes that in excess of $25 million in EBITDA in next year. We only had them for very small portion during the third quarter, about three weeks for Technolog and may be five weeks or so for Horizon. So they contributed modestly during the quarter, but we'll be able to get a full quarter of revenue from them in the fourth quarter.
Scott R. Davis - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And I was really in treated by the comments you made earlier in your prepared remarks about a deal multiples finally coming down I think most everyone else we've talked to have said that deal multiples have remained suddenly high and this isn't the price discovery obviously in public markets and there isn't public markets right now, I mean gosh I mean stocks are cheap, you're trading at six times EBITDA I mean, does it make sense which are looking at more public deals and just wait or do you actually think that this private market multiples are going to finally get down of those kind of levels, I means its barely been 10 years since we've seen deal down six times EBITDA but that's the environment we're in unfortunately.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I think, in the short run that, what people would say probably who are involved in that if you're talking to private equity people and what people will say, I have a lot time for people who'll say they're not seeing the multiples come down. But those are public people who aren't directly involved in activity right now. I can tell you that, we walked away from two transactions both in medical, both with double-digit growth, both with substantial EBITDA, both were synergies that we thought were really good and they would have been bought at multiple that was reasonable in our public market environment. We would borrow most of public market environment but we will the collapse in the multiples, we told both parties that don't fall with there own, we just were in a longer, that we were not going to pay more for the company. I don't care how good you are than we are, because with all due respect to you, we're better than you, because we're less at risk and more and... I know that both the private equity sellers, I mean, we ended those conversations in a friendly way they understand it. Those two people would not agree with what I am saying, but they lost there deals to us. And it did not take very long before they are going to ask themselves whether they were the done guy who didn't take the right offer for his house and wound up selling up later for 40% less. So, I understand where they are headed now, I agree as a public company, we're all, we would have always said, you haven't tried Roper looking at public company because we wouldn't pay a control premium often appropriate market base price. But there are so many companies miss priced in the market place today. We've spent the better part of the last three weeks modeling everybody and looking at people with cash on their balance sheet and people that have a variety of reasons to reconsider stuff. So, we have opportunities we never dream possible frankly Scott.
Scott R. Davis - Morgan Stanley: Yes, I would imagine so. And just lastly guys, I guess, there has been some, I mean, the Pennsylvania turnpike failure was a little bit of a surprise to most people and this stuff actually matters that much to you, I mean, whether its privately owned or publicly owned there pretty much need to buy your services. But, is there any disappointment there as a privatized turnpike they might actually spend more for collection or upgrade in technology?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well that's considering our customers; it's a question that one would ask answer diplomatically. Fundamentally, we've always believed that if you had more PPP's, Public Private Partnerships situation they might spend more capital and they would maybe look at pay back analysis and that present value and the kind of things that our capital expenditure we would look at. When you are working directly with the end user, its critically important politically that you get the right kiosk with the right exit location that state congressmen is on exit 22, I can guarantee there is a lot of pressure to have a kiosk at exit 22. So, it's fundamentally different. We think we have the preeminent technology in the space, we can read or write different peoples, technology. So, for us we're the best to bid for the supply for tolling in North America by a mile and where they, the best data collection technology globally we may not be the least expense of the globally, because people do use some other technology, and that's kind of... I don't think it goes one way or another too much, I think we did believe if people like quarry and global viewers and others were continuing to do what they were doing that it might escalate our growth in that area. Though, at the moment it doesn't matter the business we have locked in long-term and we'll continue and the growth is not clear.
Scott R. Davis - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Fair enough, thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Citi Investment Research.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Citigroup: Good morning, Brain. And, just a couple of quick things, under Z-Tech seeing Brian it sounds a little peculiar and in a sense, I just wonder if you think maybe there is something broader going on with some of this nuke spending, in other words nuke upgrade is a big dollars, I mean what would be disperse to take Z-Tech which seems to be very, very minor in that grand scheme of things, I mean you think there's some other sub plant to what's going on in that end market?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: No, I'll let John cover that it's all of me its working and I just don't want to name the countries. But, all most to little obvious, what I'm had kind of forcing liquidity place currency swing that's refurbishment activity and stuff they have to do, and the guys sitting there saying, well the dollar is going to stay there, I mean, of course without commenting on his decision would have cost them less prudent its really. I don't know may be it swings in Q1 and I think whatever is going to happen with currency it is an enormous question about 2009. Go ahead, John.
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: In the data to deal I mean these operators still need to be able to perform their required maintenance and we give them the ability to do so. How they do that I, is what is, is what changed a little bit in the third quarter they can either use maybe existing equipment that maybe outdated, but still sufficient in order to comply with whatever regulations they have or they could adopt what's really become more of an industry standard or mid ADEID technology which is a robotic way of being able to actively test within crack serve or any other structure integrity issues inside the cooling tower. And, so some folks really just made a decision to use their older technologies there is a newer thing that we introduced that almost three years ago now, where you can imagine these, these nuclear power plants are not the fastest as new technology adopters and so that's the adoption curve of the newer technology continues to be very positive but some folks that we're expecting to ahead and upgrade in the third quarter now the late guys. So they are buying instead of a new instrument with new probes or they are just buying new probes. So, that delayed their decision a little bit, and pushed that off into what we think may be their net doubted season, which could be the first quarter.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And, I wouldn't have risen too much in the. It just happen to hit us, it's about having agency $10 million dollars swing here in a $2.3 billion company.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Citigroup: And, then one another energy related topic Brian, oil sands, I mean I would think the economics to some of those projects, look in a little squishy with the, $60 or $70 oil. Are there any change in dialogue up there, and Alberta as it relates to, what's going on to your businesses?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: No, not with our businesses. Not really. I mean we've got an installed base at activity you got shutoff for thousand diesel engines. And, you got to rid with eco business we acquired, and it's going to have a record results or ramp up businesses doing exceptionally well, we're not really seeing anything there that's material at all.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Citigroup: And, then I just finally on Horizon, maybe just a little bit more understand on how their business model works. Are you selling seats of software how does the revenue actually get generated some sort because it's a little bit different at what happens to Seaboard and then just your initial thoughts on how you might actually put the businesses together and the leverage the synergy there?
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well I'll take the first part of that there revenue recognition model is really very similar to Seaboard and they sell software to schools. And now they have a slightly different, because they are not really as much as in the renting software business as the Seaboard is. So Seaboard really doesn't sale the software base sale a license which allowed the customer to use for a year and they sell that same license again in the next year. Horizon really sells the software, so for them it's around an installed base and upgrade model, that didn't goes lot there two other pieces to what Horizon does in terms of revenue. One is going to be whatever equipment they goes along with that, which enables either at point of sale device to be able to host the software so the sale or point of sale, as well as what we hope to be a key part of the growth going forward is winding machines which will also have communication with the software. So what is winded and the winding machine is also known and can be reported as something that a student would have been able to consume for lunch and instead of standing in long line. So those are the key areas around revenue and I'll hand it over to Brian on the synergy opportunity.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, what we have Horizon that has we've several very strong people on it building a better organization as well, going to deal of the growth because they have been growing high take in these special with it. Now the execution gets to the Los Angeles School District is enormous. And we actually have Horizon reporting through Seaboard. So Tim is looking after the integration of Horizon business. There is an immediate synergy cost because we're using micros technology to point sale activity in Seaboards, which is a relatively high cost application technology we've been much lower application technology to more processing. But what is going on in there, cellular world is frankly less sophisticated. What happens is that in the newer market there is like $2.30 and $2.60 so that school can claim against government lunch programs for certain kind of people and $0.60 for other kind of people and $0.30 for other kind of people and you can imagine how difficult that selection technology is and if you can go along for a software and its proven you have a big way up, as the people deal with that. So we really expect more mandated requirements not less in the area with thousand of obesity that you see here, really big opportunities to continue to do things. We have good software people at Horizon, we just got a much deeper scale of business at Seaboard and Seaboard-Horizon are going to be better together and then having them separate.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Citigroup: And just finally real quick is the really debt extinguishment charge in other expense and interest expense?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: In other expense.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Citigroup: Right. Thank you.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Next we'll have with Matt Summerville from Keybanc.
Matt J. Summerville - Keybanc Capital Mkts/McDonald: Most of my questions have been answered Brian. I was just curious as to what the Technolog and Horizon, how much of the revenue there would you say as recurring. And then just on a year-over-year basis in the second half of the year, I think you maybe said $8 to $10 million but in percentage terms how much is Z-Tech's business down?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Just to make in those Q3 specifically one customer was down $4 million and I think the total was down about $8 million. For what would have been and... starting in the booking season, so I remember in order and sales variance in Q3 and we're still bit okay that what... we could roll in into what we thought we would able to shift in Q4, so we just took it out.
Matt J. Summerville - Keybanc Capital Mkts/McDonald: Okay. And then my first question on Technolog and Horizon, how much of the revenue would you classify as recurring?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Almost all of it. With Technolog it's a kind of a unique model they sell the collection technology so that's certainly new, but then they are paying to provide the information as radically different model and what happens in the U.S. or people will sell the automated meter reading hardware and not be involved in the collecting of the information to billing and the information of providing people stuff. In the UK, there's a lot of concern about gasoline, carbon dioxide, just all kinds of issues they want data on and we're maintaining all the infrastructure to provide that data to the utilities. So, it's a different business model, that you have a North America. They're getting routine service work in addition to producing the tallow product that when we get out to start traveling, you'll be able to see, its as good a group of leadership people as we've ever been able to require in the company. And these people have been building a great business for quite a long period of time. And we were just very fortunate that they wanted to give in their growth opportunities to get involved with somebody that was going to be able to continue to invest in them as oppose to having republic in this market.
Matt J. Summerville - Keybanc Capital Mkts/McDonald: Great, that's all I have. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Now we'll end up question-and-answer session for this call. We will now turn back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. Thank you, and thank you all for joining us this morning. And if you have anything further you can give me a call. And we look forward to talking to you again in other three months.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today's presentation. Thank you for you attendance. Have a great day. .

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the Roper Second Quarter 2008 Financial Results Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mr. John Humprey, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Humprey, please go ahead sir.
John Humprey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you. Thank you all for joining us this morning, as we discuss the results of our second quarter performance. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Paul Sony, Vice President and Controller. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our second quarter financial results. The press release also includes telephonic replay information for today's call. We've prepared slides to accompany today's call which are available through the webcast and also available on our website which is www.roperind.com. Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2. You'll once again see our Safe Harbor statement. I want to remind you that today's call will include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, additional information of our specific risks are included in our SEC filings. You should listen in today's call in the context of all that information. Now if you'll please turn to Slide 3, I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks we'll take questions. So with that, Brian.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you John, and good morning everyone. If we move to what is labeled Slide 3, Roper second quarter 2008 overview. I'll start with the fact this was a record financial performance quarter by virtually any measure, and when we say a record, we don't just mean a record second quarter, we mean a historical record quarter for any quarter in the history of the Company. Our orders were $606 million. Our sales were $594 million. Our net earnings were 76 million. Our EBITDA performance was $151 million in the quarter, and our DEPS number is $0.80. And as many of you just noted there is a little noise in that number, and certainly be viewed at a much higher rate. We had some specific challenges in the quarter, imaging which we're going to talk about. We can't really excuse the performance from imaging in any way. But it can be put in context, so that it's more clearly understood. Then we had the Middle East toll project comparison, which has a lag on what's happening in terms of internal growth in the company, we'll explain that. The reality is it's in a wonderful situation for from us this quarter forward. And then third, we had a special charge which as, you know it's very unusual for us to have or to take, and we'll explain what happened around there. Then, we'll look at the financial results and some perspective about our results, some strategic things that occurred in the quarter, and then a review, a little more granular review of the four segments, and then an update on the guidance for Q3 and the rest of the year. So if we turn to the next slide. You'll see challenges in the quarter. For us the organic growth comparison due to the 2007 mid-east tolling project, where it was starting up in installation with quite a bit of revenue, and not a lot of income, which is the way a project like that starts. Made it an extremely difficult comparison from a pure organic revenue number, but not a difficult comparison as you can see from our margin numbers. That was a drag on organic growth in our quarter of 2%. Then in terms of imaging which had disappointing performance and which was completely off plan. Their sales and margin performance reduced our overall organic growth number by 2% as well. What happened to them is that they had a number of OEM customers who had slower than expected sales commitments from them. And today I had done a specific series of product development projects for three different people, and those were to ship in the second quarter and third quarter, and in reality they seem to have been pushed back until later in the year. That pushback resulted in them missing their cost structure because they have the unrecovered product development costs that they expected to be offsetting against the revenue in those businesses. What's really amazing, and I know it's absolutely true on a nominal basis. You could see Q2 decelerating from Q1. If you exclude, the mid-east project and you look at all of the rest of the business and Roper with the exception of imaging, we had exactly the same 8% organic sales growth in the second quarter that we had in the first quarter. Imaging added one in Q1, so you saw seven. If we neutralize imaging, you get eight in the first quarter for everything and eight in the second quarter for everything. So we do not have an organic growth problem. We have an imaging problem, and that is being aggressively addressed. We spent last Friday with imaging. We had a meeting again last night with some of their control function people, and we will be meeting some of them again next week. They have a series of plans in place, and we expect a lot of results out of imaging in terms of cost issues. And then thirdly, we have this special $3.5 million charge for Neptune. Thank goodness, Neptune has world class manufacturing and incredibly fine quality control operation. And it was noted that we had 10-meters, which had what appeared to be some kind of problem. And they were able to take those ten and really diagnose what was going on. And we got a bad component supplied by normally good vendor. We're talking to him about that. But because we have to find those particular items, and it's a small number of meters compared to the total number that we've shipped. We're going to have some considerable labor costs around that in terms of field repair. And we felt obligated to book that expense which is what we did at $3.5 million pre-tax, once your tax have been divide by the share count, you can see what that did in terms of earnings per share number. More importantly, it masked the incredible operating margin and gross margin performance in the quarter, and even with that it was outstanding. But that took 190 basis points off of our operating margin in industrial and it took 60 basis points off of our full enterprise number. Now, despite those difficulties in the quarter, we had a record performance against virtually every measure. So if we go to the next slide. As we said, orders, backlog, the sales, the earnings, EBITDA, and diluted earnings per share, all a record for any quarter in our history. Our as reported sales are up 12% that comes from acquisitions of about 6%. Our internal growth if you exclude the Middle East project but allow the negative drag on the imaging performance was still up 8%. And on a nominally reported basis you can see it was 6% with 2 points of FX. On the orders line, orders were up 14%, internal growth again at 8% excluding the Middle East project, and we'll talk more about that as we go through the morning. With the reported internal growth as you can see at 5 with 2 points of FX. The gross margins in the quarter were up 200 basis points. The Company feels particularly good about that because as we've noticed everybody reporting, you see margin deterioration and very many companies with cost push inflation on material and energy costs. And instead of having lower gross margins, they're actually up 200 basis points in the quarter, and that includes the 60 bps special charge that we had to take for the vendor issue. Net earnings were up 24% to $76 million, and the diluted earnings per share were at $0.80, up from $0.66 in the second quarter of '07. Operating cash flow was particularly strong for a second quarter at Roper. It was up to $96 million which represented about 16.2% of revenue. And given what we have here and what we'll talk about on a segment-by-segment basis. We feel particularly good about the second half growth and are confident that we'll report record operating cash flow for the full year. Next slide, we put the enterprise book-to-bill ratio slide in here. Just so we can once again get you to maybe focus on the exceptionally unusual nature of this Middle Eastern project that we had, which we initially started to book in the fourth quarter of '06. As you can see if you go up and down a range of 3% to or negative 3%, our book-to-bill ratio comes in between 0.97% and 1.03% most of the time. And here in the second quarter our book-to-bill ratio for the company came in at 1.02%, sort of the high end actually of those kind of variances, and the highest book-to-bill we've had since the first quarter of '07. We have very fast cycle times in the company, and frequently we're on kind of a two to four month window of activity. So if somebody push something out or we pull something in, you can have some variances in the quarter. But on balance it's a pretty wonderful set of businesses that are delivering consistent growth for us. Next slide, Q2 strategic wins. Really in addition to running the business and a lot of good things about it, some very important things occurred. When we go back to talking about the Middle East project and we're reading some of the things we said in the past about it. We described that really as missionary work, and it was. It's certainly very far a field of the normal activity that we've been involved in historically at TransCore. It's a long way from Florida and Texas, and Washington. What was done there was nothing short of spectacular. And while initially you put a lot of dollars into the design and the installation and the equipment pass through, once you get to our pure hardware and our tags, then you get what the whole process was about. So it did have a drag on organic growth in the quarter for 2%, but that's not negative income or negative cash. And it forms a baseline for continuous secular growth in that project, and other projects that we think will impact us in the future because we now have a turnkey case study and we have had a very large number of visitors to look at this project to see how they could implement a similar thing in their various countries. We move to the second point, Neptune was selected by Toronto, Canada, to enter into contract discussions to supply the city and area of Toronto with a water automated meter reading project. The potential for that based on the City Council and the Toronto Globe made a report it's a little over $190 million over a multi-year period, and contract discussions with the City are in place. Assuming that everything goes well, we could start to see orders for that perhaps as early as the end of this year with shipments beginning in the first quarter. At this time we can't book any of that order flow, until we finalize the contract and have it. But the selection has been made that if will be Neptune and our business. The third area similar kind of break through was the Florida Turnpike has decided to move to our eGo Plus sticker tag technology, this is similar to what happened in Texas a year-ago. We've got an order in-house for 1.5 million tags, a significant portion of that will be shipping now. And we also had a phenomenal second quarter out of CBORD which is a big success story for us. It's immediately helped as we knew it would, you can see that, in terms of the gross margins and the RF segment. You can see it in terms of the operating margins in the RF segment. And the story around CBORD, we think will just continue to get better over the next couple of years. We've seen a number of adjacencies. We have a variety of projects under way and frankly see some acquisitions in this space that are going to expand CBORD's reach. Lastly on the significant wins is a recapitalization of the debt structure of Roper. We had our debt basically expiring in 2009. We have a convertible security that was due in January, and we had the rest of the debt structure due later. We were able to move from a secured credit facility to an unsecured credit facility, and that resulted in Moody's upgrading the company to investment grade status, and we'll talk about the significance of that a little later this morning. All of those five things really helped position the company for long-term consistent growth. Next slide. Here we'll begin to talk about the second quarter results in terms of a nominal straightforward America look. The income statement, as you can see net sales were up 12%. We exclude the Middle East project they were up 8% internally. The gross profit up from 49.4 to 51.4 would have been of course 52 without the special charge. Income from ops up 17% that of course included the $3.5 million charge, so if you think about leverage and ratios, that 19 if you add 3.5 to your 22.5 on a revenue variance up there about 63, so it's an outstanding capture of the incremental margin. Interest costs actually helped us in the quarter, because we had a terrific amount of cash with $96 million coming in, and transaction that we're going to talk about later occurred just at the end of the quarter one just in the past week, so we had a bit more cash on hand. That saved us about $3 million in interest costs compared to the prior year, and that $3 million largely offset the special charge for $3.5 million, so that was beneficial to us. The net earnings as you can see are up 24%, or sales up 12, net earnings up 24% and the earnings per share at 80 include the $3.5 million charge, and they also include another penny cost for the increased shares associated with the convertible security product. Next slide. Here we look at trend of our trend line information and how that continues to move forward. Our trailing 12-month revenue was a $1.566 billion at the end of the second quarter in 2006. Last year that trailing 12 months revenue had reached to $1.902, and this year our trailing 12 months revenue has reached $2.230 billion. Our EBITDA has gone up from $378 million just two years ago to $473 million last year, and up another $95 million this year to 568 million. Beneath those bars are the trailing 12 months EBITDA, you will see our EBITDA margins on the 12-month period ending Q2 '06 were 24.1%. And this year they're up to 25.5%, so we continue to get the consistent expansion in our margins that you should have become used to. Next slide. Here if we look at the cash generation, it was particularly strong for Q2. Last year, our operating cash flows as a function of revenue was 14.8% in the quarter. This year it is up 130 basis points to 16.1% in the quarter. Our net working capital has gone down once again in the second quarter second. We picked up a 40 basis points improvement as we look at net working capital as a function of revenue. In the second quarter declined to 10.4% compared to the prior year, and our first half operating cash flow has already reached to $167 million, up 23% from last year. Next slide. Our financial capacity continues to grow and this slide probably doesn't detect just how powerful our cash machine has become. You can see on June 30th this year, we had $120 million of cash… $146 million, I am sorry. The net debt was right exactly $1 billion, so net debt is up $70 million from a year ago. However, we've invested $406 million in the last twelve months in acquisitions which are driving improved EBITDA performance, and only increased $70 million in debt, so that our metrics are actually better than they were before the $406 million investment of the past twelve months. Our net debt to debt cap has dropped from 36.4 to 33.8 at the end of the second quarter. EBITDA is up from 473 to 568. Our net debt-to-EBITDA as a ratio has dropped from 1.97 to 1.76, and our EBITDA to interest coverage ratio has gone from 9.55 to nearly twelve times. That gives us a lot of capacity to take advantage of what's a very target rich environment in the acquisition arena. Next slide. Here is commentary around Moody's that we think we certainly appreciate. You can see that they made an upgrade to Baa3 status as investment grade. Each one of these categories you can see on the website about how they're rated. You'll see some AA ratings and A ratings on Roper. The indicative rating for Roper would be BAA1 which is two notches above the current rating we have, and implies the strength of the directions we've driven the company. Here you can see the their own… the upgrade considered the significant improvement in Roper scale and diversity characteristics achieved over a period of time through a number of well-executed acquisitions, as well as the company's demonstrated inherence to a disciplined financial policy, including modest usage of leverage and maintenance of adequately liquidity at this despite the inquisitive growth strategy. So we thank Moody's for recognition, and all of the people who made those miracle numbers possible. Next slide. New acquisitions since we last talked with you. We've had two important acquisitions. One is a pure bolt-on where we're going to say a UK company called Chouen. We're going to integrate that into our AMI business. It's another shut-off valve manufacturer that the marine industry and engine industry can use for safety protection. And then we've made a more significant acquisition of somebody that's in our TransCore freight matching space. This is a really a leader in terms of the number of owner operators that subscribe to that service. They actually have about 30,000 people subscribing to their service. It's a low cost provider with a lot of entry level services. By acquiring this business we get an interesting in-flow of people that become first time participants in the process. They can stay with the company that we've acquired. We also have an opportunity to upgrade them into our broader band of services. There are some synergies associated with this, and we're going to do the integration of this over months, not days. It is a very, very helpful high margin business very light asset business, not a lot of sales in here because the margins are really high, and variable cost of winning a customer is very low, but still a terrific business. We've indicated to you that $97 million investment ought to produce more than $11 million of EBITDA in 2009, and the pipeline we have for continuing acquisitions we can assure you is quite full. Next slide, here if we look at the segment performance of the four segments. We want to focus for just a minute about the relative importance of these businesses because our industrial segment which includes Neptune represents 31% of our total revenue. You can see their EBITDA performance is 29%. Our radio frequency business has caught up actually to the industrial businesses it's now neck-and-neck with them in a race at 29%. And RF business is now up at 51% gross margin, so let's hear it for CBORD. And then you move over and you see energy. Energy is at 28% EBITDA. Those three businesses represent 85% of our company. And then we have our imaging business which had such disappointing performance in the second quarter, we want to remind ourselves it is only 15% of the enterprise and inside that of more than a fourth of its our medical business, which we could move into any one of these three graphs on the left hand side. So it really is the camera businesses that have frankly spent a lot of money in R&D to deliver products that people aren't yet ready to buy. And we're going to have to sort through that here in this quarter. We can take a look then at the total enterprise gross margin 51% EBITDA margins at 25, we've put all of our unallocated corporate costs into that category. And we'd say again that while imaging can't be excused, it can't be put into context. Next slide. On the industrial technology front again 31% of our revenue, you'll see sales were up 14%, orders were up 2%, and operating profit margins were up 90 basis points over the prior period to 26%. That would have been higher number if we hadn't had the charge. On an internal basis there it gets a little bit tricky. The internal sales number of course because there are no acquisitions is up 14%, but the internal order number was only up 2. And the reason that's only up 2 is not because we had light orders but because in the second quarter last year we booked some very large jobs, Raleigh, North Carolina, and several other places for Neptune. So we had very basically flat order situation or less there but very strong order performance for all the rest of the business. On an internal growth basis virtually every one of our industrial businesses save one was up more than 10%, and that story line is still very strong and in fine shape. In this third quarter, we would expect that the internal growth in this segment will return to a more normalized number. The results we said include the $3.5 million special charge. The orders growth was impacted in the quarter, had everything gotten finished with somebody like Toronto or one of the other project pipelines, you wouldn't have seen this kind of temporary lag in internal orders. Very strong operating performance across the board, we just finished our quarterly review, with those people. everybody in the room save this one guy felt they would do better in the second half than the first half, and when you look at leverage $41 million of operating profit a year ago, $48 this year, booking $3.5 million would have been $1.5, $10.5 million of new operating profit on what looks to me like $22 million of sales. That's a ratio most people could live with that up 48%. Okay, next slide here we're looking at our radio frequency business. A business it's 30% of Roper sales as we speak, certainly CBORD's addition to this has helped the importance of RF in our total portfolio. Sales were up 17%. Orders were up 32%. Our operating profit margins went up 330 basis points to 23.8% compared to a year ago. Now the internal numbers look a little different. The internal numbers are down 1%, but again this is all about the Middle East project, and of course, the fact that CBORD grew dramatically in the quarter, but goes to acquisition revenue. It doesn't go to our baseline. If it were in our baseline, you would have seen very strong double-digit order growth out of that business. Orders were up 6%. The transition the transfer guys have been able to make in the mid-east is really a wonderful thing. And if you exclude that projects kind of dig through the python situation, you find internal sales in the quarter were down 1%, but were up 5 and that internal orders were actually up 17% in the quarter. Our CBORD was off to a terrific start, they had an all-time record quarter, they got their prepaid for variety things. Their subscription revenue was up well above 15%. Each one of the businesses that we have in here has a very solid program in place to continue to improve margins and they looking particularly in the traffic design area, and John has done great work on getting the projects an service margins are up which is helps us. And of course getting out of the installation phase in the Middle East helps us., and we're positioned very well we think for a strong third and fourth quarter in the second half. Next slide. Here we look at Energy Systems and controls. It's now 24% of Roper's. Our revenue, its sales were up 15%. The orders were up 13%. Operating margins improved 90 basis points to 24.6%. Most of this is internal as you can see internal sales were up 11%, internal orders were up 9%. We continue to have strong demand for the control systems that we produce, the sensors that we provide and the other protective technologies that were used out in oil and gas markets and green applications. The acquisition that we've made, and there are these bolt-ons over the last two years are all performing well. Of the operating leverage, we continue to get, because as we bring out new products they tend to have better margins. And this bolt-on acquisition that we mentioned in the UK, the Chouen guys, are going to give us a broader family of products like Roda Deaco for Western Canada for Europe and Asia, so we think that will really improve our suite of products to offer. Next slide. On scientific and industrial imaging, last and in this case least, I suppose, it certainly was an unacceptable quarter. Their sales were down 3%, their orders were up 3, there operating margins declined 210 basis points compared to the prior year. Internal sales weren't really any better. You can see they were down 1 and orders were up 5, so they're encouraged by the orders, but expect orders to be up substantially more than that. They've got a lot of excuses. We said it was like watching the British Open the other day. Lots of headwinds, lots of terrible execution, but wonderful reasons why, and you could all understand them. And as we went through all of this with them, we were empathetic to the reasons articulated, but you still have to the make the shots, and they simply didn't. The OEMs have pushed out orders. That's really okay. But at Roper, we don't really accept those things, so we'll have to take action in that area. The margin performance was just a failed process around their budgeting on product development. We had to listen to people humiliatingly say, well I guess, maybe, gee, oh, wow. The controller that's in that core business longer with the company, and we've gotten an aggressive overview, what's going on. We got a lot of current actions in place and talk more about that in the third quarter. Next slide. Here we look at our guidance. The guidance for the rest of the year, and this requires a little bit of explanation as well, I think. Last year we earned 2.68. Our guidance going into yesterday was 3.13 to 3.21 of we raised the full year guidance to 3.16 to 3.22, but that includes eating the $0.2 or $0.03 or more of this special charge. So frankly, the guidance needs to be 3.19 to 3.25, in order for us to produce 3.16 to 3.22. So we intend to produce between 3.16 to 3.22, based on us eating that special charge. So we've raised the guidance perhaps more than it looks like in our press release. In the third quarter, we expect to earn between $0.81 and $0.83. We have established operating cash flow guidance for the year at $390 to exceed $390 million. And then you can see our EBITDA, we've increased again to suggest that we will produce more than $610 million of EBITDA in 2008 and net earnings will exceed $299 million based on the low end of the guidance. Next slide. Here is the conference call summary. We had, as we've indicated record performance across virtually every area. The organic growth trends are actually better than they can appear. I am sure there was a way for to us articulate that better in our press release, but we spent a lot of time on it with the best we could do. It is the fist time we put a table like that in there. We probably need to introduce as asterisks for you so that you can better understand it. We're positioned for second half growth and record operating cash flow. The first half acquisitions that we've made are all contributing immediately. They are immediately crash accretive. No dilution in any of them. The new unsecured credit facility means that we can continue to move forward with our deal structure and not be faced with a risk of what kind of debt we would have going into 2009. The upgrade at Moody's means long-term borrowing costs will be less than they were if we were simply a split-rated enterprise and more importantly right now it means that we've got access to the debt markets to do whatever we want to do inside our firm commitment to remain investment grade going forward. The Florida Turnpike Enterprise upgrade the eGo sticker technology is a major win for us, and we think it will prove to be so for the State of Florida. The Toronto selection of Neptune to enter into contract discussions to put in place the process to fulfill this order for over $190 million is of course an enormous win, maybe the biggest water project that's ever happened in North America. CBORD off to a great start, record quarter, you can see why we love the business. All you have to do is look at the margin variations that we're already producing in RF. Our backlog reached a record of $602 million, so that felt good to us. And the acquisition pipeline wanted only is attractive, but it's really exciting, and we think our guidance reflects that. And so we're positioned for more records throughout the year. With that, we'd open it up for questions. QUESTION AND ANSWER
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question we go to Jeff Sprague with Citi.
Jeffery Sprague - Citigroup: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
John Humprey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Morning.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffery Sprague - Citigroup: Brian, I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit of a backdrop of how Toronto evolved, what you think drove the decision in your favor and this is the second or third quarter in a row now where we heard about Mexico or Africa, and now it's Toronto? Maybe what else is kind of in the forward pipeline of things that you're working on, even if you can't name, name, so to speak?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well Toronto is such a large thing. It's an enormous project. Just think about recently New York selected a fixed network system for high density application and doesn't involve us because it's not what we do. And everybody thinks that's wonderful, it's $30 million box or something, and this is $190 million, get out of here. It's an enormous job. We're going to be leading all the elements of the job, using a variety of different products that we have and some things we'll be acquiring from others. So we're very excited about that. It confirms again to people that are considering big projects that we're the most sophisticated and most customer friendly group to deal with those, and there are other products you could buy which are less expensive. But on balance, people want accuracy and they want quality and they want friendly service and all of those things were important. This is a very long-term project that Dave Stoddard has been working on in Canada for Neptune. And they've put a lot of time and energy into this. In Canada, unlike the US, we actually install the meter frequently for an additional fee. I think our track record in working in frozen tundra and having meters that don't leak, and digital readouts that work in a very tough environmental area was important. Now having said that, it's a public bid process, everybody knows what you bid in, and they know what our average price for the register is, they know what the meter was. We were certainly low or the highest value producer if anybody and all the stuff is really public. There was a City of Toronto thing out there, we were reading through it again last night to make sure we weren't miss quoting anything. But there's a lot of negotiations still going on. The City has got to decide how fast it's going to roll this out, and what have you. Now as far as other projects we continue to find a growing number of people who are deeply concerned about the accuracy of the reading of information. And this tends to be an opportunity that until last year, we probably were missing internationally. So we have quite a few quotes out, in places that you just wouldn't think about. Basically the stand countries, where they're realizing that, hey, you know what, I don't really know for sure what people are consuming, and it's about time I found out, because their consumption is something I want to discourage. And I don't want third party people not telling me the truth about consumption. So we've really beefed up that activity. And I think we know better how to address this market. So I think that's good. Now having said that, I do think Neptune's going to have just a little bit of lumpiness. This quarter certainly people were very worried about us having decelerating internal growth because, we had out performance in the second quarter a year-ago and couldn't replace with the Raleigh project in the second quarter. But, wow, if Toronto was something you could have booked then people would have blown through and say we had accelerating performance. So variety is over a continuous twelve-month measure period, we expect to move ahead.
Jeffery Sprague - Citigroup: Great. And then I guess on a similar vane, different business, as you indicated. Now that you've got a kind of firm marker in the ground, Turnkey in the Middle East, people kicking the tires on the idea. Could we… should we expect some new development there in the next whatever you want to call it, six months, twelve months, on the project side in some other area?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I will say this. We've had a tremendous of amount of activity, because people, one, they like to go to the place and check it out. There are several peoples who have been there more than once. We are fielding a lot of questions about how that works. And there is some considerable international activity in and around that area, but we don't have any firm commitments from anybody about them rolling out something similar to what we've done here. But we are effectively providing people with information about the design and cost structures and time for install and what have you. So I think we would be surprised if anything happened in the next six months, but I wouldn't rule it out, and I think it's more likely that neighboring countries or people who are visiting there and see the opportunity for it would think about deploying it. I think the good news is unlike the US when an international player decides to deploy, they actually decide to deploy and they do it. You don't have a whole lot of issues because there tends to be less political pushback. Here you always have these kind of political things that draw things out for very long period of time. So clearly, if we didn't have the install base in the Middle East, we wouldn't have an opportunity to do another $100 million project, but because we've got it, and it is working flawlessly, it is giving us a lot of new opportunities. When we'll take advantage of those, I have no idea.
Jeffery Sprague - Citigroup: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: We go next to Mike Schneider with Robert Baird.
Michael Schneider - Robert Baird: Good morning, guys.
John Humprey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Mike.
Michael Schneider - Robert Baird: Sticking with Toronto for a second, is it a drive by, or is it a fixed network project, Brian?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: There are several different aspects. But we're going to be deploying what used to be the hexagram a fixed network for a portion of this that we will get from them and install ourselves with our radios and registers.
Michael Schneider - Robert Baird: So it's primarily a fixed network, maybe with some drive by on the periphery?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Right.
Michael Schneider - Robert Baird: Okay. And then do you anticipate supplying the underlying meters, as well I presume?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, absolutely.
Michael Schneider - Robert Baird: Okay. And then the margin impact, when you had large projects like this in the past, the Middle East for example, in the tolling space generally been lower margin and we've talked about that several quarters as it's run through the P&L, is that going to be the case with Toronto in the industrial tech segment?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Nothing like the situation that you have with an install and traffic there won't… first of all, nothing Neptune does in flow, it won't be much of a drag. But there will be some stuff that's passed through and to the degree we have the pass-through and we'll give everybody plenty of warning around that. It will be in our guidance as things roll out. As these things rollout, that won't be… you can't take the 190 I assume a full normalized industrial EBITDA number on every aspect of it.
Michael Schneider - Robert Baird: Because there will be pass-through on.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Some, but you make money on everything. It's not like this kind of 6% to 8% margin work, 10% or margin work that you're doing. There is some install work, because Dave does a lot of install in Canada, and that's okay, doesn't type any assets, but it will still be quite substantial.
Michael Schneider - Robert Baird: Okay. And switching to tolling, the Florida order of 1.5 tags, at least I have learned that the first year projection of tag rollouts I believe was only 600,000, and I believe the early adoption just in the first three weeks of July was very strong. Is this a multiyear order or do they expect to actually exceed the initial estimate of 600 by more than 2?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I wouldn't speak for them, but it's an immediate order. I mean we're making product and shipping product. It's not a multiyear order. This is just the initial order for the product.
Michael Schneider - Robert Baird: Okay, CBORD, final question. Just what type of growth if you look on their organic basis, are they growing at this point?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Mid-teens.
Michael Schneider - Robert Baird: Okay. Thank you and congratulations, guys.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Operator: We go next to Wendy Caplan with Wachovia.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia: Hi. Good morning.
John Humprey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hey, good morning.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia: Brian, the imaging problems that you referenced, it is not really new news. This is a business that has been problematic for awhile. Can you sort of walkthrough for us what your… first breakout the camera business for us, so we know what we're dealing with today, and also your thoughts in terms of strategic actions that we might see regarding this camera business?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think that you will see some strategic actions. We brought back a terrific person who some of you know you know, Don Templeman who used to be involved in Gatan and was involved in Princeton Instruments and he use to run Cornell. And so he's had a lot of experience, and was our Investor Relations person for a while. And Don has done a terrific job in trying to rescue the Princeton camera business down there, and was instrumental in us being able to divest the Redlake Motion business. We had Don join us on Friday, for a walk through of what Ben calls the micro imaging analyses group, which is containing Photometrics and Q. Photometrics has in past years used to be coupled up with Princeton as Roper Scientific. And Gatan felt that they could drive more out of Photometrics by getting it moderating with Gatan, and they have achieved that. They've driven more of the profit out of Photometrics, they've driven more of the organic growth out of it, and they managed to do everything that one worries about when you let people consolidate. So that was a failed concept, and we worked with them all day Friday. We brought other people in. We brought people in who previously had responsibility for the business. And we are going to look strategically at what we want to do about this business because it's just flat out not acceptable. It's about half of the imaging segment. So I don't have that number in front of me but.
John Humprey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Roughly $90 million.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: It's about.
John Humprey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Its roughly $90 million in the quarter.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: So the cameras might have been 50 or something like that.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And also the acquisitions that you mentioned, I don't think I heard you give us annualized revenue numbers, kind of if you could just?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I will tell you, it's a sensitive matter for us. One of them is really a software business provider, and it's going to be married up with an existing situation. So it does tend to have extreme margins, and doesn't have as much revenue because its contribution margins are extreme. The other one, the Chouen business, when we put the two together we're talking about something that's going to have hey high, maybe twice Roper's EBITDA margins. And it's maybe going to generate $25 to $30 $35 million of revenue over the next 15 months.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia: Okay. Thanks very much.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Lots of cash, lots of synergies, okay.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia: Thanks.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: We go next to Alex Blanton with Ingalls Snyder.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: Good morning.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Alex.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: Just a clarification, you did $0.83 without that charge if you add the tax affected amount to the actual net income and compute it that way, it was slightly below that, but then you rounded up to 83. Was that in your guidance?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: The charge, no, what you mean the forward guidance?
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: Yes, the guidance you gave us in the second quarter.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: The 3.16 to 3.22 includes eating the charge of that $0.03.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: I realize that. But the guide answers you gave us at the end of the first quarter was 77 to 79 for the quarter.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We didn't know about that. We only learned about this in, literally the last week of June.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: Okay.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And I just can't tell you what an incredibly great job Neptune did, to take ten meters and recognize that it's actually a component problem and how it's going to have to be resolved.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: Okay. That's great. So you did $0.83 versus $0.77 to $0.79 anticipated, right, am I right?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I can't do that math for you.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: You're top in by $0.04 excluding the charge, that's what I am getting at.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: I mean is anything wrong with that way of thinking?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well listen, we're always instructed that we could tell you what the charge was.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: Yes.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And we can tell you what the shares are. But we cannot do a calculation about that number. So we're conservative about that, and that's why we didn't in our press release say that exactly what that was.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: I don't understand these knitty-gritty things, but. Look I understand that it's a.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: But we don't necessarily understand it but comply with them.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: Okay. Now, S&P on the ratings situation, S&P raised their rating 2, but you didn't comment on that. Was that because you didn't quite get?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, John, why don't you explain that?
John Humprey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure, actually with S&P we had an existing shelf out there, it was registered a while back at the time when we were a low-rated company, when we went to an unsecured facility for our credit facility. That required S&P to take a fresh look at the shelf. So they came out with their upgrade for that shelf. We remain at BBB minus with us a stable outlook with Moody's as we have been throughout the last nine months.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: So what is this S&P's rating on you?
John Humprey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: S&P is at a BBB minus with us a stable outlook, and Moody's is now at a Baa3.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: Okay. So the S&P is slightly below the Moody's?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: No, those are a 12 hour ratings.
John Humprey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Those are equivalent rating.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: BBB minus is the same as a.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: Got you, they're both investment graded?
John Humprey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Absolutely, yes.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: Okay.
John Humprey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: They're both investment grades.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: I'm not a born person, so just wanted to clarify that.
John Humprey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: They're both the first step into investment grade.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: Got you, okay. So Moody's went up to, okay.
John Humprey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: You have announced the third quarter debt extinguishment charge I think it's $0.02.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Correct.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: Well, that's not in your guidance.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Not it's not in our guidance. We view that as a non-cash administrative matter. And whenever we've had dead extinguishment costs in the past we've excluded it from our.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: Okay. So do you know if the analysts will include it or not, because otherwise it gets confusing.
John Humprey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I have no idea what they're going to do, but if our history has been and pretty much anybody I have ever seen and in debt extinguishment non-cash charges it's not included, it's just an extraordinary item.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: Let's hope not otherwise, we're going to have non-comparable numbers out there. Finally, the Mid-east project, you indicated that there was a 4% delta between including and not including in the sales, which works out to be about $20 million for the quarter.
John Humprey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That was actually a 2% delta, which would be half of the number you just mentioned about.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: I thought you said that was up 12% versus up 8%.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: On a reported basis our total sales were up 12%, but we also have acquisition benefit. So on an internal basis, sales were up 6. If you adjust for the impact of the Middle East tolling project, internal sales up 8. So the impact on the total company was 2 points.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: Okay. 2%?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: 2% on the growth side, yeah.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: That's 10 million for the quarter.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: It was about a $10 million delta year-over-year.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: Okay. So if I annualize that as $40 million, but I don't know if I can annualize it, because I don't if it was there the entire quarter, or just first up.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: No. You can't really annualize that number. It was kind of flat year-over-year in the first quarter.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: Yes.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And then it will be an impact in the third quarter as well.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: There will be an additional impact?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: A similar impact in the third quarter and moving into the fourth, it is not a full quarter impacting the fourth.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls Snyder: Okay. Thank you.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: We go next to Matt Somerville with KeyBanc.
Matthew Somerville - KeyBanc: Two questions. First back to imaging, Brian, what kind of average duration are you seeing in terms of these delays and I guess, right now would you say you have a little bit better visibility into the business and then just can you talk about how the performance of a medical pieces within scientific and industrial imaging segment have been performing and what the outlook is there?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Matt, let's do just medical first, medical continues to do well. They have a big trade show coming up here. They are going to be launching a bunch of interesting oncology support materials. That business is still growing nicely it has above Roper EBITDA performance, low asset base. They did have some difficulty in the quarter, because we have two facilities, one in Colona and one in Orange City, Iowa. The flood did affect them, didn't do any damage to the facility, but it affected people who had to deal with issues around Cedar Rapids and what have you. That will immediately write itself here in the third quarter. We weren't going to use the Iowa flood for an excuse for any of the certain margin deterioration we had. We still very much like that business. It's doing well internationally. We still think it ought to be a double-digit grower. We're talking about something in the neighborhood of $100 million of revenue in that business, so the reason we're so disappointed with imaging is when you have one of the most attractive business elements inside your segment and you still have deteriorating performance, it makes it frankly much more unacceptable. As far as the visibility, what's really happened to some very well intended people is they took a couple of their OEMs at their word and the OEMs got involved in situations that they didn't foresee. One of our customers, a publicly trading company laid off 60 people in the second quarter and it is very well known what kind of problems they're going through. One of the competitors I see that one of them has, I just got a copy out UK that somebody might be buying them. So I think there is a lot of activity in the space. I think that the margins would not have deteriorated if they hadn't spent as much money ahead as they did and Gatan moved out of it's facility to get completely integrated in another facility in Pleasanton. That drove up their costs. They did an unacceptable job in budgeting, and I think John and I felt that commitments were made to us weren't lived up to and that's why we took people actions there recently. I think as far as visibility, we're not worried about imaging having further deterioration. I think it will be flat in the next quarter. Hopefully it starts to get a little bit better, but it is a short-term drag on our performance and as somebody else said it's we're going to take a hard look at what we're going to do with that business. We're either going to reconsolidate that business or think about somebody else do it.
Matthew Somerville - KeyBanc: Okay. And then the other question is just around the Energy Systems and Controls segment. If I break the segment into buckets, you have instruments, control systems, the protective technologies and the Z-Tech power business. Can you talk about fundamentally what you're seeing kind of across those four buckets?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, frankly they're all doing really well. The Protective Technology business in terms of variable on effusion of revenue is leading the path. The sensor business is doing really well, up quite a bit in the quarter. So those two were at the high end, let's say favorable results and detracting compression, controls were sort of similarly up, detect a little smaller business and for us it's also actually out performed a bit more. The business that lagged in the quarter on a relative basis still up was our Petroleum Analyzer business, which had soft North American activity compared to what we would expect. And they're projecting a really, really strong second half of the year. So we see favorable comps in energy in Q3 and Q4.
Matthew Somerville - KeyBanc: The comment you made on M&A pipeline being relatively full, the transactions you're looking at, Brian, are they more along the lines of the smaller deals you closed on here very recently or are those things in the pipeline of historical size similar to the Neptune's and TransCores?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I would say the short answer to that is yes. But we look at over $5 billion a year in transactions. Now so far this year we've actually invested some real money. We don't think we're done this year, and some of those could be smaller, and some could be larger. I think what's really a little different, when we bought Neptune that was a very big deal because we had to spend over four times our trailing EBITDA to acquire Neptune. We issued equity and we issued a convertible secured. When we acquired TransCore, we still spend over 3.5 times our trailing EBITDA. At that time, we had to get the company debt rated. We had to establish all the relationships. We didn't have anything here prior to 2003. We put in place I think a world-class corporate team. And now it's really a sophisticated and straight forward standard company. It's an investment grade company, and that company is going to remain investment grade. To do that, it's not going to get a balance sheet debt to EBITDA situation like it had, that had to invest in to become a great company. So I think you're going to see us running at this kind of two and a half times debt-to-EBITDA, and you can put a pencil to that, and you can see what kind of capacity we have going forward. So we have a lot of opportunity, but we're not going to have taken four years to get this company into the status that it is squander that by making a big deal that doesn't fit our investment grade metrics. Now, we got a lot of opportunity foe that, and we also have some tangible assets. We may have been talking about one this morning. And if we cashed out some of our assets that were less happy with, we would have more powder to do a larger transaction. So I think I will stop there.
Matthew Somerville - KeyBanc: Thanks a lot, Brian.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome, Matt.
Operator: We go next to Deane Dray with Goldman Sachs.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Good morning.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Morning.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Couple points first just to clarify there was a question earlier about whether debt extinguishment is treated as one-time and typically it is treated as one time, so you're right on that, Brian, and, John, we appreciate that inclusion of core revenue growth in the release, so in fact we had to double check to make sure that really was a Roper release we were looking at because that was a new iron for us, I appreciate it.
John Humprey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Always trying to be transparent.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Terrific. Now if we could, I would love to get more detail around this manufacturing issue at Neptune. Just from your description it begs a lot of questions here to the extent you can, just take us through. What is this component? Why, is it not covered under warranty? Is it going to be litigation, a big recall or is this very contained at this stage? So if we start there.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: It's very contained at this stage. It won't be a big recall. The provider of this is a very large company with very deep pockets, and very deep personal reserves. It's quite clear to us that they are completely responsible for this. And it is exceptionally fortunate for them and everybody involved that we were able to catch this, because it's a component that would go into a significant number of our automatic meter reading devices. And the situation, it is a very in-expensive component. So we do some other business with this company, which gets to be larger in detail. But the problem is already known, it's already resolved. So it isn't getting worse, as we speak. So it's a finite thing involving a relatively small number of in-stock and installed devices. The bad news is that, you can't just pluck out the component. These things aren't that expensive in total. So we've got quite a bit of labor, and we talked about it here. It's actually because we learned about it in the last week in June, and people were continuously through the 4th of July to make sure that we understood exactly what it was and what the remedies were. We felt obligated to do book this. But I think the amount of money we booked is clearly adequate. Our responsibility for this we think gets transferred ultimately to the provider. They need to fess up and handle this as a warranty item for themselves in addition to a whole lot of other costs that we're providing. So it's not a product recall. It's something that can be fixed in the field, but unfortunately you don't get to walk into a plant. You have to go into the guy's yards, you got to open up his meter pit, got to make a change and the labor will be expensive, but parts are negligible.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: And just to clarify if you could, is this an electrical component, or mechanical component?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: It's an electrical component, and we would like to tell you what it was. We initially had that, decided I guess, we shouldn't do it because it wouldn't be that hard to figure out who the person was, the vendors ask to us work with them, so we're going to work with them. But they should do the right thing.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: It is your sense that charge as it stands today will adequately cover.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Absolutely. We've been through that. We took TW through when we booked it. Yes. We're very comfortable that that charge reflects the right methodology.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: And it's just your sense that this should be treated as a one-time item? Why is it not part of your manufacturing challenges and on a regular basis?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: The way we treat it is a reduction in cost of goods sold. We'll probably put it through the warranty reserve, but we don't think in fact, it validates kind of our reserved methodology, because we caught it so early, it's just a weird thing it is going to cost all this labor. I think each person has got it, we're not asking people to, but we believe it is a one-time item. But we didn't say we earned $0.83. We said we earned $0.80. So if people want to give us credit for that as a one-time item, we thank them very much for that but our guidance assumes when people don't give us credit.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: I understand. Thank you.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome. Okay. Rufus, we have time for one more question.
Operator: And that question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with Lehman Brothers.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Lehman Brothers: Good morning, guys.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Shannon.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Lehman Brothers: Yes, just a couple things. One more follow-up on imaging, just in terms of the actions you're taking and how you're thinking about it in the future? I mean it sounded like a lot of what was deemed up acceptable was kind of controller ship issues you made some of these people changes in the business. What else is there that makes you question whether you really want to this be a Roper business?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, it has been a frustrating business for us for several years, because we're getting up to the point where like half of our revenue is recurring revenue or subscription services and things like that, and the trouble with the camera businesses is it's always a new sale. It is always an application design. And it is always something the guy can buy a little bit later. Frequently its government funded, and you're looking for the Japanese government to spend money on research or you're looking for the US government. We get worn out with the excuses that we get from the camera people. They actually are always correct, okay? But investors don't reward us, because we can articulate what went wrong. They reward us for anticipating what can go wrong and taking action in advance. We've been too patient, too long with the camera businesses, and actually it's a good thing what happened this quarter, because we are no longer going to tolerate the kind of stuff that we have to live with. It's not going to happen in 2009 or ever again. And I think that everybody involved in those processes knows and understand exactly what we're saying.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Lehman Brothers: Okay, great. That helps. And a couple of things on the margins, you mentioned these industrial margins extra charge. Those are pretty wild with kind of contribution margins you put up there. I mean even though industrial has been tracking with very strong contribution margins as it is, that looks like a bit of an outlier. Was there anything unusual there in the quarter?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We had phenomenal shipments out of Neptune, all time record. So you got really good… I hate to use the term absorption. There has been a terrific, but everybody is doing well. We had one small business in there that's struggling. Our punt businesses are doing phenomenally well. Right at the moment this is the time you would say, wow, I really love our industrial business, what do I have to talk about all of this other stuff for, because we would be up double-digits organically. We have everything in the world looks wonderful, so everybody is doing great. We came off a two-day quarterly review session with them last Wednesday or Thursday and in Atlanta, and when we walked out I was saying to the guys, well, this feels more like a strategic review than a quarterly review. I can't explain about anything. We did find things, what I mean is they are really just knocking the ball out of the ballpark.
Shannon O'Callaghan - Lehman Brothers: Okay, great. I leave it at that. Thanks, guys.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: And that will end our question-and-answer session for the call. We now return to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humprey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. Well, I guess my closing remarks are to thank everyone for joining us this morning. And as always, we look forward to talking to you again in three months.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Roper second quarter 2008 financial results conference call. We do appreciate your participation and you may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Roper Industries First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. This conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator for today, Mr. John Humphrey. Please go ahead, sir.
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Anthony and thank you all for joining us this morning. As we discuss the results of first quarter performance. Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our first quarter financial results. The press release also includes telephonic replay information for today’s call. We have also prepared slides to accompany today’s call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website at www.roperind.com. Now, if you please turn to slide two; you will once again see our Safe Harbor statement. I want to remind you that today’s call includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page. Additional information about specific risks are included in our SEC filings. You should listen to today’s call in the context of all that information. And now, if you please turn to slide number three. I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, John and good morning everyone. Well, the next slide you can see just an overview of what we will talk about today and then get into Q&A. We give you a little discussion around the enterprise in total and then talk about first quarter results for the enterprise and the individual segments. We are going to update our guidance, talk about kind of driving forces that we see throughout the rest of 2008 and then summarize what we have done today. So, next slide. If we look at first quarter it was an all time record for us in the first quarter for virtually every financial metric we have with the highest level of orders, sales, net earnings, EBITDA, cash flow, operating cash flow, and diluted earnings per share. Our sales and orders were both up 13% in total, 10% of that was internal growth in both categories hardly benefited by 3 points of foreign exchange. The backlog in the quarter went up from $520 million last year to $519 million that $17 million increase in backlog in the quarter, means we should have a strong second quarter. EBITDA in the quarter was $134 million and EBITDA margins went up again by 50 basis points to 24.6%, which is an exceptionally strong way to begin the year. Our net earnings were up 24% to $64 million up from $51 a year ago and the diluted earnings per share number was $0.68 up from $0.56 last year. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $72 million, up from $57 million last year, a 25% increase. So, as first quarters go this was a very strong start for Roper. Next, in the first quarter we have made two acquisitions, the large one CBORD, which we discussed in our yearend conference call on February. CBORD has been with us in the quarter for five weeks. It is a leading supplier of cards and integrated security solutions for both education and healthcare. We talked extensively about it in the call and I have been reviewing it, as we have done investor conferences in the quarter. It’s a particularly good match for us, because it touches on a variety of markets that helps us expand our opportunities with our existing businesses, very synergistic with radio frequency. We will talk about that when we are in the segment. For us, we were delighted because they were in the process of changing their financial system at the time of the acquisition and all of that has been completed and the financial integration is really ahead of schedule. TechPro is a small company that we acquired in the last week and a half of March. It is a company that’s making test instruments and software for really the process industry. It’s in Akron, in Ohio where our Alpha business is, both of these are part of the Dynisco sensor technology that we acquired back in the December of ‘06. Dynisco is off to a good start with us and TechPro was a natural second bolt-on for that family of products. As you can see we invested $370 million in the first quarter and the fruit of that you will start to see in the second quarter. Next slide. Now we want to talk about the specifics of our first quarter for the enterprise. The income statement here next slide, you can see net sales went up from $478 million last year to $543 million this year. That’s a 13% increase. Gross profit actually increased, you can see from 49.8 to 50.9 demonstrating, I think the value of our products and services, the customers and market, where a lot of people are complaining about pricing. You can see we haven’t had to make much in the way of sacrifices. Income from operations went from 19.4% last year at $93 million up to $99 million this year, a 50 basis point improvement. And income from ops did a little better than quarter of the sales. Interest rates about flat to the prior year, our tax rate flat to the prior year. There are some people, who seem to think our tax rate is not 35%. I don’t know why? We said, we forecast, 35%, that’s our number that would expect on average throughput the year. Our net earnings, is $64 million up $13 million from $51 million. That’s an increase of $24 million, but of course CATZ took a penny out of our reported number. We would have been $0.69 without the creep in CATZ, which held us back to 68 over 56, that was strong start. Next slide, we would look here at the top line performance. Sales and orders we said are both up the same percentage. Orders of course exceeded sales and we had some benefit from really the strength of the Euro, little bit in the Canadian dollar, but some offsetting negatives on the cost side in the Canadian dollar. Nest slide; EBITDA, you can see we continue to grow EBITDA nicely. Our EBITDA in the quarter went from 115 to 134. I would like to remind us, that over the last trailing 12 month period, you can see a more reflective story of how we grow and we will continue to grow EBITDA. In the 12 month period ending first quarter of 2006, our EBITDA was at $352 million. It went up $97 million during ‘06. So, it ended the first quarter of ‘07 at $449 million trailing, and this year that’s added another $98 million of EBITDA coming from 449, up to 547 on a trailing basis and that doesn’t have the benefit of the pro forma, what we would have from CBORD added to it. So, our trailing 12 months EBITDA is up 55% in the last two years. Next slide. Cash performance in the quarter was really spectacular. Once again our asset velocity initiatives continue to bare fruit, you can see inventory drop from 9.7% of sales at the end of the first quarter a year ago, to 8.8% of sales this quarter. Our receivables are just slightly higher part of that’s the growth in the international activity and very strong quarter out of energy with longer international receivables. Payables and accruals were flat, so the net number comes down from 12.3 in the first quarter of last year for net working capital to 11.6 this year. And our operating cash flow increased by 25% from $57 million to 72 to come out with 72 in the first quarter at the start of the year, when Q1 were usually be a most negative quarter on operating cash flow was particularly strong. Next slide. Here if we look at the balance sheet, the financial capacity of the company. I think, it’s actually a stunning achievement because in the last 12 months we have invested $415 million in transactions with CBORD of course staying the biggest. At the end of the first quarter of last year our cash was $80 million, today our cash is $151 million. Our net debt has only gone up from 976 to 1.65 billion. Our shareholder equity is up well over $300 million. Our net debt to cap is actually lower today than it was at the first quarter a year ago, where it was 38.8 and today it’s 36.3. Our net debt to EBIDTA is lower than it was a year ago. It’s now 1.9 times versus 2.2 and that gives us substantial room to continue our acquisition program. And our EBIDTA interest coverage is higher 10.7 times versus 9.4 a year ago. Next Slide. When we get into the individual segment performance and we will start here next with industrial technology. The performance of industrial technology was spectacular. This is a business that had no acquisitions, so all of this was pure organic growth. Orders were up 14% in the quarter and sales were up 12%. We had strength in virtually every business. We only had one product line that didn’t register an increase year-over-year and that was a very small business. The quarter for Neptune set an all time record, not just a first quarter record for Neptune, but an all time record for any quarter in the history of the company on both orders and sales. So, for people, who were worried about the residential crunch, I would say that we have found the way to weather that storm pretty nicely. Growth in Mexico was particularly helpful in the quarter. We have a project going on in Mexico City, which is an interesting one for us. Niche Fluid Business these of really all of our field and fluid product businesses are performing at a high level. We have opportunities for pump in the energy segment. We have a Cornell driving really well with agricultural and wastewater projects and we have Abel driving well with mining projects in Europe and developing nations. And then lastly we have had a return to a build out for cold storage facilities particularly internationally, where our Hansen business has grown nicely in the quarter. All of those drivers, we think will continue in the next several months if not throughput the year. Operating margins reached a pretty spectacular number. This is not EBITDA; this is just pure operating margin, up 140 basis points to 26.1%. The things we continue to do in ongoing operational excellence drive a lot this activity is does the leverage from the increased volume. And this goes into the headwind, so rising copper prices and cost push inflation for energy to run our facilities. So, I think the people on this segment really have done an incredibly great job. Next slide. Here we look at Scientific and Industrial Imaging. That is a little complicated story in the quarter because we have exited the Motion Imaging business. We exited with a minority position and so we can’t really put it in discontinued Ops. The reality is that, the sales were up 5% and orders were up 1%, but the fact that Motion Imaging is in the numbers from the prior year and not in the numbers this year, that had a negative 3% drag on the comparison on sales and a 2% drag on orders. So the segment, if we could have excluded that, it would be sales up 8% and orders up 3%. Internal sales were 6%, and internal orders were up 1%. We have a small acquisition we had last year called JLT, which added a little bit to the revenue. Our key drivers in the quarter, the favorable situation is our CIVCO, Medtec and FMI business continue to do very well in the medical space. They are growing at a double-digit rate. But the government research funding, both here in the US and some degree in Japan has continues to ride softness in the scientific camera business. And Microimaging, which is really a combination of powerful Gatan and Photometrics and QImaging enterprises and media software is rolling out a large number of new products, which have just hit the market this month and those things we think we will drive additional growth throughout the year, but actually the investment and launch of those pull down margins a little bit in the quarter. On the operating margin line, you can see we are at 20.8% above the 20% that we one of at a minimum level on imaging. So that was encouraging is up by 80 basis points from our yearend quarter. Medical did very well on an operating leverage, but the Life Science investments that we made in the Microimaging application arena partially offset the operating gains, we got from our medical platform. We expect margins in Q2 will be better than they were in Q1 and then in the second half of the year we will have some easy comps since we get rid off the problems associated with that. Next slide. Here we are looking at the radio frequency technology segment. Orders were up 17%, sales were up 13% and to understand how good the internal order growth of 10% is, you would want to go back and remember that in the period of year ago, we had the benefit of the growth associated with Middle Eastern project, which was coming online for the first time. The reality is that our revenue associated with that will be similar to what it was a last year, but it’s not in the baseline number a year ago. So half of last year’s first quarter internal growth came from the Middle Eastern project virtually, where this year none of it comes from that and yes we have got the same growth rate in the first quarter of this year essentially as we did last year. So, this is very strong internal growth out of this family of businesses and sales as you can see were also up. The key drivers here were excellent performance at John Simler in the ITS team. We were awarded a complicated and very sophisticated lane project in San Diego that people will be reading more about in the future. The Florida Open Road Tolling projects are moving ahead at a faster pace than expected and will help us have a strong second quarter. We had a number of wins in major projects around violation processing and customer service in the road design area. And then a very, very significant long-term multiple win in the Ohio Turnpike, which was not booked in the first quarter, will start to come our way throughout the year. Our Wireless Sensor sales in Inovonics continued to grow nicely, largely driven by our senior care applications and then CBORD, which only had five weeks of activity, as you might expect those first five weeks couldn’t be as strong as all the rest of the activity, if the seller wasn’t a stupid seller, but we have had a phenomenal beginning. CBORD was able to win Clemson University with about 17,000 students. That’s just been announced and that new product scenario will not only help us in growth throughout this year, but gives a long-term recurring revenue stream as Clemson gets build out. On the operating margin note, you can see it was 19.4%. That was really 20 basis points lower than I think the year ago number. That number will go up nicely in the second quarter and that was really because we had a disproportionate mix of tolling and traffic project work and what’s encouraging is actually positive is that the quality of the operating earnings we are getting out of those projects is substantially higher than they would have been two or three years ago. The CBORD margin improvement, which will be helpful it will start to kick in the second quarter. Next slide. If you look at Energy Systems and Controls another just spectacular quarter, sales up 23%, orders up 19%, internal growth here of 14% and 10%, very broad based across the segment. We only had one product line in that area that was go to flat to the prior year, everything was up nicely, double-digits as you can see. Zetec continues to perform exceptionally well with the Steam Generation Inspection technology we launched and the adoption of that around the world. And our Compressor Controls has did very well both in the Middle East and Africa in the quarter on a variety of Turbomachinery Control projects that are underway. And then we had in our Protective Technology arena for shutoff valves and pressure sensors, a very strong international growth and we see that continuing throughout the year. Operating margins were up 290 basis points in the quarter, 22% operating margins. New products that we were able to introduce in a variety of these businesses came in with higher gross margins than the products that they replaced and we captured of course the volume leverage associated with more revenue as well. We made a small bolt-on acquisition with the less than $10 million in the last week and a half of March. TechPro is a company, which is very similar to Alpha Technologies. Their primary focus has been on rubber and plastics industries on a global basis. They have got Alpha, a very nice installed base, lot of equipment, lot of software, lot of recurring revenue from people adding new applications. It’s a very synergistic for that business. New slide. If you look at guidance update for the company as a whole, next slide, you can see we raised the guidance essentially equivalent with what happened in Q1, we have expected return between 65 and 67 we earned, 68 we added the $0.03 to the bottom line of our projection raising the full year from 3.10 to 3.13 and the penny did the top line from 3.20 to 3.21. We established second quarter guidance at $0.77 to $0.79, which is up from $0.66 last year and we have raised our EBITDA from $600 million to $605 million that would be adding another substantial amount of EBITDA to the company. Net earnings will be above $296 million and operating cash flows likely to exceed $385 million or more. Next slide. If you look at something that I think its important for people to reflect on, we get the question about…how would we think about Roper in a kind of 2008 and 2009 period given what happened in 2000 and 2002 period in the basic industrial world. So once again, why we can’t think about, who we are and what we are today. Two-thirds of our first quarter revenue came from companies that we acquired since the middle of 2001, that’s two-thirds and that would be true with profitability. Today, where company whose sell why and share of activity is related to Water Metering and Usage Information to Radio Frequency Technology Applications and Solutions. The information around Freight Matching and Logistics for productivity, Protective Technologies for Sensors and Warnings Indicators and Shut-Off Technologies for peoples in a wide variety of industries. We have with CBORD the entry into a different form of Healthcare applications and Education markets. We have growth with CBORD and transport and several of the other businesses, now long-term contracts that are involved in annual renewals and subscription growth. We have a much deeper penetration in the international arena than we have ever had in Roper before it was a one horse … one-trick pony really with Gazprom. Today we have got, as we said last year, were 41% of revenue internationally and the international activity, we think is quite strong for us throughout the year as we built much better networks and access to global markets. We have high gross margins throughout the company, not dedicated in only a couple of spaces. We are no longer dependent on two businesses, that were really largely driving, the variance that occurred in Roper in the 1998 to 2000 period. We have a very strong balance sheet. We accessed debt markets in a way that’s useful for us instead of having constraints around the company and the way it was financed previously. We have a very disciplined acquisition process its produced one set of victories after another and most of our businesses in really strong secular growth markets. And the applications that we have in those markets, really dominate the company’s end-market behavior. So, we don’t see how you can look at 2000-2002 view of Roper and whatever happened to Roper immediately thereafter and draw much a conclusion about what would happen going forward. It’s a very, very different company, much more secular in nature. We have said consistently, we expect to grow 1.5 to 2 times GDP and out perform that in every instance and then we said we ought to really grow at 5% or 6% or perhaps more in a no-growth environment. And here we are growing at 10%, albeit 3 points is coming from currency. So, 7% in no growth environment. So, we think the company’s end-market activity and strategies are really paying dividends now. Next slide: Here if you look at the conference call summary, what we think we reviewed here today is that, the first quarter was a historical record for us, for the first quarter. Every financial metrics; order, sales, earnings, EBITDA, cash flow and diluted earnings per share were records. Order strength was virtually across the board. We had only about two businesses that were flat and one was down, very strong growth. International sales growth continues to build momentum and it gives us a lot of confidence in the balance of 2008. Our Neptune orders and sales established new records for this quarter, which really gives us a lot of breathing room for the second quarter and beyond. TransCore’s growth has been maintained despite the fact that we have an exceptionally difficult comparison because of the Middle Eastern project, which added about, 1 to 1.5 points of total growth last year for Roper and half of the first quarter growth for Radio Frequency. Energy Systems’ growth is expected to continue throughout the year, in fact it could accelerate in the second quarter. CBORD is off to a very good start. The Clemson University Award is a very substantial win at the expense of a publicly traded company and a very large publicly traded company that was trying to keep this as a project, where we displaced two people that had been market leaders in the past in those category. The financial integration that we done here is ahead of schedule, and the business development, which has resulted in a lot different meetings in Colorado, in the New Mexico and globally around Inovonics of TransCore is very good. The channel access opportunity for us is good because we have a lot of parking control door openers that provide a real benefit for CBORD to get into university and multi-campus facilities that they wouldn’t had on their own and then we get more products to distribute through the CBORD channel. Our backlog at a record $590 million means we will have a very strong second quarter. We know we are going to have better margins in the second quarter, that we reported in the first and the pipeline for transaction is a quite good we have a lot of things that we think are very interesting and CBORD and TechPro really only represent I think the first two applications for 2008. So, we think we are poised now to continue to have very strong performance throughout the year and with that we would like to open it to Q&A. Question and Answer
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We’ll take our first question from Wendy Caplan at Wachovia Securities.
Wendy B. Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Thank you. Good morning.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Wendy B. Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Brian, when you were talking about the RF technology segment, you didn’t talk about Freight Matching this morning. Can you talk about how that this is going and since you’re expecting some nice margin improvement Q2 versus Q1 in that segment. Can you kind of walk us through where we were here in the tollway CBORD at first quarter? Tollway CBORD in Freight Matching and where you think will be in Q2 on a margin basis or profit…some relative trends?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, it’s certainly a Freight Matching. We were very proud last year that we see some fall off in the activity just because of what was happening in trucking. We didn’t really see that, in fact we expanded the suite of offerings people can buy and we were getting enough new subscription value that would offset, whatever shortfall we had in the number of drivers subscribing, that trends continued, Freight Matching is still fine. Our Logistics business is good. In fact we’re looking at some things in that space that are somewhat interesting. We don’t really see a follow off. The growth in that space may not be as robust as it was two years ago, but it’s still fully satisfactory. When you look at the tolling side of things, we’re going to have a strong second quarter in that area because of projects that Florida is expediting and moving up and some new winds we’ve had. The mix in the first quarter of road applications if you will, was slanted more to design and construction activity helping people with engineering oriented kind of applications and those are always little less good than the product sales. So, Q2 will be benefited by that. The amount of money that we continue to invest in the design for the Black Diamond launch of products there and Radio Frequency and it won’t really produce sales probably until the third quarter. So, that pulls us down. So, we actually we had a fairly strong number here at 19.4 and it will go up nicely in the second quarter. So, we’re not really seeing anything pulling back, I think what perhaps people want to reflect on and it’s hard to put everything out in press release, but that internal growth in RF is really quite good because its as good as last year and half of last year’s reason for growth, couldn’t reappear because of the Middle Eastern project.
Wendy B. Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Thank you very much, Brian.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Shannon O’Callaghan at Lehman Brothers.
Shannon O’Callaghan - Lehman Brothers: Good morning.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Shannon O’Callaghan - Lehman Brothers: Hey, Brain. So, on the comments around organic growth, obviously decelerating makes sense, but 7% still very good in this economy. Are there any pieces, either on the organic growth or margins or anything? In the past we’ve had Redlake or DAP or some kind of issue that’s kind of a drag or something you are not happy with? I mean, would you characterize, the growth in the margins… do you seeing the quarter is from, you happy with it or there’re anything that are sort of underperforming or is it just…a little bit of a slowdown because of…just obviously the nature of a flat economy?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, if we take that in two pieces, what I’d say on the margin side, again we would expect the margins that we had in the first quarter would be our weakest of the year. I don’t think we are going to have another quarter, where we are not well above 20% operating margins. Also, even at 24.6 for EBITDA, I’d expect that’s our weakest EBITDA performance for the year, and that’s going to up. So, we will be much stronger in the second quarter and I think we’ll remain strong throughout the year. In terms of organic growth, when you are acquisitive the company, which we are, we separate the organic growth, everybody can understands what’s going on with sort of the same store sales, but a part of our world involves bringing in new entrants to our family. We are not doing bolt-on acquisitions. The beauty of our cash on cash model is, we were able to reinvest in some very strong assets. So, you’ll see dramatic increase in revenue in RF in the second quarter, when we actually report some meaningful numbers. For, CBORD, be in a five weeks, it hardly anything, and we are going to have a very strong second quarter out of CBORD. I think the situation around…the only areas that we were frustrated with were the camera business such where basically the US funding is just not going very well with government related issues, in the Japanese thing isn’t marvelous either. Those businesses really need to have research funds because that’s pretty much what drive the end-market demand for them. They’re not a big part of the company, so they don’t have a huge effect when they get that, but on the other hand they drag down our growth. If we were knew those from the growth and all the rest of the businesses that 10% number or 7% number, whichever you want to use would have been certainly stronger. I don’t see that changing much just does it has…it gets a little better with these new products are coming in from Microimaging in Q2 and 3. They are expecting pretty strong up-tick orders. So, we’re curious to see how that goes will helpful and think will be pretty low in orders in the second quarter. So, maybe it’s a long list wanted to answer Shannon that I think that addresses, which you were asking.
Shannon O’Callaghan - Lehman Brothers: Yeah, that’s helpful, thanks. The other things is just on the deal environment and how you are looking for things the rest of the year, I mean of course we are starting to see more things come out of private equity you’ve mentioned in the past, you have a good relationship with private equity firms and if they’re looking to maybe de-lever and monetize some things you’re often and avenue for later. Are you seeing an increase of supply coming from private equity firms, you think its going to be an above average year?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, generally what we do with these peoples we talk to them all the times. So, I don’t think we saw really a shortfall in supply, but we are seeing a lot of properties and we’re having discussions about a lot of things. I think the issue is the expectation around multiples of the EBIDTA you’re acquiring or the nature of the business acquired and you’re getting a little more realism, but not as much realism as we would like in that category. So, there’re tends to still be kind of a bid/ask spread, but as the year goes on people, who want to monetize aren’t have a lot of other choices. So, I think that’s favorable for us and all the conversations…well the conversations we’re having now are not with people who are desperate, but people who realize we’re able to get stuff done, whereas other people I talk to maybe can’t pull the trigger and get it done. When you look at our capital structure with one times, the debt to EBITDA number and we’re going to start pouring out cash in Q2 and 3. We’re going to certainly be in the driver seat for that kind of activity. So, I would expect that this will be a robust year for transactions for Roper.
Shannon O’Callaghan - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Great thanks a lot.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay
Operator: And your next caller is Michael Schneider at Robert W. Baird.
Michael A. Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Good morning, Brian. Good morning, John. How are you?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hey good morning, Mike
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
Michael A. Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Very nice quarter and great momentum, guys. Brian, I guess the first question is just on RF and these multiple operations projects as you call. I guess this is the first time at least I recall you underscored the momentum in that business and I have been writing for a while about how large this opportunity is. What’s changed there? Is it the technology on your part or it is a change in view among your customers? Just some color would be helpful.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think two things, a little over a year ago we split the TransCore operation from its historical structure into two separate businesses. So, we have what we call commercial technology, which John Worthington is running and we have ITS, which John Simler is running. So, we’ve got a series of regional managers here in the US and broad focusing on the ITS’s activity. They are a very critical component for creating demand opportunities in the end markets, but they have a very clear focus on what they are doing and what kind of things we are interested in doing. We are also benefiting from a huge number of privatization projects that people are analyzing and studying, and we get the benefit of maybe helping people because we are pretty neutral in the respect for which one of maybe 50, what these public private projects are, the PPP things or PQ as they call. There is an enormous amount of activity going on in that area and I think we’ve designed quite a good business model to participate in that. Then on the commercial technology side, we’ve really allowed our R&D people to focus on a very clear pathway for product development, and complimentary products and services for people in the commercial RF space. So, I think that’s helped a lot. So, you get kind of the benefit of macroeconomics in the market place coupled with focus and clarity around what we’d expect and the margins we’d like to see in the area and the results is pretty positive first quarter and a very good remainder of year we think.
Michael A. Schneider - Robert W. Baird: And Brain going forward as this business grows, is it added into margins or does it pressure the segment margins and especially vis-à-vis the tag work?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, when you are selling tags it’s added to margins, when you’re doing the design work, its dilutive to margins, but when we bought the company it was… the design work was pretty dilutive now its much less dilutive. So, in this quarter, where you had disproportion amount of ideas activity, we were still able to report 94 and if we didn’t have the startup expense for Black Diamond it would have been better. So, we are comfortable with that, but we would expect this to be the last quarter below 20%.
Michael A. Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And regarding Neptune and ITT just held its call and they among others are talking about just a general slowdown or delay in some municipal spending vis-à-vis water projects. I’m curious what you are hearing from the field, obviously, Neptune had a great quarter, but is that market share gains that continued project rollouts that just have been underway and can you discern if indeed there has been hesitation on installation maybe on the day to-day meter business?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We are not seeing any delays, I mean as I said the first quarter we want to make sure people understood it, it wasn’t just a record first quarter. It was a record for any quarter in our history for orders. So, we’re just not seeing that, I think you remember it’s not the CapEx side of water activity. So, in fact, the Cincinnati project, which is one of the biggest ever was finished last year. So, people expected that the fourth quarter and certainly the first quarter of this year would be difficult comparisons. We heard that from everybody all the time and they are on, the difficult comparisons, but fortunately we have gifted people and they continue to deliver and we’re finding business that our people didn’t see this Mexico City project was also our finest. And so is the project out of country that’s going on and in fact much of the leadership team of that business is not in the United States today. So, we’re not talking about where we are and what we’re doing because we don’t want anybody to know, because I think we’re in places that other people aren’t seeing and that’s to their credit. Now, we’ve been cautious about guidance in terms of what kind of stuff we’ve been have because of the common sense of everything, you read the morbidity and the comments from everybody else about these spaces are pretty to accounting and we’re just not seeing that. I think remember we’re selling water meters and automated meter reading technology that produces revenue that’s somebody is buying for 100 bucks per unit. So, the payback is pretty strong, so we’re just don’t see any kind of pullback.
Michael A. Schneider - Robert W. Baird: And just final detail, can you give us a sense of how the growth rates compared between the barometer business and then the air AMR portion of that division?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, John maybe comment.
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, I do…Mike I think we have that, but it’s not at my fingertips. So, if okay with you I’ll follow-up with you on that.
Michael A. Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Great, thank you very much guys and congratulations
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Operator: Our next caller is Alex Blanton at Ingalls & Snyder.
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Hi, good morning.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Alex
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Good quarter. I want to just ask you for clarification on the order rate. When you say net orders, what do you mean by that specifically and you mentioned a 13% order rate of which 3% was currency. That seems to be net of acquisitions. Is that what you mean?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: If I understand the question our total orders were up 13%, 3 points of that came from acquisitions
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Yes
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: 3 points from currency, so the…
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: So, 3 points from acquisitions?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: And 3 points from currency?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Right, and 7 % organic.
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: So, 7% was organic, okay.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Right
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: That wasn’t clear to me.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Secondly, you gave a lot of information about CBORD in the previous conference call, so you kind of went over it very quickly this time. Now, it was in the first quarter from five weeks is that?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: That’s right, five weeks.
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: And you announced three months ago that you paid 367, it was a $367 million deal.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Right.
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Is that still the number we should use and can be subtract that form the 378 to get the amount you paid for TechPro?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think so, John you can?
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The 367 is what we paid for CBORD, there are some additional fees as you know there always happened with these types of transactions. Unfortunately we can’t do these without attorneys, and so some of those fees get capitalized as well. I mean the total fess on this deal were in the normal range 1%, slightly over that and so the rest of that is going to be TechPro.
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: The rest of…
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: So, if you take the 367, add a point to it, that’s going to be about $4 million of fee and the rest of it’s going to be TechPro.
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Okay. TechPro is really tiny?
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, less than a million [ph].
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Okay. Then could you just quickly go over the basics of CBORD for the benefit of people, who weren’t on the last quarters’ call to know what exactly what it is, relative size and so on, and sales?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. What we’ve said is, we project CBORD to do somewhere between $8 million and $10 million of revenue a month. I know in the first 12 months of activity, it would be of course modest at the beginning, but second quarter will be at those levels at least. In the rest of the year, we expect it to run in that kind of span. What happens with CBORD is, they should have a very big installed base they are in about 750 campuses and whole variety of hospitals 300 beds and above. And they have know that the kind of everything that what happened in the cashless area plus, all of the access for a situation. So, in a student based environment they’ll have one card in the wall, that will allows the person to get access to the dorm room access to other universities situation, paper trail or paper less trail less around what’s happening of the library and bookstore. They can use the card as a debit card to charge against up with preset amounts. So, you don’t have this ugly thing people see or people try to get the student in and have charges it for over running the credit card. It’s not that kind of thing. They get revenue by providing all the software to handle the cash register transactions of everything that’s going on here. We’re expanding it with our parking control applications from our Amtec inside TransCore. The hospitals situation keeps a trail with their suite of software run Nutrition Management, its actually a supply chain forecaster for food consumption. The type of things we believe, it allows a patient to where another person that’s granted a card access to various place in the hospital they can deal with the pharmacy, they can deal with new entrance, whatever it is, just a variety of things are going they’re sophisticated and instead of having some access control technology from a traditional company and enterprise software thing from another company. The University can windup with one kind of unique spaced environment around CBORD. It’s a whole suite of things that it can do. CBORD acquired a Diebold Access Control piece for these kind of applications, a couple of years ago. And it’s a business that from prior experience I know quite a bit about it. We have a wonderful leadership team at CBORD and they’re certainly off to an exceptional start. The business is about 50% recurring revenue from the software that’s embedded. It’s not sold. It’s rented for a year at a time and they have above 95% return rate on that. And then on top at about 30 more percent of revenue comes from those installed base people expanding their suite of activity and about 20% from new products. We expect the new product portion of CBORD will grow more rapidly than it did inside the business and then lastly CBORD has very substantial gross margins. It has essentially no assets. Much of its activity is prepaid, so it’s a very, very strong cash generator.
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Okay. That’s great and so I take it five weeks would be around $10 million in sales I think.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, the first quarter would be the low point. It’s less than that. You can kind of figure out the math. It’s closer to $8 million for the stub period in the quarter
Alexander M. Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Okay. Thank you.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Operator: Our next caller is Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Good morning.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: My first question is more of an observation. You remember last quarter you provided a slide that was actually very insightful regarding your book-to-bill and how it tends to stay towards 1.0 and with only occasional deviations from that and it worked out to the decimal point that you’re hitting 1.0. So, we’re back to mean reversion, which is pretty positive. And Brian you made the comment on the up-tick in gross margin that you’re holding price. Can you give us a sense of where you’re getting price and out of that 7% core revenue growth how much of that was price?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I mean, that gosh…we do this with our field people all the time, I mean it’s a joke of course is that it’s just in the mix I mean. We have such a wide variety of businesses, gross margins could petty widely varying and it would be just very, very difficult. There is no standard products in almost all the businesses. So you windup with so many application possibilities that trying to track the absolute price is a hopeless task, but in Energy, where we had this very, very strong improvement, a lot of that is our petroleum analyzer work, in Lauda in Germany and Verson in France, lots of new products, lots of new applications just came in with higher gross margins than the things that they were replay. So, we have quite a sophisticated and diligent situation around how we look at R&D applications. And people know pricing is important, instead of too many businesses, who build up the cost and put a multiplier on it…it’s what we do here. And so people know we are going to really disappointed if we are hearing something coming in less than a 50% gross margin. And so that’s sort an underlying base. I don’t how great an answer that is, but it’s the truth.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Well, when the guys come in with their budgets for ‘08, are you looking at how much of a price they are assuming for the balance of the year or you focus on?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we do two things here. We want to know what they are embedded thinking about prices and whether there is any erosion in any of the areas, and then we want to look at their direct material cost and do an exploded analysis about what’s happened on cost push inflation and whether we are get any reduction in material cost. So we do look at that. And I would say that the margin in Q1, the gross margins in Q1 were better than the plan.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Good, and then impression in your follow-up comments on your point that regarding the petroleum analyzers, we’ve went to some tradeshows, where you’ve got your equipment, the gas chromatography applications for oil and gas. Just give us a sense of where that business is today? What your leverages to the whole oil and gas cycle and where do you want to take the business?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we bought a company a little over year ago called AC Controls in Europe and that gave us a better access to this field of activity. And so we’ve been building that technology into some of our other brands and what we call packets, its really in four different brands, but we had simulated under one division. That business is performed this just kind of 15 plus percent growth arena for quite a while now. A couple of years ago the business was more dependent on self regulation for instrumentation sales that cycle of activities long gone. And so we’ve got a lot of applications that are going well, I would say that a lot of our growth in the future two or three years from now, is going to be in beverage and food service. Because we have split the business and with the product management function today, so our gas chromatography is one aspect of what we are going to do, but certainly not be only towards at work.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Can we say beverage and food is that on food quality and safety?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, in process, the bottling industry, there are a lot of things that we can do in there about what’s happening in the contents of what’s in a container.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: And should that we expect that would be bolt-on or will you grow…
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Its new product design that we have underway that we’re launching at a slow pace. So, we want to know more and more about what we’re doing, but its existing intellectual capital, we can deploy in these new markets.
Deane Dray - Goldman Sachs: Sure, thank you.
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: All right, our next question is from Jeff Sprague at Citigroup Investment Research.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Citigroup Investment Research: Thank you. I made it under the wire.
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. Well, it is better than being cut off in mid sentence last time.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Citigroup Investment Research: We covered a lot of ground, just a couple of things Brian or John. How do you feel about your ability to use leverage in this set of capital markets, in terms of, turns on your EBITDA, would you take it up to three years or so if the right set of opportunities presented themselves or…
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, it have to be pretty exiting opportunities, but I think we’re more likely to be in the 2.5 times to in 3 quarters times, but remember we generate a lot of cash. So if you think about our capacity here we are ending the quarter at 1.9 times, so you’re say 60 bps or more below or it you’d be. We got trailing EBIDTA 550 and you don’t have any pro forma number that’s released in there on CBORD. So, even if you looked at our guidance number for the year 605, you got a quite a lot of capacity there and then we reinvest that with the same kind of multiple. So, if we get $500 million or $600 million of transactions between now and the end of the year, we still have a very strong investment grade debt situation. So, I don’t see that as a difficult prospect for us.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Citigroup Investment Research: Right and then you hit Neptune quite a bit with Mike’s question, but can you give us a little bit of the sense of US growth versus the new opportunities non-US that you are…
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think it was about a third non-US, two-thirds US growth.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Citigroup Investment Research: And then, just finally, a lot of pressure on guys like GE Healthcare on procedures dropping off. You are not seeing any of that in your patient positioning businesses?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: You know what happened, we saw that in the fourth quarter because of confusion around what was being reimbursed, but our stuff is middle-level technology. What we are doing is, the reimbursement confusion is lifted from our services in the space. So, we had very strong order inflow in the first quarter, and we have quite a bit of international business in that arena, which is different than CMS scheduled reimbursement in the US. So there was some noise and it’s behind us and when we had our quarterly review with the medical guys, we were all extremely impressed at their enthusiasm and comfort level because they were worried in the fourth quarter of last year about all its noise in the market place. So, I think it is probably a problem for GE, but it’s not a problem for us.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Citigroup Investment Research: Right, thanks a lot.
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We got two minutes.
Operator: That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Humphrey for closing remarks.
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. Thank you, Anthony. And thank you all for joining us today. I do know there were two or three folks, who were still in the queue in terms of questions. I am sorry I have to cut this off at 11:00 o’clock. I will be available this afternoon for any follow-up questions you might have and as always we look forward to talking to you again in three months.
Paul J. Soni - Vice President and Controller: Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today’s presentation. We thank everyone for their participation. You may disconnect your lines at anytime

After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from the participants. Brian?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, John and good morning everyone. The first slide, just is a summary of what we will go through today, our fourth quarter highlights and then our full year results and during the quarter results, we will look at individual segment performance. We'll introduce you to the of the CBORD acquisition, why we think it's particularly successful one for us and then we will talk a little bit about our 2008 guidance and cover some information around sort of historical perspective. We've gotten a lot of questions over the last three or four months about what kind of performance would one expect out of Roper if there is this economic downturn and how can we look at 2001 and 2002 and coming out of that timeframe relative to looking at what we could be entering in 2008 and I think that perspective maybe helpful for everybody. And then, we'll sort of summarize what we said and get into Q&A. So with that, we could take a look at the first slide, which is how the enterprise performed in the fourth quarter. Here you see sales, orders, EBITDA operating cash flow, operating profit, net earnings and diluted earnings per share all reached the highest level of any quarter in the history of the company. We had internal growth of 14% on the sales side with about 3 points of foreign exchange and total growth including prior year acquisitions was up 20%. We ended the year with a record backlog, $532 million, which gives us continuing strong performance, which we are going to detail in a second, around book-to-bill ratios. You may've noticed in the first quarter on a nominal quarterly order rate, it was not a double-digit number, but that's really very misleading as you'll see. Operating cash flow was a $117 million in the quarter, which was really phenomenal 21% of sales. Our operating margins in the quarter were up a 120 basis points to an all-time high, up 22.1%. We generated a $146 million of EBITDA in the quarter continuing margin expansion with EBITDA actually hitting 26.1% in the fourth quarter and of course, the debts we've reported were $0.77 up 24%. Actually, it would be even a higher performance compared to last year's $0.62 because that included a decrement of a $0.01 on cash and a $0.01 on a higher tax rates. So, it's not hard to look at 79 versus 62 comparison there. Next slide; if we look at the individual segments, in Industrial Technology they had certainly record sales in operating performance in the quarter. Internally we were up 13%, driven again by Neptune's automated meter reading shipments and continuing production and very strong demand for an expanded of line of flow meters we've introduced recently. And then, strong growth in South America and Asia for a cold storage products that go out into the Hansen brand. Margins in the segment were up by 190 basis points, to 26.4% which we think is pretty strong performance. Our Energy Systems and Control segment which does get more and more like protective technologies as we have been saying, had a very strong finish to the fourth quarter. They were also up, with internal sales up 14%. We introduced a new jet fuel measurement products and a new line of gas chromatography products, which took off very well. Some of that from our AC Controls acquisition of not long ago. And then, our Process Weighing business which was bolstered by Dynamic and Hardy acquisitions, has performed very well with new products we have brought to the market. The protected technology solutions we have introduced for marine turbines has been very well received and has driven strong demand in the segment. Operating margin in the quarter was up 50 bps to 28.8% pretax with those favorable new products coming in at higher margins. Next slide, here if you look at Imaging, it did recover as we suggested it would. It made 20% pretax in the fourth quarter. Yes, internal sales were up by 9%. If you netted out the Redlake Motion business that we moved into minority investment and adjusted for that in the DAP shipment catch up, we would have been up actually 15% internally. We had very strong business both in Asia and Europe on our physical science side of the activity, but U.S funding for NAH project is still quite tempered. The DAP situation that we had last year in '07 of course pulled down earnings somewhat, I will talk about that when we get to the full year. It'll make a little easier comp for us in '08. The RF segment capped off a record year. We had internal sales growth in the fourth quarter of 17%. Our orders on a nominal basis were down 8% but all of that was driven by the fact that in the fourth quarter last year we booked our Middle Eastern order which was an anomaly. That project performed exceptionally well throughout the 2007. We got most of the installation work done, a lot of the operating activity and the adoption of tags and readers has come at a faster pace than originally thought. We got a project underway here in Florida with a open read tolling. That was instrumental and a number of projects in violation processing and administration, which drive long-term recurring revenue that occurred beginning in Q4. Our Inovonics activity around wireless sensor technology continues to grow as we look at more and more senior care applications for the wireless sensors products and we see that continuing strongly in '08. Operating margins in that quarter were up 320 basis points to 19%. And total EBITDA margins for the 12-month period came in at 25.7%. Next slide; if you look at the income statement for the fourth quarter only, you can see total sales were up 20%, 14% internal as we said. Income from operations was up by 27%. And then, the tax rate you can see was 34.9% in the fourth quarter versus 33.7% a year ago, which cost us a $0.01 of share. And then, the DAPs $0.77 versus $0.62 was held back a $0.01 on the caps amortization requirement. Next slide, here if you look at margin expansion I think, people keep asking me when this will stop. And as long as we continue to grow, we don't know why it's going to stop. This is really what we do here. We have a very disciplined governance process. We start with breakeven analysis on each one of our businesses' product lines, customer performance and as we grow we capture more of the contribution margin out of each one of those products. You can see, we did hit a record Q4 performance of 22.1% and we also like to see how we're doing on a trailing 12-month basis and here you can see, on a trailing 12-month basis, it was 20.9% going back to a year ago that number would have been 19.9%. Next slide. This is a new slide. We haven't shown you anything quite like this. You may have done some work thinking about that on your own. This is book-to-bill understanding about how things work here. What this graph shows is that if you look at... set for line at one and say, if you were up or down by 3% in a quarter, what it like and what that does it's almost all these captures what will happen. So, occasionally you will have an outside order. During this more than three-year period, you will see there have only been two times in that 3 plus years that we have been out of the book-to-bill ratio contained within a 3% spread. One of those was the third quarter of 2005 when we booked a substantial project for TransCore in Memphis and in Virginia. And then again, we had the fourth quarter of 2006 where we booked the Middle Eastern project. Other than that, you can see it's a pretty common situation that we will book in the quarter relatively what we will show. Our business is generally now run on a two to four-month cycle time. We have lot of recurring revenue, people don't pre-order. We have channel stuffing. There are no dealers that are handling substantial quantities of inventory for any of our product lines. And so, occasionally you get the one-off project. But when that occurs in the fourth quarter it may look like our bookings were a little soft compared to prior period, but in reality are book-to-bill ratio for the fourth quarter was a solid one and we don't see any reason to be concerned about that. Next are we will get into the 2007 full year results. Next slide. Here if we look at the income statement for the full year, you can see sales reached $2.1 billion. Last year, at the end of the year, we said, we thought we might have an outside shot to get to $2 billion and we actually got all the way up here to $2.1 billion. That's up 24%. Our income from operations was up 30% and the DAPs were up 26% but cash throughout the year took away a nickel of that stated performance. If you added that back, we would have been at 273 and up even more strongly. Next slide. Here if you look at margin expansion just for a minute, again I think, it's important for investors to understand how our discipline drives this margin activity. You can see gross margins in 2005 were 50%. In 2006, they were 50.6% and in 2007 they were 50.4% and that includes bringing on board some business with lower gross margins at the beginning and yet, while gross margins only went up 40 bps during that two-year period, our EBITDA margins went up by 210 bps. That demonstrates a couple of things; it demonstrates our ability to hold the line on pricing and it demonstrates our operational execution capability, as get better inside the high gross margins that we have. Next slide. We had very compelling cash flow last year. It's something that people feel quite good about it. It was a major focus because frankly we were a little bit unhappy with the working capital management in the field in 2006 and it was a very strong focus for operating guys this year and they certainly delivered, you can see that. In addition to driving up EBITDA performance that working capital really help pushes into a phenomenal result here on operating cash flow at $344 million up 31% from the prior year. Next slide. If you look at how far we have come on cash generation and working capital, I think, it speaks to our governance model and how our folks really do pay attention to what's important. When we started this process to get inventories down and receivables down and payables up, you can see in October 31 of '02, which was fiscal year end close for 2002, inventory was 13.2% of sales. This past year on December 31st, our inventory was down to 7.8% of sales. Our receivables has dropped from 20.8% at the beginning of this journey the 16.1% and our payables and accruals when you net those against, you can see that the net working capital number dropped from 18.9% to 10%, that's a 890 basis points improvement over this five-year journey and what that means is we need $200 million less investment that generates the level of sales today that we would have, if we had not made these improvements back five years ago. And then, people see the improvements as you did in '06 and say, wow you got the net working capital down to 11.4, it will surely stop there, and of course, it doesn't because of the way we measure, the way we help, the way we guide and how well our people performed. So, we picked up another 140 basis points in 2007 and we still think there is an opportunity a little bit more on the receivable and a little bit faster turns in inventory. Next slide. In terms of individual sector performance, here you can see across the board we had very solid contributions from everyone. The RF segment came in and these are all rounded numbers at 26%, actually moving past Imaging, which dropped in the last at 24, industrial at 30 and energy at 28. And then, Roper where we consolidated all the corporate expenses came in at little about 25 as you know on 50% gross margins. First segment we look at today is Industrial Technology. In 2007 our revenue was up 17% and industrial technology orders were up 8%. The RF integration activity around automated metering at Neptune certainly was a major contributor to that it's at all-time record here in '07 and we continue to gain share not only in the automated meter reading but frankly in the core of water meter business itself, in both commercial and residential applications. We converted to direct sales force for strewer [ph] and some of the other material handling businesses and that drove added growth this past year and we think positioned us well for the future. And then, we had strong growth in agricultural and industrial and gas fluid handling end markets, pretty well across the board in each one of those businesses. We had particularly strong growth in our ammonia cold storage safety technology from America and Asia where there was substantial expansion of our cold storage activity and then we had something that was particularly heart warming occurring late in the fourth quarter as carry over well under the first quarter, we got a first real sizeable international order for Neptune products that we have been working diligently at and Chuck and the team they have done a terrific job and those shipments will really help bolster our first quarter and should offset whatever softness we might see in the residential market. Operating margins in the year were up 220 basis points to 25.6%. We are particularly proud of how well Neptune perform in the face of very strong cost/push inflation out of the copper going into their meter products and all of that and more was offset by reductions in our electronics and in factory throughput capability. And then, customer intimacy and cost discipline really improved margins in everyone of the other businesses. Next slide. If you look here at Scientific and Industrial Imaging, you'll see that for the year sales and orders rose up 11% and that was in the face of difficult period at DAO as you may have remember what the touch-screen problems we had from a vendor. And then of course, the moving out of our Redlake motion business. Key drivers were really physical science products that went into the Asian and European markets. U.S remained weak with poor funding out of government research avenues. Market demand did drive double digit growth in our medical business for infection control and biopsy systems. That would be Civco, Medtec and SynMed. Margins for the entire year came in at 19.5%. I suppose we could have rounded that to 20 we have attempted but it was 19.5. And that was pulled down a little bit by Redlake Motion exit costs and substantially by the DAP problem which is now behind us. We did get back in the fourth quarter to 20%, which we indicated we would on our third quarter call and we took some pretty aggressive actions here in '07, and I think you will see the results of that in our margins in '08. Next slide. Our Energy Systems and Controls business was up a modest 52% as you can see in orders of 50% sales. They of course, were benefited by a series of bold-on acquisitions and the outstanding performance by Dynisco in '07, which we acquired in '06. We pretty well did everything we said we would do in Dynisco. We brought in a world-class business leader into that business. In our view, it's got off to a very good start and we have a lot of opportunities. The other acquisitions in Protective Technology have actually outperformed our first year goals and are helping us achieve kind of guidance that we have laid out for 2008. The shutdown controls that we have launched for diesel engines have been very successful and the sensor technology and process weighing we are doing for people to assure themselves that their asset optimization and waste containment and spoilage and the things that they need to see for controlled technologies are working well. And we introduced some new products into the hydrocarbon analysis business and the gas chromatography business that have performed well. Margins in the segment, which includes the acquisitions, which of course come in generally at lower margins. Margins still have 24.5% for the full year and that includes $8.3 million of non-cash amortization in there. If you add back the non-cash amortization, then you will see the margins were substantially higher. And the improvements continuing in the acquired companies, as a family they came in at about 24% EBITDA and about 16% pretax. So if you adjust for that you will see that the underlying core businesses all had the record performance. Next slide. Just to remind us of the protective technology acquisitions that we made, which are part of the 474 million of investments in the last 12 months that include Roda Deaco and Hardy Instruments, Dynamic Instruments and DJ Instruments. Those are all performing as we indicated they would and we think they're going to perform a bit better if you are in '08 coupled with the CBORD numbers that deliver really excellent results against our purchase multiples. Next slide. If you look at the RF technology, this was up 21%, orders were up 13% on an internal growth basis, sales were up 19% and orders up 12%. A big driver of that of course is the Middle Eastern project, which actually came online faster than some expected. We got more reader shipments in country due to faster installation and the design execution and the initial phase of operation has produced a series of follow-on orders as tag shipments have exceeded peoples' expectation around the adoption of the usage of those in country. We also had very strong replenishment and upgrade of our ego tags in the North American market and then the freight matching business expanded throughout North America, both Canada and the U.S as a 360 Program that was launched, performed well and people added services to their underlying suite of products. And lastly the Wireless Sensor business performed well as we found new applications and new outlets OEM arrangements. Operating margin as you can see for the year was up 340 basis points to 20.7%. We got certainly leverage on an outstanding mix of product and improved better in our non-product portion of activity around basically subscription services that we do for people and those came in at higher margins due to productivity increases. Next slide. If you look here at the acquisition process, it continues to add value. We're able to invest $474 million in the past 12 months. Those businesses are going to produce well in excess of $150 million to $165 million or more of revenue and perform at very solid EBITDA levels, frankly generally higher than the overall company. They all have the same criteria and if we look at the CBORD directly for a moment, you will see, you can check the box was an asset business absolutely. It has very unique business model, we will talk more about in a minute. A very low CapEx, certainly no need to invest more than 1% or 1.5% into the business annually. For us, immediately cash accretive. It's a terrific market structure, but one of the things that's phenomenal about this business is that with existing customers, we only serve may be 15% of the sweeter things that we can do for them, that's going to drive long-term revenue and the driving forces in these markets are all coming our way and today a lot of them are related to healthcare and university campuses, but they are whole plus of opportunities in other educational venues. Management comp notice is important to us, we have signed up a leadership team with...we are happy with the subordinates as they would be known and some marvelous group of folks with a lot of intellectual capital siding and I think another placements around the country. The incentives as always are linked to the commitments, people have made to us. That's a business that's going to do an excessive $8 million to $10 million a month this year and revenue and is going to do substantially more than that in 2009 with EBITDA performance well above $35 million next year. We are going to preserve core values in that business because we think they are outstanding but we are going to encourage them to invest faster to grow more and to reach out to international markets, which we have been successful doing. I don't think anybody thought, we will have the level of international growth, we have had this year and we will talk about that later, but yet we do have global reach. Our governance process are just barely underway. We have been at this discussion on acquisitions for months now and so that I know that all of the folks are implicate know how think it would feel. And we have committed to them as we would to you that this must have liked for being bought to grow and we will achieve that. If you look at the next slide just in sort of a one line quote for us, why do we love CBORD. The answer is for us it is a perfect match of security, healthcare and information for end users. But it's all hold together in one single integrated platform with an exceptional leadership. We have worked exceptionally hard to find people that get us into the educational markets, healthcare markets and people let that have a core desire to serve customers and those are very hard things to find and to find one team with both the products and the service mentality and softer capability and the reach in country and the desire to be worldwide is a unique gift and we were very glad to be able to pick up CBORD and make it now our third cash register, flat form for our customers it just a step of being transparent. With that I would like to ask John Humphrey to take you through some more details about the end markets of CBORD and how we see it fitting in to the enterprise.
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. thank you Brain. On the next slide talking about the CBORD group, just kind of what it does it's the leading supplier for integrated card systems, security solutions and food and nutrition management software, serving the markets to buy that Brian talked, their expensive software capabilities across the enterprise, very high degree of recurring revenue which I will talk about on in our future slide. And the experience leadership team really demonstrates the type of commitment and passion that we are all so share. It does have a 30 year history with long established customer relationships and offers multiple growth opportunities not only among itself but also with the application of other activities and technologies that we have inside the radio frequency. Providing channel access into those markets for TransCore and Inovonics and it will be able to help CBORD grow even faster on a global basis. You go to the next slide; talking a little about the university and college markets. There is some very good growth drivers here, in terms of increasing demand to be able to utilize this one card in the wallet idea, for all of the students and type of the members. To be able to utilize that now only for transaction services but also for other integrated campus wise solutions that's electronic access for getting into buildings or chemical labs or other recreation building facilities. So that single card will be able to migrate not only from food service and buying whatever the student might be on campus, but also allowing them access into the areas that are authorized for. There is growing discretionary spending both on campus and off campus use and CBORD has the unique ability to be able to take this close loop network with inside the university and be able to expand it into off campus retail applications as well. All really expectations for high-quality food service solutions type of software that CBORD has will really enable that. The CBORD solutions you can see at the bottom of the leading provider for this single card solution transaction services. And a food service management allows them to manage not only their own internal inventory levels but also provide better nutrition information for the customers. Next slide. The specifics around the card systems which is really the core of the offerings into the university market. It's the one card in the wallet that the student will be able to use to, really do everything they need to do during the today, whether its access, whether it is purchasing, whether it's understanding how and how where to go. And if we are able to take that as I said into our campus commerce through the student advantage and off campus advantage branch and in addition there are follow-on software and the other hardware sales so not only thus the card work, but also the integration with locks and integrated security which include video and integrated access solutions. All under the brand name that you can see on the CS Gold, CS Access, and OdysseyPCS, it is used not only in university situations, but also in any type of large multi-facility or multi-access point campus solutions like the aviator sports and recreation which is up in the New York area. Moving to next slide, the same solution works very effectively in the hospital and manages care markets, where you have some of the same types of growth drivers where aging population is leading to a more managed care facilities and nutrition services are becoming a very important part of the treatment. In the food service management and the ability for customers in that environment to know exactly what nutritional information they are receiving and have been able to do that in a very seamless way. It's an important part of what CBORD will be able to offer. CBORD already has 1700 major healthcare licensees and are serving the half of the hospitals with over 300 beds in the US. However, that shows that number of the facilities that are utilizing CBORD today and as Brian mentioned, very few of them are taking advantage of the full suite of services that CBORD we will be able to offer. Next slide, as you can see on the slide 27; this is really a blue chip customer based major leading universities, some of the best hospitals across the nation and other campus and food service locations. Suffice to say that the customer diligence here was quite easy to perform and types of customer satisfaction rates is not something we see very often. And then finally on the next slide, it's only a unique business model that's been the improvement over a number of years. It's a very high-degree of recovering revenue. In fact, about 80% of CBORD's revenue is generated from existing customers every year with the substantial portion of that being annual prepaid subscription fees, so they can continue to utilize the software and services CBORD is available and provide for them and to make their campus lifestyle much more enjoyable and then along with that of course we're able to expand the suite of services and additional applications for those exiting customers. And the customer attention rates here exceed 95%. Once CBORD has a customer here with the customer satisfaction in the Integrated Solutions there is a very a high degree of the recovering revenue that's pretty notable. We don't employ asset like business and with the prepaid subscription model as that's the very good for working capital. Working capital is extremely low in fact pretty minimal rounding to a very small number and capital expenditure in the 1.0 to 1.5% of revenue once again picking off one of the key criteria that we look at. And EBITDA margins above the Roper average and as Brian mentioned, there are multiple growth in the market solely in expanding with healthcare and universities, but also looking at international opportunities. So, with that Brian, back to 2008 guidance.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, thank you John. So we go past 2008 guidance slide. First, with below our historical perspective about trying to answer questions people had about so, you know I read people talking about how Roper will perform in 2007 to '08 based on what is, what it might have done in 2000 and 2001 and I just want to clarify few things about the company we are today, you know, the vast majority of our business is coming from secondary growth in water and RFID, in security and software applications, recurring revenue business models that really off set much of the risk to the economic downturns. In 2001 and 02, Roper had 10% of its total sales coming from Russia and those were at extremely high levels of profit contribution. Today that is a totally de minimis activity. Second big contributor was semi-conductor capital spending around water resist pumping technology, as people building out the industry and you have also the automobile motion photography business which was primarily domestic market, neither of those who material in any way to the enterprise. Our asset velocity in 2002 was 18.9% of sales. Today our asset velocity is 10% of sales. That freeze up a lot of case and also equally importantly, they are not going to have inventory risk not going to have any kind of adjusts that occur in situations where you had been operating in a different kind of a business system and we really transform the company during these periods back in 2001, ISO is a holding company you know, at more into little more of an operating company is we created a it segment strategy and then it went into the market driven industrial. We are proud that the things we bought today is truly a diversified growth company and it has pretty well eliminated the older cyclical risk that people associated with Roper to suggest that whatever it is today has some relevancy to what it was five years ago is that do not really understand what the company is now. The next slide, if you look at the historical perspective around Roper, you'll see the key changes in driving courses for the enterprise today, almost all of which didn't exist in 2001. Today you have water metering and usage information and collection, you have RFID technology application and solution at the high end of the market. You have great matching and logistics that have to do with asset protection and utilization. You have protected technologies that are protecting and awarding people about their asset utilization, you have long-term contract with renewables. CBORD alone we expect to have over half of the business, the sample subtraction and renew. Patient positioning that has little or no risk CMS reimbursement issues, you have a very good reverse international business. I think people have not focused probably are found on house to home owner international business, because people ask me too often but it is all domestic now with Neptune and TransCore. What part may are international sales in 2007 were $859 million, 41% of total revenue. I would continue to have high gross margins of low CapEx and we have a very strong balance sheet. Next slide, if you look at how our position going in, we have got industrial margin performance that we believe the gains we made this past year will hold and could actually improve. Our international sales for water meters will actually have an impact to the first time in the history of Neptune's activity and are going to help us offset any weakness that might occur in some of the residential markets although we have seen that effective with the business in any measurable way. We have growth in our recently acquired protective technology businesses that is going to add the EBITDA performance in '08 and then in future. Our Compressor Control business which separate goal period of service revenue has slowness back as current fourth quarter it is projected to do well in '08. Our Z-tech business, which launched new nuclear testing platforms last year continues to grow nicely and is well at the front of the curve for activities that is going to occur there. In our energy businesses in total, for the first time entering a year we actually have a complete absence of negative usually. There is one at the businesses that will have some kind of headwind or something and at the moment, none of those businesses have any headwinds they have strong backlogs and have a very strong projection for their performance throughout the year. And we continue to see both of our opportunities both in the energy and protective technology reason and in surface and you can see an improving climate for acquisition total. Our next slide, if you look at our Imaging business it has easier comps in '08 because of the Redlake loss has been behind and then the key four margins they got back to a more acceptable level, will easily be maintained in '08. Our view should it back through, we have growth in the security camera and teleconferencing activities we have been doing the teleconference with 20 people to follow we are going to add opportunities to do that in another venues. The RF opportunities continue on our Middle Eastern projects is that continue to build out at a faster flip than originally thought. Our CBORD acquisition gives us tremendous new capabilities and channel access to markets, we couldn't have got to without to, our leadership team like this and an install base like to have. And our Rugged handheld application business, which JLT in the new technology we are launching and Black Diamond has growing applications. So, I think we are going to be able to expand beyond kind of FedEx and baggage handling into some other exciting area. And the acquisition update we mentioned are continue to approve and well pricing, we think is not as just as it should be for the Credit Suisse you can see things move in our way pretty quickly. Next slide, on 2008 guidance, here we established DAPs guidance here at 310 to 320 for the year up from 268 which was the year end number this past year, and the EBITDAwe think will exceed $600 million for the year, net earning will exceed $294 million. I am aware of focus just for a moment about the depreciation and CapEx, because our operating cash flow as you can see we are guiding will be an excess of $130 million of net earnings. The reality here is that occasionally people say Gee, that they would not spend much money on CapEx. Well, it's not true, we don't need to spend money on CapEx, our CapEx as you can see in 2006 was $32 million our depreciation was $30 million. In 2007, depreciation was 32 and CapEx was 30. We are going into this year thinking we'll probably have depreciation around 32 million, we probably have CapEx a little less in that. We simply don't have a business model its first talk America with vertical integrated factories that had whole lot in their business. What we have is a wonderful business with whole lot of EBITA. And that intangible amortization and non cash expense has a heckable lot to our operating cash flow and a free cash flow at the enterprise. This is an outstanding business model going to ten yearly progressively up. Now in summary, what you have our actions would have been taken in 2007 and investments made to position us extremely well for 2008. We have a record backlog as we entered the first quarter. So, we think we will be after the fast start. In the past 12 months, we have deployed $474 million in capital. In transformational deals for both protective technologies and RF segment and that is really an amazing breakthrough because its all have been funded out of free cash flow and our strong balance sheet. We are in a situation if you go back to December 2003, when we made our investment in Neptune, we paid $500 million. We had the issue of equity, we had the issue convertible securities, we had the issue of public debt and we had to completely recapitalized the enterprise on the debt side. In December of '04, we invested $600 million in TransCore, we had to issue equity again, we had to completely refinance the company on the debt side. Here we have completed in the last 12 months of nearly similar kind of investment 474 million and has not had to do anything in the way of equity issuance or anything in the way of convertible debt. And we are in a marvelous situation today with our on going balance sheet. If you just think about this investment which occurred on Wednesday for $367 million, it has a benefit of $23 million tax benefits such as net of debt you are at $344 million and guess what our operating cash flow for the year was $344 million. So, we like where we are. We think we have achieved a lot for our investors, we think we're going to continue to achieve a lot. The significant reductions we got in networking capital and operating margin expansion drove that cash flow and our international sales grew 41% last year. So, we are in a global business here. We went up from $610 million in '06 to $859 million a 41% increase so it happens also be about 41% of total sale. The U.S sales grew 14%, we expect record performance in '08 with over $600 million of EBITDA and 130 plus cash conversion and with that we will open into question.
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Cynthia are you there? Question And Answer
Operator: Are you ready for questions, sir.
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, we are.
Operator: Very good. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Christopher Glenn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co.: Thank you, just want to follow up on the international team, little bit. I think three things that's stuck to me over the prior year you had the Middle East project in the tolling and recent press release on electronic equal registration Bermuda and today you mentioned the first international deal with AMR I believe, so that mean what kind of signals with those on traction and streak credentials per really showing those, those pieces a little bit that's how international?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well. we didn't really say anything about America we talked about Neptune business and water meters.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And that's not automated meter reading, we are actually talking about installing water meters in residential mode and it may made well include AMR technology associated with it. But its not necessarily being met with the AMR technology one its own. It's an integrated kind of a business. I think that when you are taking business more into global venue and takes a time to build scale and what we do is we have the ability to get people in front of the right individuals. We have the ability to add scale increasing to what anybody is going to do and its always is easier for somebody with a $5 or $6 billion market capitalization to come in and talk to foreign country about what there is smaller entity is going to be able to do to sustain itself. It can do usually do better job on working on letters of credit and sophisticated contracts and local service. So, the growth in our international business was strong in the year prior, if you excluded those growths, you still have very substantial growth across the board and in our businesses we have wonderful international based operation businesses that continue to grow nicely. I think that our growth focuses a core competency throughout all the businesses we have and the various its going to point to pop-up in an area you don't know. We are focused on all of markets that we can get access to with a right kind of product mix. It so happens that you had a very strong international performance last year. And because we don't tend to detail where everything is going everywhere, we probably have under educate people on the strength of our capabilities internationally. That's why I wanted to cover it in the summary today and read it in the K when it's released, but it that... probably deserve the conversation we created.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co.: Andwhat are you seeing in terms of the market ability of electronic vehicle registration in the U.S.?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well we think its time has come but we are a provider I think its going to have an exceptionally slow growth execution process there is a lot of forces aligned against it we work hard to try to demonstrate how valuable it can become but there is no application in the U.S. today for electronic vehicular registration in the context we are doing in some other parts of the world.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co.: Great, thanks very much.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Welcome.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Michael Schneider with Robert W. Baird, please go ahead.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Good morning guys and congratulation on a great quarter in year again.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Mike.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Maybe we can focus on Neptune for a minute and stick with this international theme but... it was my understanding the reason they had not gone overseas was principally because of differences in code specifications and measuring our measurement units etcetera, can you describe and I guess what's going on in the product design or adoption it really what is the market size or can you address the global market or is it only English speaking and English measurement countries.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: The market globally have hasn't changed I mean you are right. If you look at Europe oil pressures are different they are lot more submetring plus individual residential, things like that this is a an application that we have been looking at for a while so there are pockets of opportunity where you have situations that are existing technology is exportable and we have been able to be successful recently in three of those but we haven't redesigned the product this is our existing product and our existing data capture capability getting applied to markets that I think people fortunately for us weren't focused on didn't realize we were there and after they matured a little bit it will probably talk a little bit more about it and why they were, today you couldn't say that we think Neptune is constrained internationally by markets that have different water pressures in different sizes and configurations but fortunately there are pockets of opportunity and we tend to be pretty good figuring out where they are and seeing what we can do in them and this is one in an emerging country that happens to have very solid desire for world class infrastructure and so we kind of participated in that strategy for them.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay and then as far the domestic market goes have you done any sensitivity analysis to Neptune disclosure as states begin run budget deficits now and just wonder 39 deficits right now what is impact is on just core meter spending and I guess what are the most recent trends?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well that the only place that we really stated the country that's that had measurable flow back in the state of Florida, there is some unique things going on down here but we have looked that at more than a 25 year trend of different economic down turns, Neptune never had our...a flat or negative number the worst case preferred three times in the last 25 years and it had 3% of revenue growth so you know they feel confident that they going to have another record year in 2008 they will get benefited from some of these international stuff, they probably as not a year they can grow at 10% if things continue down but I would better against them, that any body can do as they can.
Operator: We will take our next question from Jeffrey T. Sprague with Citigroup Investors Research. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Citigroup: Hi good morning everyone?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi good morning Jeff.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Citigroup: Can we quick really a little bit more on CBORD certainly looks were unique from our return stand point while it does I guess part parcel is that kind of out side kind of that window EBITDA multiples you use to talk about just on some rough map based on what they said?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: No its pretty high margins business Jeff. We are just not get too specific about that and then and it is something we have been working on for months and it has you know, some unusual synergies for us with existing businesses, so it is it certainly at the high end as any multiple we have ever paid but its...its well worth it because of the cash it generates and the growth it has.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Citigroup: You just to be clear do you own it as if Wednesday or you?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. We closed Wednesday... we close Wednesday when we issued two press releases, that was just so I mean so closed, literally we paid the cash on Wednesday it, So it is a Roper business effective today and it will generate you know we tend to look at first year EBITDA performance it because, trailing multiples and adjusted EBITDA are properly lot of difficulties particularly when you are working with, with our friends in private equity. This is a business its going to generate over 35 million as EBITDA in 2009 and its going to grow nicely. And you know, that when you look at the fact we're picking up to $23 million tax benefit against the $367 million purchase price, we will have a cruise over time, I still going to come you know a fairly nice pay so it fits within our you know is not paying over 10 times next years number.
Operator: We will take our next question from Wendy Kaplan with Wachovia. Please go ahead.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Thank you, good morning.
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, good morning.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: And I guess, CBORD is the most important question to be asking this morning and we seem to be a little live on details, is there a reason for that?
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, it closed Wednesday and you know, we are riding welcome to Roper letters and the press release side what details would.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: So, I guess in terms of, it sounds from your comments so it's about a 100 and 120 million in revenue, is that right?
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think it will do that kind of stuff over the next 12 months it's current run rate is around 8 to 10 million.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And the competitive environment in terms of market position or shares?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: It is a strong when most people think about CBORD they look at another publicly traded company called Blackford. They resemble BBB and Blackford you can get some sense about how people feel about the multiples of that enterprise and what is worth, they are in all line of other educational aspect that CBORD's not in and CBORD are much more focused so they really are they would see each other occasionally on campus, but I think they, you know, we don't know Blackford well. I think they have their own unique business model what we see when CBORD is an opportunity to invest in the business from a growth perspective and to look at global markets and moving out on a variety of sweeter products they have to offer and by getting access to our engineering capabilities that exists in radio frequency and some unique things we're going to do with antibiotics as well sensor technology and CBORD's existing marketing plans and capability.
Operator: We will take our next question from Alexander Blanton with Ingalls & Snyder. Please go ahead.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Thank you. By the way as before I said, operator is cutting people off, not allowing them to have a dialogue receive.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I think Alex its two questions at a time and then I know that for back for the follow up.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: I went to the CBORD's website last night. It's very, very interesting and I recommend to look at it. On that site there is a press release in January 10, 2008, a new computerized campus exit into the CBORD and the itself is stale black. So that gives you the idea [indiscernible].for quite of few years, if that is the case that you have been talking with the people and thinking about this company and could you just give us a little background on that and lets move into business very, very well?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, it is a...you've certainly, you wouldn't be wrong about that. I do believe that CBORD had some relationships there. They have relationships with other people. Yes, I do know that company well because of that people that I know and you know everybody has always spoken highly at CBORD. I think that this is sort of what we do, we look at private equity, we look at things that private equity earns, we have kind of wish list around the assets but we I think eventually would become available, you know, we broke, whether they might be available. In this particular case I could tell you we had advisors work with us like Hal Rich, and Niels Nielson and they were close to the private equity people and were well aware that they were considering doing something. They had probably different ideas always these things are so attracted but would have been an easy IPRO wide range of things that I could do to private equity people to own them are very sophisticated folks and we got the wonderful door opening opportunity as a result of that and one thing led to another and today we are proud owners of what we think, we think it's a great company.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: But I wonder if you had kept in contact with these people?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: No I didn't, I do know people who did but no I didn't have any prior relationship with CBORD.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: And the second question is on fourth quarter orders, you said a lot about full year orders but not too much about the fourth quarter. I think it because of comparison sir or other difficulties that you mentioned in some cases?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well orders is not bad, there were up I believe 6% or something. They have pulled down a little bit because we can't really adjust for the red like thing, but the book to bill is really strong and as long as the book to bill is with the true... the way things go, you know, we are satisfied and so we wanted to talk about the book to bill ratio at the enterprise level so people would kind of get a sense of what is there because we had an anomaly there in the fourth quarter of '06 and we thought it needed to be exposed I think some people saw that comment around it this morning but we are not seeing any kind of major fall off in order flow in the company. So, frankly as we went through the planning process and we just had our strategic plan and kind of offsite with the board in January and as a different segment, leaders making their presentations and I think people felt strongly about our idea and I think that's reflected in the guidance we established for 08.
Alexander Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Thank you.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Welcome.
Operator: : We will take our next question from Matt Summerville with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.
Matthew Summerville - KeyBanc Capita Markets: Good morning, just couple of questions CBORD, Brian, how much of CBORD business would you say is hardware versus subscription versus software?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well the subscriptions review and the service related to are more over half the business, the hardware raised would be the least portion of the activity. CBORD acquired a Diebold's Access Control business for these kind of applications and haven't owned it very long and they are really improving that business at a very fast pace. So, may be a third.
Matthew Summerville - KeyBanc Capita Markets: Okay and then you have any sort of market breakdown for CBORD in terms of how much this colleges, universities versus healthcare versus some of the other markets you highlighted in the press release and then the same thought domestic versus international sales there?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: A very little international sales, I do have some in those countries that we mentioned in the separated dedicated CBORD press release, which you can see on our website. But the opportunities internationally, when we were discussing this with the board you know, it's our international folks on board. We have already started a process to look at some dialogue outside the country for these applications, that's where myself and others are well aware of opportunities, better if there. I think that the college, university piece, just in the swag as probably you know 60% to 2/3rd with healthcare being kind of being 1/3rd.
Matthew Summerville - KeyBanc Capita Markets: Okay, great and just back to Neptune, how much of their business in '08 based on your order flow you are seeing international, would you anticipate the non-US?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: That we take Neptune you ask, I'm sorry.
Matthew Summerville - KeyBanc Capita Markets: Based on the order flow you seen outside the U.S?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, what we have is a ... we have strong sales in the Canada, we have strong sales in the Mexico and now we have a unique relatively a meaningful sale into another continent that is in its early phases was significant shipments in Q1 what will happen to see that build up goes and how quickly these people can kind of simulate the meters regarding going country and do training and help the installation get going side, I don't know it's not going to be enormous, but it certainly not to offset what we might have thought was a little bit more risk in 08 now we think we have put.
Matthew Summerville - KeyBanc Capita Markets: Andthen just one quick question on TransCore and then I will wrap up. Outside of the opportunity in middle east and I apologize if you already hit on this but can you talk about what you are seeing internationally in that business and what other opportunities you see on the horizon there?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: It is the unique business in terms of it having public interest and the people not allowing us to comment on what we are doing where but I can tell you because of the extreme visibility of the application that's in place now and the rate which it's growing that we have a record level of inputs and other countries in the region and in the area and so we are certainly active with a lot of dialogue. I do think that it takes months, if not a year to get anything to happen as those things are on hold, but I know people are surprised about the speed with which we have executed this and the effectiveness of what we have done in a very harsh terrain. So it can only help where we are going.
Matthew Summerville - KeyBanc Capita Markets: Great thanks a lot Brian.
Operator: We will take our next question from Dean Dray with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.
Dean Dray - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Good morning, Brian I would like to hear some of the additional assumptions baked into your 08 guidance if you could, should you think its true why internal grow of assumptions for 2008 and maybe how you expect the US versus international script, would be an and how about a contribution from pricing. How is pricing looked in 07 and we do you think about 08?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think if you look at pricing, we showed the chart with a gross margin for the last 3 years which has been hovering between 50.0 and 50.4 so, we are not seeing difficulty in pricing we do certainly some bid work, all the time but prizing pressure hasn't been unduly harsh. I think that, we find it consistently we think we have a growth of 1.5 to 2 times in GDP but if you have a notebook economy, you are simply going to through in mid single digits at 6% or more and totally even if there isn't any growth in the economy, we have gone through a period like that to be able to say what that growth really will look like. I think that you do have a certainly all of our businesses that are focused on America and Asia are going to continue to do well, we don't have a lot of exposure in Russia because of historical activity there and we don't have a lot of exposure in India because the kind of products we have generally are not... adoption rate there is relatively modest. So, if you think about four percent [ph] area for us going to be more in south America, Asia and China and those markets continue to be robust.
Dean Dray - Goldman Sachs: And what specifically is the internal growth assumption for 08?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Don't have a one we are not providing any revenue guidance, we are worried about our cash flow and our EBITDA and we are lot simply worried on debts because everybody is interested. We just make it about cash on cash returns of getting that assets, think down and lets continue to do transaction with our shareholders frankly and that's all we going to do.
Dean Dray - Goldman Sachs: Sure, and then, second question related to the pipeline and NM&A, I recall back in November, you talked about three potential deals coming down to the wire, sounds like CBORD is one of them, about the other two and what does the pipeline run?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well pipelines are still very good, I mean we ... we've been dancing around because of our CBORD being in our view the most attractive thing that you could do and needing to get it done and making sure we ... that we maintain our flexibility. We have winded the worlds depositing CBORD, we are not fully interest seeing any longer then we have a wind up we are continuing to have conversations about that's interesting. But the opportunities and the number of downfalls we've had in ... frankly from the beginning of the year, it is pretty solid and we have opened a dialogue on a lot of different things but will be opportunistic in terms of what we do, we don't have a budget around what we are going to achieve, I think you know, we spent $474 million in the last 12 months and we got a run rate always to able to do $400 million or $500 million over in '08 12 months period and our strategy we need to keep the balance sheet of labor that in a way that is friendly to shareholders that keeps us investing great.
Dean Dray - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Scott Graham with Bear Stearns. Please go ahead.
Scott Graham - Bear Stearns & Co.: Good Morning, Very nice quarter.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Scott Graham - Bear Stearns & Co.: I just wanted to maybe look at the book to bill little bit differently. If you don't mind I understanding off course that you have tough comparison and book to bill is not the perfect way to look at you guys, but when we expect the RF business because its obviously got its own unique dynamics the rise in orders versus the rise in sales this quarter well there is a pretty big discrepancy there, and really the rise almost if you wanted to call that a sort of percentage book to bill was a the rise in orders was only about 60% of the rise in sales and again recognizing that have, have tough order comp on some of the other business. I am just wondering if you not giving in organic growth assumption for 2008, may be shed some light on the book to bill may be from that perspective and why you feel you know comfortable with you know the guidance that you have given because its don't look like Brian that the businesses particularly scientific and industrial with those businesses underlying water trends have, have the pre notably slow then last couple of quarters?
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well I think Scott this John. I think we talked a little bit about what's going on inside scientific and industrial imaging and particularly the impact from the touchscreen and the fact hedge funding is that historically low levels in that US which does effect come on a secondary bases some of the in market demand for some of the higher and camera applications that we have there that it is one those areas inside the imaging where we have not add in control of the end user demand as we are across the other parts of the enterprise. And then as you, as you going to feel the union I mean obviously if you fill the back part you will obviously see some anomaly inside there industrial technology is the other area where because of the occasional projects that will happen inside Neptune, you will also get some anomalies and with in lower private list out every single one of them on the book to bill, chart that we provided, but as we look at it and as we need continued to work with the business, they drive down there cycle times, increase there recovering revenue. We would look this year situation with there book to bill is always at one because they are getting the order on Monday and they are shift in order on Tuesday, and so we are...we are continuing to move towards that direction, but we do have some projects that we will occasionally make that a lumpy apart from different parts of business.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I know, I think you are missing the full year versus one quarter and you are also missing the fact that we have Redlake Motion business we contributed others, which is not adjusted to more in base. So you are getting on a flat basis that you look you don't have apples and apples.
Scott Graham - Bear Stearns & Co.: I agree, I agree with that, absolutely I am still, I think that the discrepancy is more than that however, never less if in fact there is something that occurs in the first half of this year that may be reduces you know the volume that the in take pace of orders, Brain what do you have ready right now in terms of cost reductions that make sure that the guidance staying put?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: You know, its got a, I know you are interested in cost reduction we are interested in motivation and we are interested in land market growth, we are interested in custom service, we are not a traditional manufacturing company, we are not a machinery company. We are not a company that has heavy assets, we are a company that you can see as $30 million of depreciation and $about 30 million of CapEx as it doesn't match the profile been able to business did you cover and you know, I suggest that you want to really come down and have a meaning which John and myself will be glad to do it, but this is a business that's going to be driven by continuous improvement and growth. We don't have a business to run a cut to the bone, because we had a short fall in inventory management from a distribution.
Scott Graham - Bear Stearns & Co.: Fair enough, as I said Brain, at the top congratulation on a good quarter.
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: We will take our next question from Michael Schneider with Robert W. Baird & Co. Please go ahead.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Hey guys, maybe we can just visit one quick time but the freight matching business is 2007 close in 2008 unfolds here, what is the benefit or I guess the hit now of the freight matching business growing within the best versus the tag business. It is clear the trucking industry is slow, as I understand that's actually good for the business. So could you give us an update and kind of how the year end trend finished and then what the benefit here will be of margins and growth in 2008 and that growth?
Brian D. Jellison - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, what happens there it is kind of two folded in a way you are framing it correctly that, if you think about subscribers, if people are staying in the job it use to be that they would be shift out cyclically get into home building and what's happen in an home building drivers will stand more on line, so you don't have maybe as much attrition as you would normally have in terms of subscription fees. We also improved the offering we have which we charged more for certain types of things that people can get from the 360 Program. So, the average subscription is not lower than it was before so that's helpful. We haven't really seen, you know, major fall out, we have been able to sustain and I think because of the coverage we have that kind of equal coverage on the internet for posting loads and reading the data at point...moment we don't have a floor, we are not really seeing if they grow up, we did have some growth in the fourth quarter in Canada so, we are not envisioning that being much of the drag on a weak performance.
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Okay then sticking with margins in that segment as you look back in 07 can you give us a sense what the international project having fully shift at least on the initial installation. Does that mean that the tag mix rose in 2008 again to the benefit of margins?
Michael Schneider - Robert W. Baird: Well, frankly it did better in '07 and we expect it because the customers adopted the tag in a higher rate I believe and perhaps people thought they would in country. So we more follow on tag orders in '07 than we expected, I think the margins in '08 will be at least as good as the margins were in 07, because we will be behind the initial install which has the lowest margin than anything. So, we are feeling pretty good we had good deal or multiple protocol reader adoption and that's going to roll into 2008 we believe so, that will help us as well. So I don't see margin deterioration in the segment I think anything we would see some expansion of margins.
Operator: That will end our question-and-answer session for this call. We now return back to John Humphrey for any closing remarks.
John Humphrey - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. Thank you Cynthia and thank you all for joining us today, and I know a few of you maybe had some follow up questions that we were not able to get to. And we will work on the process to make sure that we allow a few more of those, sorry, about anyone who got cut-off. And I will be available this afternoon to handle any of the follow-up questions you might have. Thanks everyone and we look forward to talking to you in about another nine weeks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen this will conclude Roper Industries fourth quarter year financial results conference call. We thank you for your participation and you may disconnect at this time.
