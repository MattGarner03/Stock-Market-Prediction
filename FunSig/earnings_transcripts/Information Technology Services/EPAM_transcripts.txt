===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-08 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to EPAM Systems First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. And finally, I would like to advise all participants that this call is being recorded. Thank you. I'd now like to welcome Mike Rowshandel, Head of Investor Relations, to begin the conference. Mike, over to you.
Mike Rowshandel: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today, on our first quarter 2025 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Mike Rowshandel, Head of Investor Relations. We hope you've had an opportunity, to review the two news releases we shared earlier today. If you have not, copies are available on epam.com in the Investors Section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investor section of our website. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As you may have seen in our additional press release this quarter, we have one more update to share today that, goes beyond our usual business performance. Alongside our strong Q1 results despite a tough macro environment, we also announced our planned leadership succession. So before we get into the details of our performance and growth momentum, I want to take a moment to share a few thoughts on my planned transition from CEO role. After 32 years since starting in EPAM serving as the Chairman, CEO and President, I decided to transition into the role of Executive Chairman. This move has been thoughtfully planned over the past several years, and I believe that the right moment is now both for me personally, and for the future of the company. But I'm not leaving EPAM as Executive Chairman, I plan to continue providing strategic guidance, combining my years of experience, to hold the relationships and Board leadership, and ensuring that the CEO transition is smooth and effective, and that EPAM continues advancing our mission, culture and values. Beyond the transition period, I will be actively engaged as an employee of the company, and helping to shape EPAM long-term strategic direction, maintaining key relationships with clients, partners and investors, providing guidance on critical strategic initiatives and programs, and promoting the company brand worldwide. I will be closely collaborating with CEO and the leadership team, to help ensure that the values, relationship and strategic focus that have defined EPAM, for decades continue to guide the company future. With that said, I am pleased to announce today that Balazs Fejes, will become our new Chief Executive Officer and President on September 1, 2025. Balazs, better known as FB, joined the company over 20 years ago and has been a critical part of our growth story. His leadership has been instrumental to EPAM development, serving as our first CTO, building our financial services business globally, leading our European and APAC markets, and most recently serving as the President of Global Business and Chief Revenue Officer. FB is uniquely positioned to provide both strategic and operational leadership during our next phase of revolution. I am confident that his rare combination of business and technical acumen, will enable him to continue driving EPAM forward. FB brings not only deep operational experience, but also a strong sense of energy and vision for EPAM's continuous evolution into the world leading AI native transformation company, with a reputation for quality, execution and excellence, commitment to our customers, employees and communities. In terms of timing and priorities, we remain focused on Q2 and full 2025 execution, working hard to extend our sequential momentum by driving and winning more wallet share. The CEO transition plan should be completed on September 1, 2025 at which point we will provide a more comprehensive update, with an opportunity to hear directly from FB. I look forward to working closely with him, our entire executive team and the Board, to support the continuous growth and long-term success of the company, as the EPAM enters the next phase of its evolution. Now let's turn to our Q1 results. I am pleased to share today that our first quarter results came in better than expected, despite a more challenging macroeconomic environment than most would have predicted 90 days ago. This marks our third consecutive quarter of outperformance, and we are pleased to see sequential momentum, which we hope will continue throughout the remainder of this year. In a climate, where cost continues to be top of mind, our clients conversations have been broadly positive, and we are encouraged to see EPAM benefit from supplier consolidation activity in our core portfolio. It continues to be our view that the pivot to reliability, and quality is slowly progressing. EPAM's proven track record and reputation, for high quality execution put us in sweet spot, and is driving increased levels of new deal activity, which is enabling us to maintain and grow our organic footprint with existing clients. Outside the volatility of the broader geopolitical economic environment. Most of the growth themes we have been discussing over the past few quarters, especially AI related, have continued through Q1, and we expect will carry throughout the remainder of this year. During Q1, we returned to double-digit revenue growth year-over-year, and while our inorganic contribution was driving a large portion of that, we are notably delivering year-over-year organic growth as well, which was significantly above our initial Q1 expectations, of being flat at the midpoint of our guidance. This marks our second quarter in a row, of delivering positive year-over-year organic growth since 2022, and illustrates continuous improvement in the core business. Overall in Q1, client sentiment and engagement remain strong across most of our verticals and geographies, with particularly high interest in our rapidly expanding AI related capabilities. Our performance this quarter, was driven by meaningful progress and strengthening client engagement, enhancing cross-selling efforts, and continuing to deliver advanced complex solutions. Our global footprint supported by robust platforms, tools and diversified talent hubs, is enabling us to effectively meet the evolving needs of our clients in rapidly changing business environment. Now turning to demand, despite the notable changes over the past 90 days, we remain cautiously optimistic given our strong Q1 results, and the Q2 momentum we have built. The February and March project ramp up dynamics that, we signaled last quarter played better than expected, with the client sentiment continues to improve. Further, we are encouraged by the incremental demand we continue to see for our AI capabilities, as focus on productivity and efficiency gains turns into more comprehensive AI native transformation programs, and encompass multiple types of AI centered solutions. In short, our baseline client demand in H1, is improving faster than anticipated. While we remain mindful of external pressures, caused by challenges in our clients and markets, as well as isolated instances of increased caution, and shift in decision making due to microeconomic uncertainty, we have not seen any material impact on our business to-date. Overall, we feel good about the resilience of our performance, so far this year. It's also important to emphasize that we are doing everything we can to stay closely our aligned with our clients, taking proactive, disciplined steps to effectively manage our operations, ensuring we are well prepared to respond to any potential impacts, as we head into the second half of 2025. In addition, reflecting our recent client conversations, one thing become clear during the past few years of greater volatility. Some clients who had prioritize cost above all else in selecting partners are now returning to EPAM. Their experience with underperforming programs has reinforced the critical value of deep expertise, consistent delivery quality and the trusted ability to execute at scale. That is why even as we expect 2025, to remain a year of transition, with the potential for increase uncertainty in the second half. We believe clients will continue to focus on the most strategic priorities, which should translate into stronger growth for us, compared to 2024. And our credibility and growing reputation as a leading partner in AI and AI native transformation, already driving greater market awareness and demand, a trend we expect to continue throughout the remainder of this year. Now moving into our four global delivery hubs, which now working together in some new ways, and with rapidly growing access to our advanced AI enabled productivity platforms. In Q1, we saw another quarter of sequential increase in net organic headcount across India, Europe and Western Central Asia. Central Eastern Europe continues to be a cornerstone geography for us, and serves as a backbone for many long-term clients with growing global location strategies. We saw modest growth in Hungary, Poland, Croatia and Serbia, and stability across the rest of the region. Ukraine as well remains stable in terms of scale, and core capabilities as our nearly 9,000 people remain highly productive, and continue to support both new and current clients, across a diverse range of programs. In India, we continue to see strong demand for differentiated product engineering offerings alongside our core capabilities in platforms, cloud, data and AI. The momentum we built last quarter carried out into Q1, with additional net head current growth, we are also deepening our relationships with Global Capability Centers or GCCs, reinforcing our role as a trusted transformation partner. In Western and Central Asia, we continue to invest and expand our delivery presence, with modest net additions across several locations. As we shared in the past, these locations allow us to have even greater adaptability, when it comes to serving our clients by balancing cost, quality and execution and in some cases proximity to client locations. Finally, in Latin America we continue to progress with our significantly expanding client, and talent footprint with the addition of NEORIS. Now shifting to AI. As highlighted in our recently published AI report, while improved productivity and operational efficiency remain universal goals, scaling AI adoption across the enterprise continues to be a challenge. In fact, only 30% of even the most advanced companies surveyed, reported success in implementing AI at scale. Given that AI at scale remains a relatively new concept today, we believe the broader transformation required including modernizing platforms, data, organizational structures, skills and business processes. All of that represents a significant opportunity for EPAM. Our unique combination of deep engineering, and consulting expertise backed by our advanced suite of IP tools and accelerators, position us well to lead in this space. While the AI landscape is evolving rapidly, one thing is undeniable. AI continues to drive new demand for us, even in the context of traditional modernization programs. AI plays a central role in majority of client discussions. We are currently engaged in a wide range of AI initiatives, with the vast majority of our top 100 clients. Our early stage AI engagements are maturing visibly with strong year-over-year growth with more of them evolving into mid-sized projects, with clearly defined outcomes and measurable ROIs. As we expand into larger scale AI factories, these programs are becoming increasingly comprehensive. Now incorporating Agentic AI in government frameworks, while also scaling in volume and complexity. In Q1, our AI native revenues grew strong double-digit quarter-over-quarter continues the strong momentum from the previous quarter. As we continue to mature our AI consulting and engineering offerings. We are also strengthening our overall value proposition, by partnering with strategic players in cloud, data and platforms, to deliver innovative commercially attractive software assets, focused on industry specific transformation and productivity gains. One illustrative example of our progress, is an oil and gas manufacturing vertical, where we develop breakthrough innovation in AI-powered geospatial data visualization and insights. Built in partnership with Google Cloud Industry Solutions, this work led to EPAM being named Google 2025 Partner of the Year for Oil and Gas. The solution, which integrates with Google Gemini models, can also apply to broader data challenges across manufacturing and supply chain use cases demonstrating our deep domain expertise, our ability to handle large and complex data sets in our proven track record in delivering a native cloud based applications at scale. Another strong example is our ongoing effort to advance global engineering productivity through AI. Our focus extends beyond individual code generation to full lifecycle transformation in team environments. In Q3 of last year we introduced EPAM AI/Run, our AI native SDLC framework and toolkit and we are now well-positioned to build on this foundation through a strategic collaboration agreement with AWS. By leveraging advanced generative AI services including Amazon Bedrock, we will empower clients to develop specialized AI agent in a native solution that addresses, SDLC productivity challenges for large teams. This collaboration creates a robust platform for accelerating cloud and data modernization through AI driven workflow and tooling automation. Finally, to illustrate our continuous innovation with the EPAM DIAL platform, we continue to integrate advanced AI technologies into custom tailored business strategies which is driving significant impact across the industry and open source community. DIAL has evolved through several advancements and iterations since we started building it. Today, DIAL is a complete GenAI platform with orchestration including Agentic marketplace, Mind Maps and DIAL Expressive Logic and so much more. DIAL is evolving into a complete AI platform for enterprises. To conclude, we are pleased with our stronger than expected Q1 results, the improvement in organic growth and the sequential momentum we continue to build. Our increasingly diversified and agile global delivery hubs combined with advanced AI native capabilities and deepening strategic partnerships are having real impact. As we shared it last quarter, we expected 2025 to be a transformative year and that outlook is proving true, perhaps even more visibly than we anticipated three months ago. We are encouraged by the opportunities ahead and remain cautiously optimistic about the second half of 2025 even as macro uncertainty persists, our focus and disciplined execution remains our top priority. Let me now turn call over to Jason who will provide additional details on our Q1 results in 2025 outlook.
Jason Peterson: Thank you Ark and good morning everyone. In the first quarter, EPAM generated revenue of $1.3 billion, a year-over-year increase of 11.7% on a reported basis. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue grew 1.4% compared to the first quarter of 2024, exceeding our expectations of flat organic growth anticipated at the midpoint of our Q1 guidance. We are pleased to deliver another quarter of year-over-year organic growth in constant currency, reflecting ongoing demand for EPAM services and strong execution across our global portfolio of clients. As Ark mentioned, we believe the outperformance is in part driven by client recognition of EPAM's superior delivery quality and momentum across our AI offerings. Moving to our Q1 vertical performance, four out of six industry verticals delivered strong to very strong revenue growth. Revenues from our FD and NEORIS acquisitions had the most impact on our financial services and emerging verticals, so I will break out the organic and inorganic contribution within these two verticals. Financial services delivered very strong growth of 29.3% year-over-year, reflecting 4.5% organic growth in constant currency driven by continued strength in insurance, banking and payments. Software and Hi-Tech grew 9.6% year-over-year, driven by strong execution and broad improvement across our existing portfolio as well as new logo activity. Life sciences and healthcare increased 10.5% on a year-over-year basis. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by clients in life sciences and med-tech. Generic goods, retail and travel decreased 1.4% year-over-year, largely due to declines in consumer products and retail, partially offset by growth in travel, business, information and media, declined 2.2% year-over-year. Our emerging verticals delivered very strong growth of 22.8%. Growth was positively impacted by NEORIS industrial materials customers. Emerging verticals organic revenue in constant currency contracted by 3.5% and was negatively impacted by softness across manufacturing and telecom clients. From a geographic perspective, America is our largest region, representing 60% of our Q1 revenues, grew 12.6% year-over-year. EMEA, representing 38% of our Q1 revenues, increased 10.7% year-over-year. And finally, APAC, representing 2% of our revenues, increased 4.3% year-over-year. Each of our geographies delivered year over year organic constant currency revenue growth in the quarter. Lastly, in Q1, revenues from our top 20 clients grew 6.1% year-over-year, while revenues from clients outside our Top 20 increased 14.6%. Moving down the income statement, our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 26.9% compared to 28.4% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 28.7% compared to 30.4% for the same quarter last year. Relative to Q1 2024, gross margin in Q1 2025 was negatively impacted by 2024 compensation increases which were only partially offset through pricing. Additionally, lower profitability from recent acquisitions negatively impacted gross margin. The negative impacts from compensation and lower profitability from acquisitions exceeded the benefits of improved utilization and the positive impact from the Polish R&D incentive. The company will be focused on improving gross margin throughout the remainder of the year. GAAP SG&A was 16.8% of revenue compared to 17% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A in Q1 2025 came in at 14.2% of revenue compared to 14.1% in the same period last year. GAAP income from operations was $99 million or 7.6% of revenue in the quarter compared to $111 million or 9.5% of revenues in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $176 million or 13.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to $174 million, or 14.9% of revenue in Q1 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 22.2% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.1%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.28. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.41 compared to $2.46 in Q1 of last year, reflecting a $0.05 decrease year-over-year. In Q1 there were approximately $57.3 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operations for Q1 was $24 million compared to $130 million in the same quarter. 2024. Higher bonus payments in Q1 2025 and a higher DSO resulting from the impact of an increasing share of fixed fee revenues with associated milestone billing both contributed to the year-over-year decline in operating cash flows. Free cash flow was $15 million compared to free cash flow of $123 million in the same quarter last year. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.2 billion as with the end of the quarter. At the end of Q1, DSO was 75 days and compares to 70 days for Q4 2024 and 73 days for the same quarter last year. Share repurchases in the first quarter were approximately 796,000 shares for $160 million at an average price of $201.07 per share. Moving on to a few operational metrics, we ended the Q1 with more than 55,600 consultants, designers, engineers and architects, reflecting total growth of 18.2% and organic growth of 6.4% compared to Q1 2024. In the quarter, we added over 500 professionals. Our total headcount for the quarter was more than 61,700 employees. Utilization was 77.5% compared to 76.8% in Q1 of last year and 76.2% in Q4 2024. Now let's turn to Guidance. Before moving to the specifics of our 2025 and Q2 outlook, I'd like to provide some thoughts to help frame our guidance. While the macroeconomic environment remains highly dynamic, we are pleased with our strong Q1 performance with year-over-year organic constant currency revenue growth exceeding our expectations. This has resulted in three consecutive quarters of sequential organic revenue growth. With good visibility into Q2, we expect ongoing improvement in our organic revenues with both year over year and sequential growth in the quarter. We continue to experience improving demand for our highly differentiated services and client budgets appear to remain substantially intact. With a few pockets of caution which we are closely monitoring. Clients are turning to EPAM for trusted quality of execution and our advanced AI offerings. To date, we have not seen a material slowdown in client spending as evidenced by our stronger than expected Q1 performance and sequential momentum we have seen thus far in Q2. That said, we acknowledge the elevated uncertainty in macroeconomic risks considering our stronger than expected first half balanced with a thoughtful assessment of client demand in our second half, we are raising the lower end of our organic full year revenue guidance, while leaving the upper end of the range unchanged. There are several additional factors impacting our view of revenue growth during the remainder of the year. Since we issued guidance last quarter, certain currencies have strengthened considerably relative to the U.S. dollar. At the same time, due to the elevated uncertainties resulting from tariffs and impacts on the manufacturing and materials industries, we are seeing a reduction in demand from a top customer acquired as part of our NEORIS acquisition. With our improved organic revenue contribution the expected benefit from foreign exchange partially offset by a modest reduction in expected inorganic revenues, we are raising both the upper and lower end of our reported revenue guidance. Our guidance continues to assume that we will be able to deliver out of our Ukraine delivery centers at productivity levels similar to those achieved in 2024. So, moving on to the full year outlook, revenue growth will now be in the range of 11.5% to 14.5% with an inorganic contribution of approximately 9% for 2025. Based on today's spot exchange rates coupled with an assumption of modest strengthening in the U.S. dollar in the second half, foreign exchange is now expected to have a positive impact on revenue growth of 0.4%. We expect year-over-year revenue growth on an organic constant currency basis to now be in the range of 2% to 5%. We expect GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 9% to 10% and non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to now be 25%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate will, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation will continue to be 24%. For earnings per share, we expect that GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $6.78 to $7.03 for the full year and non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $10.70 to $10.95 for the full year. The increase in non GAAP diluted EPS is in part driven by our assumption of a reduced share count resulting from our plan to increase share repurchases within the constraints of the current share repurchase authorization. We now expect weighted average share count 56.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Moving to our Q2 2025 outlook, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.325 to $1.340 billion producing year-over-year growth of 16.2% at the midpoint of the range. Our guidance reflects an inorganic contribution of 10.6% with a 1.8% positive foreign exchange impact during the quarter. For the second quarter we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 9% to 10% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 14% to 15%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 26% and our non GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.67 to $1.75 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted the EPS to be in the range of $2.56 to $2.64 for the quarter. With increases in share repurchases during the year, we expect a weighted average share count of 56.7 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non GAAP measurements for Q2 and the full year. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $40 million for Q2, $45 million for Q3 and $46 million for Q4. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $17 million for each of the remaining quarters. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be negligible for each of the remaining quarters. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $13 million for Q2 and $15 million for Q3 and $14 million for Q4. We expect excess tax shortfall to be around $1 million for Q2 with minimal excess tax benefits or shortfalls in the remaining quarters. Severance driven by our cost optimization programs is expected to be around $2 million in Q2 and $3 million for each of the remaining quarters. Finally, one more assumption outside of our GAAP to non-GAAP items, with the increased share repurchases we will have a lower level of interest generating cash. Therefore, we now expect interest and other income to be $2 million in both Q2 and Q3 and $3 million in Q4. We remain committed to continuing to drive sequential momentum and are confident in our positioning entering Q2. Despite the dynamic environment, we will continue to run EPAM efficiently while remaining focused on strong execution and profitability throughout the year. Lastly, my continued thanks to all our employees for their dedication and focus on serving our clients and driving results for EPAM. Operator, let's open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Bryan Bergin: Hi good morning. Thank you. Ark, first just congrats on all the success with you built here and congrats to FB for his promotion. My first question is the '25 growth guide. You raise your organic view here on the low end by point looks to be good 1Q and 2Q view. Can you give more color on that second half confidence? What are you seeing in underlying macro, and how did you think about what you have contracted versus what you need to still go get?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we still continue our kind of look forward views in line with what we were doing for the last couple of quarters. So our view for the year didn't change much, but we definitely saw the first half of the year better than we expected. So our again projection for the second part practically in line with what we communicated during the last quarter. And as soon as we will see better visibility later on, we will kind of address this. But right now it's, what we've seen and basically we didn't see any specifics, which is changing this view. Again, outside of normal.
Jason Peterson: Yes. To go back to the last earnings call, we talked about the fact that we'd seen a soft January, and then we expect to see improvement in February and March. We absolutely saw that. We're still seeing improvement in demand in April and May. It's difficult obviously to forecast during the remainder of the year, but we are looking into Q3, still feeling like the book of business looks quite solid. And then the guide would reflect the fact that, things could be soft in Q4. But again, we're not seeing any change in client purchasing behavior at this time. And generally what we are seeing is some amount of, return to EPAM for quality of execution, which we think has probably been helpful for us, and maybe explains the difference in our results relative to some of our peers.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. Makes sense. And then follow-up, it's just kind of around the bookings dynamics. Any detail you can just give us around bookings to help convey the magnitude of the positive directionality that's forming here. And you're attributing better performance and optimism, partly from a pickup in AI related work. Just any numbers you can put around these?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. I think the only, you know, specific that we would have is on the AI native portfolio that we talked about last quarter. As we look from Q1 to Q2, we would say that we probably have double-digit, let's say, strong double-digit sort of growth in AI related revenues between Q1 and Q2. So again, nice improvement in those revenues.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thank you very much for taking my question. Congratulations for me as well to both Ark and FB. I wanted to ask about free cash flow, and I know you called out some of the drivers of the lower free cash flow result this quarter on a year-over-year basis, how should we expect that to trend, as we move through the year? Are some of these drivers more persistent, or do you expect things to normalize soon?
Jason Peterson: Yes, I think the, you always have seasonality with us, right. So Q1, is usually low. Q1 was a lot better last year. And again some of it has to do with all the payments we have associated, with bonuses and things that happen in Q1. I would, I still would say that, we expect kind of 80% to 90% kind of cash flow conversion, which is consistent. The only thing that I would say is maybe a little bit of a change, is I do think DSO is probably going to stay a little bit elevated. I think in the past we would have talked maybe around 73 or so. I think it is likely to stay a few days higher. And as we see more fixed fee revenues, we do see some milestone billings and some of that stuff, which usually means the invoices go out a little bit later. And we are seeing a little bit of an impact on DSO related to that.
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. A follow-up from me is on, on the pricing environment, and as you're seeing organic demand know pick up. Are you starting to sense now that you might be able to, you know, deploy a little bit of pricing later in the year, or is that it's still too early to call?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it's too early to call, and we indicated last time that I think it is going to be and it is a gap between this. It would be some lagging changes. So it's not going to happen too quickly. That's what we show and I think I would like to put in perspective also. Yes, we see improvements, but this improvement still relatively small. So it should be, it should be bigger change, and should start it impact great situation.
Ramsey El-Assal: Thank you very much.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Maggie Nolan: Hi. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit more in specifics about plans, to improve gross margin over the remainder of the year particularly in light of, mentioning that the guidance allows for some softening in the fourth quarter?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So the, I think there's always some benefit that results in the second half just due to kind of seasonal factors, and pushing past, social security sort of spend, caps and some of that type of stuff. And so to be fair, usually you would have a stronger Q3, because of more bill days and some other factors. And at the same time, we are focused on improving utilization. And so, we continue to sort of focus on taking some amount of actions and obviously working to drive revenue growth, but with a commitment to kind of getting utilization back to sort of 77%, and then over time, probably in 2026, kind of better. And so, we've just got kind of a renewed focus on improving utilization.
Maggie Nolan: Okay. Thank you. And can you size partnership revenue within the business, or give an idea of how it's trended in the last couple of years, and is this an important growth driver for the business going forward?
Jason Peterson: I can answer the last question, which would be yes. Unfortunately, I don't think I can give you a specific kind of impact, but yes, it's been obviously, very helpful, both the co-funding and the introductions to clients. And it is definitely part of what has driven revenue growth over time. And our commitment to the partnerships and certainly and investment in the partnerships has certainly been helpful.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Please go ahead.
David Grossman: Good morning. Thank you. I wonder if you just speak a little bit more about the growth dynamics within the customer cohorts. I think the growth outside the top 20, is obviously reaccelerated, and maybe in the context of that question, maybe speak a little bit about, when the customer losses comp out, and if it remains a headwind in the second quarter. I think you said in your prepared remarks that, certain customers are coming back to you, and maybe if you could just flush out that dynamic a little bit more?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think there is. That's what we were mentioning for some time, and each quarter we see a little bit more and a little bit more this. Clearly it's not compensated and it's not like all coming back, but the trend is very visible. And I think partially why we see this improvements, and because this trend is repeating and kind of accumulating quarter-after-quarter.
David Grossman: And maybe explain that dynamic Ark outside the Top 20, why that growth rate is, kind of accelerating versus the Top 20?
Jason Peterson: Yes, I think sometimes when you have M&A and particularly larger scale M&A like we have, there are a larger number of sort of small customers introduced. And I think it's a little hard to do an apples-to-apples comparison just, because of the magnitude of the M&A introduced in Q4. And so, I think some of what you're seeing is probably M&A driven. But we are seeing improvements in kind of, new logos and the introduction of kind of new customers that are clearly kind of helping relationships. One of the things, we've talked about a little bit is growth in the Middle East where we see a number of new engagements. So yes, that's probably what I would say at this point.
David Grossman: Got it. And then just on the supply side, maybe you could speak just a little bit about where you think India is today versus your most mature geographies in terms of the whole dynamic around recruiting, the relationships, your ability to kind of fill kind of demand for resources at the price points that you want. Just -- I don't know if there's a way to really characterize that, but just somehow compare because you've been in India since, what, 2015, 2016. I know there was a lot of work done there to modify that model. But just curious, where we are in India today versus your most mature recruiting kind of infrastructure in the Ukraine?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think David, it will be difficult comparison because it's not like in -- because very different dynamic. Like if you ask me like 20 years ago where our today considered mature locations, it would be probably from dynamics point of view very similar, because the ratio of senior people versus junior was very different. India right now is growing fast and there is a very strong level of maturity in the top of the pyramid which is comparable with anything else. But the number of more junior people and accommodated to our requirements still bigger versus like mature like Ukraine or something which is not growing for the last couple years. But I think this general gap is shrinking and quality is growing and there are perceptions from race and everything else which build up not by us over the last couple decades. So I think we work into manage all of this. But again India is extremely important part that's practically 20% of our capacity right now and we'll be growing and it's growing right now fast.
David Grossman: Right. All right, great. Thanks for that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Lee with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Lee: Great. Thanks for taking our questions and let me echo my congrats to Ark and FB on their respective positions. Look, you highlighted strength stemming from the GCCs. Can you talk through how much of the growth you're expecting in this year is driven by GCC related work? How does that impact any of your contract structures, duration or contract profitability?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I don't think we can share specific numbers here. We just not doing this. And the contract there fortunately very much in line with other contracts in our industry. So while it could be any type of lacks, still there is no guarantee the substance will be here tomorrow because usually there are pretty simple cancellations, terminations kind of terms there. So -- and profitability mostly in line with what we see in India across other clients.
Jason Peterson: Yes, so it's part of the growth. But I wouldn't say it's the big part of the growth story. And then the other thing I just say is that they continue to sort of value EPAM's differentiated engineering capabilities. So that continues to be a selling point for us with the GCCs.
Jonathan Lee: Understood. And look, it's good to hear the traction that you're seeing around the native AI volumes. How are you thinking about the level of reinvestment needed to continue to drive that AI related volume, particularly as it relates to the 90 basis point headwind you called out on margins last quarter?
Jason Peterson: Yes, I think that, that the investment that we're making, probably no change in terms of what we said during the last earnings call. So we are making investment. We do think it's producing real benefit. Again, we are getting really positive feedback from clients around again, our differentiation. And I think that, what you see is maybe some reduction in the spend as percentage of revenue once you get more into 2026. But right now I would say, it's generally similar to what we talked about at the beginning of the year and in the last earnings call.
Jonathan Lee: Appreciate that color.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Jason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. Appreciate it and congrats on the management transition. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the vendor consolidation point. I think that came up a couple of times. It sounds like there's certain instances where clients are coming back to the EPAM. Can you just talk about some of the specific project types where you're seeing that happen and which delivery centers are seeing that work get processed in? When you have these situations where work is coming back to EPAM from competitors, I'm curious where the clients are having that work get done? Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. It is pretty broad because even when it's coming back, it's not necessary the work coming back exactly to the location where it was delivered before. Because during the last several years, as we said, there are -- there were a lot of changes and kind of this restructuring of our delivery centers. So what work coming back to Eastern Europe, work coming back with a switch to India. So we're coming back to Western Central Asia. So it's a pretty, pretty broad. Okay. But some specifically, if possible, if sometimes possible, coming back exactly the locations where it was started from. But again it's pretty, pretty diverse.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay, understood. And the second thing I wanted to ask was just in the Q1 revenue, just from a quarter-over-quarter perspective, financial services really stood out. You were up 12% there, I'm assuming since it was quarter-over-quarter, it was all organic. And I'm just wondering if there were a couple of sizable contract ramps there or any additional color on that vertical, what you saw there and sustainability of that into Q2 and beyond?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So in the Q4 to Q1 compare, you would have had two months of NEORIS and two months of FD in Q4 and three months of NEORIS and three months of FD in Q1. Both of those acquisitions have got a significant financial services component. So some of it is that, and at the same time we are seeing improvement in the organic business and we do expect to continue to see improvement in the organic business and financial services. Banking, some amount of growth in insurance and we've also seen some growth in payers, at least in Q1. But probably banking would be maybe the biggest area of improvement.
Jason Kupferberg: Thanks, Jason.
Jason Peterson: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Jamie Friedman: Hi, good morning. And let me echo my congratulations to Ark. I learned a lot from you over the years and to FB on your future endeavors. So I'll just ask my two up front. The fixed price Jason, that you call it out, that did grow 19.4% up from 15.1%. I'm just be interested in your perspective both on your confidence on the delivery side because when you move in a fixed price, the risk does get reassigned. So that's the first one. And then on the second one just go back to Jon's question earlier. The dip in the gross margins to 26.9%, Jason, is that the wage increment or, or is that still to come? Thank you both.
Jason Peterson: Yes. Okay, so let me do the last question first. Okay. On the gross margin, when you look at the Q1 to Q1 compare, we would have a salary increase that would occur in Q2 of 2024 and we would probably also have some market adjustments in Q3 and Q4. And so when you do a Q1 to Q1 compare, you don't have the salary increase in the Q1 of 2024. But it does show up in the Q1 2025. And then what we've been talking about is just there isn't as much ability to pass on the salary increases with rate increases to clients, although we're seeing a little bit of improvement in the case of. And then the other thing as we talked about is that the margin reduction that comes from the two acquisitions which has about 50 basis point negative impact. So I guess that's first question or the second question. The first question was?
Jamie Friedman: Yes, fixed price.
Jason Peterson: Yes, fixed price. Again, a little bit complicated. Some of it is evolution of our pricing models and it's not always, we're going to do something for tens of millions of dollars for two years. Sometimes it's just a monthly fixed fee arrangement for either a team. It may assume some productivity, but again there isn't as much kind of risk associated with that. And then also with NEORIS and FD, they've got more fixed fee in their engagements, although usually shorter term. And so that's what kind of caused the shift as you look into Q1. But I think you'll continue to see a little bit of evolution. It may be also part of the model with the use of AI, which is to introduce some productivity, but do it with a fixed monthly fee type component and be able to produce some benefit for the client but also some better margin for us.
Jamie Friedman: Got it. Thank you. I'll drop back in the queue.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Puneet Jain. Please go ahead.
Puneet Jain: Hi, thanks for taking my question and please accept my congratulations as well. It's been great working with you over last so many years. I wanted to ask Jason about the guidance and the billing based dynamics that are baked in second half for this year. Can you remind us like I know in the past I think you talked about that you expect higher billing days in the second half. Can you remind us like what does this guidance assume from first half to second half and the visibility you have on second half ramp?
Jason Peterson: Yes, so we never assumed improvement in billing throughout the year. What we did say is that we did expect that as the demand environment improve that there would be the ability to pass on, more rate increases next year. So right now, I would say that, no real change in the environment. You still have some cost takeout exercises going on with clients. There's some modest opportunity for rate increases. And so again, it may be not as bad. The pricing isn't let's say as challenging as it was last year, but still not significantly improved. And then as I just kind of look ahead, again, we do have quite good visibility in Q2, and all indications are that that would carry through into Q3. But of course, as we know, things are subject to change. As Ark said in his prepared remarks. We're not seeing, almost any sort of changes in demands from clients or slowdown in project spend. And so that's kind of how we're thinking about Q3. Clearly we got some benefit from foreign exchange, and we tried to be clear on that, that particularly the appreciation of the euro, should take up anybody's revenue guide. And I'm happy to share specifically the assumptions that we used in the production of the guide.
Puneet Jain: Yes, that's great. But I'm sorry, I meant to ask like billing days, number of like the days like people can work excluding holidays and vacation in the quarter?
Jason Peterson: Yes, so Q3 is always more bill days, and so it would have a natural. You should get growth in Q2 to Q3 just based on seasonality. Q2 has got less bill days than Q3, but it's got, it still has got relatively good bill days. And so it, you know, if you just looked at seasonal patterns, you would expect an improvement for Q2 to Q3, and then arguably a decline Q3 to Q4. The last couple years, we haven't seen that. We've seen growth between Q3 and Q4, even in challenging demand environments. But right now, particularly the midpoint of the guide would have the more kind of the seasonal feel to it, again with a little bit of improvement in revenue, between Q2 and Q3 driven by seasonality. And some softness in Q4, which could be demand related, but also is just generally, what can be a seasonal pattern.
Puneet Jain: Okay. Thank you.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Darrin Peller: Guys, thanks. And Ark congrats on everything. Guys, your headcount showed notable year-over-year growth even after accounting for the employees added from the two recent acquisitions. So maybe just a little bit more color on your overall headcount strategy for this year, where you're really sourcing talent from on a relative basis, versus - let's just say a couple of years back, and really what roles you're hiring for would be helpful for now?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think we, in general clearly much more careful with, even with this result and with better than we expected first half of the year. We're - very cautious and careful about what would be happening. So and we trying to maintain better bench from this point of view. And when we bring in people, we bring in people in locations where we expect in this type of environment more demand, until again to confirm that situation really changes. Because again I would like to still keep a balance between the positive results of H1, and reality of H2 is very difficult to predict. So basically India still is a fastest growing, and we bringing people from the market with a very specific skills and juniors as well, because we believe that we can train better with all advances of AI impacting the SDLC process. The same balance happening in other locations. But again as you see from the numbers, the number of new employees in other locations is relatively small right now.
Darrin Peller: Okay.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Enhancing our training capabilities, because we would like to be ready if necessary to increase recruitment. But right now we're very, very careful on this.
Darrin Peller: That makes sense. Ark, where are we in terms of size of average engagement on AI deals now? And just maybe a little more color on how that's trended and where you see that going. Just kind of curious for any kind of - quantitative update to the best you can provide on AI?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think here we can repeat what we were saying during the last quarter, and this is happening and this trend continues. The size is increasing and going to more production type of situation, with more number of use cases and functionality. So size of the yields definitely increases. Another thing that the type of what we verify is AI, what type of applications is dynamically changing as well. That's why sometimes it's very difficult to have real apple-to-apple comparison with what we're doing and can do this internally, because is much easier to do than - external announcement and some competition. The size of the deals definitely increases - number of the deals increasing. When we were talking about few deals like 10 mill plus then this number is bigger as well.
Mike Rowshandel: Operator, we have time for one more question please. And your final question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jim Schneider: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and Ark congrats on well-deserved transition. Two if I may. One is, your commentary on client conversations, and outlook appears significantly better at least from my perception relative to some of your peers. So you mentioned the - some clients returning, but can you attribute that to any other sort of specific kinds of project work, or other client specific factors that you're seeing in terms of the better client outlook. And then maybe in terms of your visibility into the second half, any way of sort of quantifying your second half backlog coverage perhaps being better, worse or the same as in a typical time after Q1? Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think, you would expect and I think this is exactly what's happening that, when clients coming back to us, he is a boss sometimes we get in exactly the same work, which we were kind of doing before. Sometimes it's a very new engagement. So that spread around this things. If we're talking about second half of the year I only can. We only can repeat what we said already. So with all kind of better environment visibility still relatively difficult, and what we seen for the second part of the year is approximately what we were seeing a quarter ago. So decisions still making more in real-time. That's what we benefited in Q1 and Q2 so predicting Q3, Q4 better than we predicted so far is difficult including the size of the deals as well. So I think we can share more next quarter.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Again, thank you. Thank you very much. I think hopefully it was a little bit better message from us than before. So at the same time, with all this encouragement about opportunities ahead of us. We thinking about the future is cautious optimism based on everything what's happening, and everything which is relatively uncertain from macro environment. I would like to make sure that we balancing, the good message with a difficult very difficult environment. Thank you and still talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much.
Operator: That concludes our conference call for today. Thank you for participating. You may now all disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-20 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 EPAM Systems Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Finally, I would like to advise all participants that this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to welcome Mike Rowshandel, Head of Investor Relations, to begin the conference. Mike, over to you.
Mike Rowshandel: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Mike Rowshandel, Head of Investor Relations. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2024 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investor Relations section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. It's good to share that our first quarter results came in better than expected. It was another quarter of strong execution, thanks to our core differentiation and relevance of our advanced capabilities and service offerings across our new and existing client portfolios. Many of the encouraging themes we shared last quarter have carried through into this quarter. Before discussing our Q4 results and some thoughts on 2025, I would like to step back and reflect on the full year 2024, which was a year of uneven demand, improved stabilization and building some sequential momentum. There are three key points I would like to highlight on our performance over the past year. Number one, we were successfully executing our global business strategy while simultaneously addressing many challenges we have accumulated during the last few years. We have done this both organically and through acquisitions with a continuous focus on becoming the most globally geo-balanced talent company in the world for AI native digital business services. The two most recent acquisitions, NEORIS and First Derivative or FD are good examples of how we are investing to accelerate our strategy. They allowed us to meaningfully expand our existing global client relationship and further penetrate new markets and talent geo hubs. While still early, we see encouraging progress across several net new opportunities with more than dozen joint pursuit that combine EPAM NEORIS and FD capabilities together. Number two, we are pleased to end the year with an underlying improvement on our standalone business, delivering better results than our expectations earlier in the year when we had to adjust our outlook for a weaker than expected H1. And finally, number three, exiting 2024, we feel good about the sequential momentum we've built over the past two quarters and see encouraging signs as we look ahead into 2025. While there is still plenty of caution in growth market sensitivity, we believe we see some fundamental improvements in the business. This gives us optimism that 2025 will be a much more transformative and better year for us than 2024 was. Now turning to our Q4 results. During Q4, we grew mid-single-digits, both year-over-year and sequentially, notably returning to organic revenue growth for the first time since Q1 of 2023. We continue to see improvements in client sentiments and engagements across all our verticals and geographies and particularly around our AI-related capabilities. Our performance in Q4 was driven by our ability to increase our clients' trust and reassure continuous superior quality execution in our key horizontal and vertical domains, while simultaneously offering more globally diversified talent. On a standalone basis, excluding recent acquisitions, we saw four out of six verticals grow year-over-year with five out of six growing sequentially, reflecting strong momentum from last quarter. Key verticals to call out include life science and healthcare, software and high tech, financial services and emerging. Across geographies, we see a similar story to last quarter with Americas and APAC leading growth year-over-year with Europe continued to show organic sequential revenue growth. Now turning to demand, we are encouraged to see a modestly more positive demand environment compared to 90 days ago. Sentiment continues to improve across our existing and newly acquired clients' portfolios. These clients rely on us for our core engineering DNA as well as our advanced generic capabilities. In some cases we are consolidating work from other suppliers as clients shift toward a more engineering-led and scale programs. In our most recent conversations across the C-suite, the underlying tone and buying signals are higher than they were last year with further accumulation of technical and data depth. Over the past 12 months, we are seeing accelerated take up in more scaled and transformational AI programs. Based on the significant backlog of technical and data modernization along with new AI related demand, we believe that 2025 will be the year where we begin to see real generic first mover advantages. While we're relatively optimistic about the midterm outlook with more encouraging client buying signals than 12 months back, we do still see multiple packets of caution driven by broad macro risks, policy specific uncertainty due to a very dynamic geopolitical environment and certain challenges in some of our clients and talent markets. Further cost very much remains in focus and continues to be an important decision factor for many of our clients. So based on these uncertainties in our current vantage point, we are balancing our optimism as clients continue to transition and modestly expand their discretionary spend. Moving into our global delivery approach, we demonstrated strong execution throughout the year as we continue to diversify our global talent pools and bring in more optionality to our clients across all four of our major delivery hubs in Europe, India, Latin America and Western Central Asia. In Q4 we saw sequential improvements of net organic additions which was broader than just India and included some of our traditional European locations. Europe remains core to us as a top talent pool and we believe we will continue to grow in the region as discretionary spend returns to higher levels. Ukraine is an interesting example to share given the geopolitical environment. While production headcount remains mostly in line year-over-year, in Q4 we saw sequential net additions for the first time since the start of the Russian invasion. We believe this is a positive signal of our clients' comfort level and desire to return to some of our traditional locations. In India, we hit an important milestone for the company as it now represents our largest single country delivery location and second as a region. In just 10 years, EPAM has achieved 10x growth in India with now over 10,000 employees. This speaks to our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and our commitment to invest in a globally diverse and talent workforce in line with EPAM core DNA. In Latin America, we significantly strengthened our footprint with new areas making Latin America our third largest delivery region and a very important pillar in our global model. We believe we have now the right mix of talent focusing on delivery for North American clients coupled with a deep local expertise and strong capabilities to engage and deliver in LatAm. In Western Central Asia, as we mentioned last quarter, we continue to progress quite nicely with our still relatively new delivery hub of over 7,300 people now. Back to the two acquisitions we closed in Q4. In overall, with NEORIS and FD, we significantly increased our global footprint with the addition of nearly 6,000 people combined, primarily across Latin America, Canada, Spain, UK and Ireland. We remain committed to executing our global delivery strategy further. Now shifting to GenAI, even with all the recent noise, sometimes the significant level of confusion and debates. We are seeing indicators of positive change and growing impact. Overall, we continue to make significant traction across our client portfolio with now 75% of our top country clients engaged on GenAI initiatives. Our early-stage projects continue to show strong growth year-over-year with 1,000s of new verticals, use cases emerging and turning into Agentic AI pilots. These are now midsized AI projects with more defined outcomes. We are beginning to see more volume and we believe this speaks to the investment and traction clients are making in this space. These programs have the high probability of turning into agentic transformation, plays in key horizontal and vertical domains. Finally, in our larger-scale AI factories, we manage the entire AI portfolio of agents and applications throughout the program lifecycle and generate tens of millions of dollars in value by each such engagements. Our GenAI and AI-driven client engagement could also be presented in three major dimensions. Dimension one, SDLC and other-related areas of individual and team productivity improvements. Dimension two, data and cloud engagements, triggered by the need to enable AI native program at scale. Dimension three, scaled AI native programs and platforms with the goal to drive value against proven business cases and when clients already solve their data and cloud infrastructure challenges. Let me expand a bit on this. Within dimension one, we are addressing the need of complex enterprise-level engagements to orchestrate individual efforts toward total productivity improvements at large teams and programs levels via all latest GenAI advances. Often to have real engagement impact, our hybrid client teams must have the same level of modern engineering maturity as purposely GenAI trained our own teams. That is why we are offering to client GenAI-enabled software development lifecycle for SDLC transformational programs, which utilizes market-leading tools and methodologies along with the EPAM AI/Run framework built on top of our own DIAL, EliteA, Codeme and some other IT assets. It makes significant impact on large complex engagements and helps to advance the adoption of AI in large-scale enterprises by bringing measurable value through both cost optimization and the creation of new revenue streams. While I believe dimension two is very much self-explanatory, dimension three is our go-to-market business transformational programs, natively enabled by GenAI and AI technology. As we move into a more comprehensive agentic propositions, our AI native engagement are starting to be picked up in volume and size. Compared to the first half of 2024, where we were generating single-digit millions of revenue from these AI-native programs, Q4 stands out by generating about $50 million in that category. Let me share two client examples to further illustrate how our efforts are driving client engagement and generating real pragmatic value. Let's start with Canadian Tire Corporation, the largest retail chain in Canada where they have embarked on a journey to standardize and modernize software delivery lifecycle. With the combined power of CTC Product Engineering Center of Excellence and EPAM know-how, we already drive an initial result with very real optimization and efficiency savings. So far EPAM has effectively deployed the EliteA platform across CTC delivery organization, trained more than 700 individuals and ensured comprehensive adoption of new modernized tools. This is a real example of how our approach amplifies organizational productivity, reduces cost and improves in-team and cross-team collaboration and serves as a foundation for the next-generation Agentic platform for SDLC. Another notable example of real progress at scale is our expanded engagements with Baker Hughes, one of the world's largest oil fuel services, industrial and energy technology companies. We are enabling Baker Hughes in building and offering to their clients large AI native digital platforms by combining EPAM best-in-class project engineering capabilities with Baker Hughes' expertise in energy technology. Just a few weeks ago, Baker Hughes named EPAM as a key partner for digital and AI to transform the energy sector by leveraging advanced AI native digital platform implementations at scale. We believe EPAM is one of the few AI-native service providers who can demonstrate scaled programs with proven AI ROI today, which is also well enabled by our growing global partnerships with cloud and data major providers with whom we are expanding our collaborations and focusing on general and Agentic AI growth to marketplace. Now, if we step back and look at the bigger picture more broadly for 2025 and beyond, our thesis remains unchanged. We believe the demand for advanced AI native and agentic software and data engineering services will only increase as engineering productivity gains will be significantly outsized by incremental demand to build new and replace the legacies as clients are quickly expanding their focus to solve more complex tasks more efficiently. Further, the need for security modernization and managing enterprise data platforms will continue to demand skilled expertise that combines critical AI skills with modern engineering and data science capabilities, all areas in which EPAM excels. To conclude, we are pleased with our stronger than expected Q4 results and stabilization achieved during the last year. Our new AI native capabilities, data and core engineering differentiation remained evident, while they are more globally diversified today than ever before. We continue to see clients return to quality and reliable execution and we believe that is putting us into a stronger competitive position today compared to last year. At the same time, we do believe 2025 will be still a challenging and transformative year for the industry with a lot of pressure to navigate two opposite trends across our client base. One is still being driven by cost sensitivity, while another by the need to return to more discretionary spending and addressing accumulated during the last few years backlogs which means also that EPAM will be performing during 2025. This continuous margin pressures triggered by necessity to invest across several important for us in 2025 areas, such as critical skills and talent retention and development, Agentic AI and GenAI IP and tooling advancements, integration efforts of our recent acquisitions and go-to-market strategies. This should allow us to be in the right standard when discretionary demand environment will fully rebound. So while we remain vigilant to potential headwinds, we believe our strategic positioning and ongoing initiatives place us on the trajectory for sustainable performance and growth in 2025 and beyond. Let me now turn the call over to Jason, who will provide additional details on our Q4 results and 2025 outlook.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, EPAM generated revenues of $1.25 billion, a year-over-year increase of 7.9% on a reported basis, including revenues from recent acquisitions, NEORIS and First Derivative. On an organic constant currency basis, revenues grew 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. In Q4, we are pleased to return to year-over-year organic revenue growth. Organic revenues exceeded our Q4 guidance due to higher than expected new project starts, indicating modestly improving client sentiment. Due to the quarter's significant inorganic revenue contribution, I will speak to both organic and inorganic revenues as I discuss industry vertical and geographic performance. Beginning with industry verticals, I want to echo Ark's comments that, in Q4, five out of six of our industry verticals delivered sequential organic revenue growth. Only the travel and consumer vertical declined Q3 to Q4. Financial services delivered very strong growth of 15.9% year-over-year, reflecting 4.3% organic and 11.6% inorganic growth, driven by continued strength in the banking, insurance and payment sector. Life sciences and healthcare increased 8.6% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting 5.7% organic and 2.9% inorganic growth. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by clients in life sciences, including some revenues derived from new logo accounts. Software and high-tech increased 7.7% year-over-year, reflecting 6.4% organic and 1.3% inorganic growth. Consumer goods, retail and travel decreased 3% year-over-year, reflecting a negative 5.7% organic and a positive 2.7% inorganic growth, largely due to declines in consumer products and retail, partially offset by growth in travel. Business information and media declined 3.9% year-over-year, reflecting negative 4.7% organic and positive 0.8% inorganic growth. Revenue in the quarter was impacted by the previously discussed ramp down of the top 20 clients. However, sequentially, we were encouraged to see the vertical return to strong growth as we continue to build momentum. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered very strong growth of 24.8%, reflecting 3% organic and 21.8% inorganic growth. Growth was primarily driven by clients in energy, manufacturing and industrial materials with significant contribution coming from NEORIS. From a geographic perspective, the Americas, our largest region, representing 60% of our Q4 revenues, increased 11.4% year-over-year, reflecting 2.7% organic and 8.7% inorganic growth. EMEA, representing 38% of our Q4 revenues, increased 3.1% year-over-year, reflecting negative 1.4% organic and positive 4.5% inorganic growth. In the quarter, the region continued to show sequential organic revenue improvement. And finally, APAC increased 4.3% year-over-year and represents 2% of our revenues. In Q4, revenues from our top 20 clients grew 4% year-over-year, while revenues from clients outside our top 20 increased 10%. Moving down the income statement, our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 30.4% compared to 31.1% in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 32.2% compared to 33% for the same quarter last year. Relative to Q4 2023, gross margin in Q4 2024 was negatively impacted by compensation increases, including those resulting from our 2024 promotion campaign, which we were not able to offset through pricing, as well as lower profitability of recent acquisitions. The compensation increases along with lower profitability from acquisitions and negative foreign exchange impact exceeded the benefits of improved utilization and the positive impact from the Polish R&D incentive. GAAP SG&A was 17.4% of revenue compared to 18.5% in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A came in at 14.4% of revenue compared to 14.2% in the same period last year. SG&A measured as a percent of revenue is now higher in part due to our recent acquisitions running with higher SG&A levels compared to our standalone business. SG&A expense for Q4 of 2024 reflects SG&A associated with recent acquisitions as well as higher variable compensation compared to Q4 2023. GAAP income from operations was $137 million or 10.9% of revenue in the quarter compared to $122 million or 10.6% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $208 million or 16.7% of revenue in the quarter compared to $200 million or 17.3% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 24.8% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.80. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.84, reflecting an increase of $0.09 or 3.3% compared to the same quarter in 2023. In Q4, there were approximately 57.4 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q4 was $130 million compared to $171 million in the same quarter of 2023. Free cash flow was $115 million compared to free cash flow of $161 million in the same quarter last year. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which is lower compared to the same quarter last year due to our recently completed acquisitions. At the end of Q4, DSO was 70 days compared to 74 days in Q3 2024 and 71 days in the same quarter last year. Share repurchases in the fourth quarter were approximately 53,000 shares for $13 million at an average price of $241.99 per share. Moving on to a few operational metrics for the quarter. We ended Q4 with more than 55,100 consultants, designers, engineers, trainers and architects, a growth of 16.3% compared to Q4 of 2023. This was a result of recent acquisitions, which contributed nearly 6,000 delivery professionals, in addition to solid organic growth, which contributed sequential net additions of around 1,500 employees in the quarter. Our total headcount for the quarter was 61,200 employees. Utilization was 76.2% compared to 74.4% in Q4 of last year and 76.4% in Q3 2024. Turning to our 2024 full year results. Revenues for the year were $473 billion, up 0.8% on a reported basis year-over-year. On an organic constant currency basis, revenues were down 1.7% year-over-year. GAAP income from operations was $545 million, an increase of 8.6% year-over-year and represented 11.5% of revenue. GAAP income from operations benefited from the recognition of $69 million of incentives related to research and development activities performed in Poland and was negatively impacted by $31 million of severance-related costs. Our non-GAAP income from operations was $779 million, a growth of 1.8% compared to the prior year and represented 16.5% of revenue. Our non-GAAP income from operations benefited from the recognition of $45 million of incentives related to research and development activities performed in Poland in 2024. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 22.2%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $7.84. Non-GAAP EPS, which excludes adjustments for stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs and certain other one-time items, including costs associated with our cost optimization programs, was $10.86, reflecting a 2.5% increase over fiscal 2023. In 2024, there were approximately 58 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Cash flow from operations was $559 million compared to $563 million for 2023 and free cash flow was $527 million, reflecting an 83.7% adjusted net income conversion. And finally, shares repurchased in 2024 were approximately 1,854,000 shares for $398 million at an average price of $214.65 per share. Now let's turn to guidance. Before moving to the specifics of our 2025 and Q1 outlook, I would like to provide some thoughts to help frame our guidance. We have been pleased with the progress we are making on demand generation and we'll continue to prioritize revenue growth into 2025. We see stability in client budgets and some degree of shift in spending towards growth and strategic programs. In 2025, we expect flat year-over-year organic revenue growth in Q1, followed by continued improvement throughout the year. In terms of profitability for 2025, we do expect to run the business at somewhat lower levels of profitability than we have in past years. As Ark mentioned, we are investing in retaining our top talent as well as further accelerating investments in our advanced GenAI platforms and tools. Compensation increases to retain talent for future growth, combined with the limited ability to improve client pricing in the near-term and additional pressure from dilutive impact of recent acquisitions will continue to put pressure on profitability this year. However, we do expect to see improvement in our profitability levels from the first half to the second half of the year. Our guidance assumes that we will continue to be able to deliver from our Ukraine delivery centers at productivity levels similar to those achieved in 2024. Now starting with our full year outlook, revenue growth will be in the range of 10% to 14% with an inorganic contribution of approximately 10% for 2025. Foreign exchange is expected to have a negative impact of 0.9%. We expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 9% to 10% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24%, our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation will also be 24%. For earnings per share, we expect the GAAP diluted EPS will be in the range of $6.78 to $7.08 for the full year and non-GAAP diluted EPS will be in the range of $10.45 to $10.75 for the full year. We expect weighted average share count of 58.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For Q1 of 2025, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.275 billion to $1.290 billion, producing year-over-year growth of approximately 10%. Our guidance reflects an inorganic contribution of 11.4% with a 1.4% negative FX impact during the quarter. For the first quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 6.5% to 7.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%. Our Q1 income from operations guide reflects the impact of resetting social security caps, the negative impact of 2024 compensation increases, which we were unable to offset with better pricing, dilution from recent acquisitions, and a slightly softer revenue in the month of January as clients in certain verticals finalize budgets. For the first quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 6.5% to 7.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%. Our Q1 income from operations guide reflects the impact of resetting social security caps, the negative impact of 2024 compensation increases, which we were unable to offset with better pricing, dilution from recent acquisitions and slightly softer revenues in the month of January as clients in certain verticals finalize budgets. We expect a weighted average share count of 57.7 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for 2025. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $194 million with $50 million in Q1, $44 million in Q2 and $50 million in each remaining quarter. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $68 million for the year with approximately $18 million in Q1 and $17 million in each remaining quarter. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately $1 million loss each quarter. Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be approximately $61 million for the year, was $17 million in Q1, $14 million in Q2, and $15 million in each remaining quarter. We expect excess tax benefits to be around $14 million for the full year with approximately $7 million in Q1, $2 million in Q2, $1 million in Q3 and $3 million in Q4. Severance, driven by our 2024 cost optimization program is expected to be $6 million in Q1 and $1 million in Q2. Finally, one more assumption outside of our GAAP to non-GAAP items. We maintain a significant level of cash and are generating a healthy level of interest income. However, based on the reduction in cash resulting from the recent acquisitions, we are expecting interest and other income to be smaller in 2025 compared to 2024, with around $18 million for the 2025 full year, with $4 million in Q1 and Q2 and $5 million in each remaining quarter. My thanks to all the EPAMers who made 2024 a successful year and will help us drive growth throughout 2025. Operator, let's open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Your line is open.
Maggie Nolan: Thank you. Jason, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the expectations that are embedded in the top end and the low end of revenue guidance and both company specific and from a macro perspective?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So I think we've been fairly careful about our expectations for NEORIS and FD. We both generally delivered at the level of revenues that we expected in Q4. We have them both with some modest degree of growth as we go from 2024 to 2025. And then as I think we said in the prepared remarks is that we've got effectively kind of a zero to 4% revenue growth for organic. And if you introduce the foreign exchange headwinds, you've got a 1% to 5% growth, again, using an organic constant currency. Right now, what we're seeing is a somewhat slow start in January, but we're seeing substantial program starts and clients are beginning to really get started here in 2025 as we enter February and as we work through the month. If I were to talk about that and Maggie is this for revenue or is this for the revenue and -- the revenue? Okay. So what we would have is clearly some degree of sequential growth Q1 to Q2. We are seeing substantial sort of project starts in certain areas of our business and we've got a couple of clients, one particularly in sort of high tech that we expect to show substantial growth in the year. Again the 4% is clearly some degree is sequential revenue growth in the back half of, yeah, if you were to end up in the middle part of the range, it's kind of a softer sequential growth. So I'm not certain that helps too much, but what we are seeing is, it's very strong sort of program starts in customer demand here in February despite the fact we had sort of a slower start to January.
Maggie Nolan: Thank you. That's helpful. And then on the margin side, Arkadiy, you mentioned that some investments that you are clearly going to be making. I'd be particularly interested in some of the commentary around Agentic AI and IP since IT services companies don't typically retain a significant amount of the IP that they generate? And then how are you thinking about balancing those investments with perhaps the need to drive some cost synergies in these acquisitions that you just onboarded?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So let me just do a quick bridge on adjusted IFO and then I'll probably let Ark talk a little bit more about the importance of the investments in GenAI. Okay, we've got a 2024 at 16.5% adjusted IFO. At the midpoint of our guided range for 2025, that would be 15%. We've talked about dilution due to the acquisition of FD and NEORIS. Both of them are accretive from an EPS standpoint, but they are dilutive from an adjusted IFO. And so I think that while we've updated our assumption and that's about a 60 basis point dilution, so 16.5% with the 60 basis point dilutive impact of the acquisitions we're down 15.9% and then 15.9% compares to the 15%, which is the midpoint of the 14.5% to 15.5%. And what we're seeing is some incremental investment in GenAI, which is causing both an increase in SG&A and a little bit of decrease in gross margin. And then, Maggie, as we've kind of talked throughout 2024 and I think also as we've talked about what we expected in 2025, we have been focused on retaining our top technical talent. And so we have had some degree of cost increases or increases in compensation in 2024 in a year when it was very difficult to get rate increases. We still expect that this is a more challenging certainly in the first half of 2025. So what we are expecting to have is our traditional promo campaign in the first half of 2025 with limited ability to offset those compensation increases with salary increases. We do expect the pricing environment to improve somewhat throughout the year. Clearly, we're focused on utilization and pyramids and that type of thing. But really what is happening in the 15.9% to 15% is some amount of compression due to price sensitivity with clients. India still runs at better than average profitability. Ukraine still runs at high levels of profitability. So we feel good about the business overall, but just the pricing environment still is kind of pressurizing our gross margin and ultimately our adjusted IFO.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think this type of investment is not something new for us. Typically when there is a visible transition in technology and we will understand that investment in GenAI is a lot of investment in training, changing the mind of our development team how our new software will be built. And on top of this number of accelerators and some IP as well specifically in this transitional period when market itself is not bringing too many stable solutions to build new type of software. And we did it like when cloud conversion was happening with mobile conversion was happening and it was significant investment, it was better macro environment back then. But we do believe that we cannot miss this investment right now because as soon as the GenAI, AI, Agentic AI starting to drive real transformation, we need to be ready and take advantage there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Jamie Friedman: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask one question. In terms of your prepared remarks, Arkadiy, you say and I'm quoting, in 2025, clients will balance their cost focus with the need to accelerate their transformational GenAI journeys. That to me sounds like kind of a change the business versus run the business narrative. I'm just wondering, in the context of your pricing commentary, is the pricing, do you have any exposure to the run the business opportunities? Is it all really the change the business transformational side, whether it's GenAI or otherwise? And is the pricing pressure that you're feeling on the new stuff or on the old stuff or both? Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Well, we definitely have, during the last several years, exposure to run the business and we have a number of engagements. And even this we're trying to do differently than traditionally it was executed, especially with everything what we're seeing in very different level of automation driven by our generic progress. But the pressure, pricing pressure coming still during the last several years and there is a big kind of inertia to change it and that's what we quote it will be start happening in 2025 more visibly, but there is a pricing pressure across run and build as well and change as well until again the change will become much more coming to more traditional levels of demand.
Jamie Friedman: Okay, thank you for that. I'll jump back in the queue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Bryan Bergin: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thank you. On-demand, I was hoping you could dig in more on how the client spending behavior progressed through each month in 4Q. I'm really trying to dig into commentary on new clients versus existing clients. So can you talk about that in any interesting bookings there or anything like that as you look at new versus existing?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I don't think I can give you like specific numbers, but definitely we enter in good number of new clients. It's not becoming very large right away, but there are some clients which quickly go into the range of kind of annualized $10 million. So at the same time, there are lot of new clients which are coming through GenAI kind of proof-of-concept and then starting to scale. But I also would probably mention that for us, right now, new clients, sometimes it's our old clients as well because for the time when starting from the beginning of the war, it was a lot of the clients]. We've seen return of these clients. Not fully, but visibly and for example, what Jason mentioned, one of the big tech companies which almost went to zero now starting to really scale. So which we consider in some way a new market that we prove again and prove not only would be prove, but that they come back to us because they need the quality level and understanding of the technology which we possess.
Jason Peterson: Hey, Bryan. So I'm just going to introduce a couple of numbers here. So the guide was $1.205 billion to $1.215 billion. NEORIS performed as expected. We said that we would do about $54 million with NEORIS. FD would have been incremental to that and I can tell you that, that was about $12 million again as we expected. So if you added the FD to the guide, it would have been 12.17 to 12.27 and we landed 12.48. And so it clearly was in what we call our standalone business where we saw strength. We did see sequential growth in Europe. We did see improvement in financial services, including growth in European financial institutions. And so overall it was quite a bit stronger quarter from a revenue growth standpoint than we had expected, particularly with good revenues in the month of November and December.
Bryan Bergin: Okay, very good. I appreciate all that detail. And Jason actually on the margin too for my follow-up here. So thank you for the bridge. Obviously, a lot of moving parts here with the R&D tax credit, but then the acquisition margin profiles, incremental investment and a different geo footprint. But as we kind of just think ahead, as demand ultimately normalizes, do you anticipate a return to profit levels where you've been before or is it too early to make that call?
Jason Peterson: Yes. We are definitely expecting to see improved profitability in the second half of the year relative to the first half. And then clearly we're looking to drive profitability back to what I would call more typical. I know some externally think about 17% plus. I've always sort of thought of us as a 16% to 17% company. And so the focus on getting back to a 16% or better would certainly be a goal for the company. And again with a slightly different environment, we think that's achievable.
Bryan Bergin: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.
David Grossman: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I'm wondering maybe if you could speak a little bit of your capacity and your ability to accelerate revenue growth once demand improves? And maybe in part of your response, you could help dimension what the headwind we should expect from the bill rate dynamic from geographic mix shift in '25 and how much that may be impacting the growth outlook.
Jason Peterson: Okay. So in terms of our ability to grow revenue, we have continued to sort of operate with a strong sort of talent capability. So we feel good about our ability to grow in India. We feel good about, obviously, our ability to grow in our traditional Eastern Europe and our ability to grow in the Americas. We are beginning to see some return and we are seeing a little bit of growth even in places like Ukraine, obviously, depending on how things resolve themselves there, that could open up further demand for that geography. And so I think, David, we feel good about the opportunity to kind of grow revenues across a broad range of geographies. I do think you are going to continue to see a little bit of this headwind that we talked about in 2024, whereas you shift into, let's say, Latin America with kind of local to local kind of revenues with NEORIS, some further growth in India and growth in places like kind of [indiscernible] which is an attractive price point where you'll continue to see a little bit of compression. I don't want to say compression, but you'll continue to see some headwinds on the revenue per headcount number as we move through 2025 would be my expectation.
David Grossman: Okay. And did you provide just some color into what you think the mix shift headwind is to revenue growth in '25?
Jason Peterson: We did not. We talked about it last year. This year, I think it clearly it depends. And I think that the answer is that, what I would say is we are beginning to see somewhat broader demand. Clearly, you continue to see more growth in India, but we are beginning to see demand for our more traditional kind of Eastern European geographies as well. So maybe I would say it's somewhat less of an impact than what I talked about in the middle of 2024, but I would say you'll continue to see some impact from that, but I haven't sized it.
David Grossman: Okay, great. Thank you for that. And then just in terms of the margins, I think you've already given a lot of color there. One thing you didn't mention was, again, any headwinds from diversifying your geographic capacity. I'm just wondering what impact, if any, that's having on the margins currently. And just curious whether there's anything unique about your specific ability to price versus wage increases versus your peers because I don't think your peers are seeing quite as much impression as you may be experiencing currently or in 2024 and your expectation for '25.
Jason Peterson: Yes. I think one of the things is that we continue to focus on retaining talent and our attrition continues to decline throughout 2024. So our voluntary attrition right now is definitely in the single-digits. As I think Arkadiy could probably talk better than I could that we do think what has made us successful over time is really the ability to deliver base with very high quality talent. We do want to make sure we're able to retain that talent, particularly as we head towards a time where we think there is going to be more transformative programs. We are beginning to see some clients come back to us where they've had either failures or fatigue with other providers. We still think that the quality of execution is important and we do think that there's an opportunity to improve price over some period of time, but I'll let Ark talk about the talent.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. And David this is what we mentioned in our remarks. So there is kind of double movements. And again our exposure changes proportionately much higher than many of our peers. And I think we try to make sure that we have the right talent to come back when demand will be normalized. So and, yes, there is pressure there. When we were relocating people, so we were relocating this to some of them to other countries in Central Europe, some of them to West and Central Asia and there is a very different pricing points. We're trying to keep the right balance and create opportunity to grow in each of these locations.
David Grossman: Great. Thanks for that, Arkadiy. Just any thoughts on the cadence? You said margin is better in the second half than the first half? And any other color you want to provide around that?
Jason Peterson: Yes. I would just say, probably Q1 to Q2, you wouldn't see a substantial improvement in gross margin, but we are taking the classic sort of steps to improve profitability throughout the year. That's all the things we've been talking about, improvement in utilization, improvement in pyramid and then some amount of scaling. And so we do want to be prepared for us, do we want to exit 2025 with an ability to drive closer or above that class profitability target of 16% or above.
David Grossman: Got it. Great. Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I'm looking at this previous year where our profitability was increasing.
David Grossman: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Jason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one is just on revenue. I wanted to dive in a little bit just in terms of what's embedded in terms of assumptions on further improvement in discretionary spending. Obviously, you've started to see some pickup and I'm wondering if the slope of that line, if you will, does that need to improve to get to, say, the midpoint or the high end of the revenue guide? What's the underlying assumption there that you've built in?
Jason Peterson: So the -- what does it take to get the high end of the range and what's our assumption on improving discretionary environment?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we -- growth portfolio we see and this is what we were sharing like during the previous call, we see some discretionary change, which very different than 12 months ago. And we saw it in Q4 and we're saying this is right now in Q1. The challenge here that the pricing environment is still challenging. Again we mentioned this. And how is it going to change? We need to see, but on positive side, this is exactly what we expect to the high range if this is starting to happen because there are already interesting proofs of businesses, advantages once they started to do quality transformations, quality scale, more scale programs GenAI related, so that it will drive the others and pricing together with this. So this is more like our high end assumption.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay.
Arkadiy Dobkin: We don't count it on a huge change, but we count it on some more pragmatic views of the companies which would like to run change programs. And we saw already when the pricing was actually to the point in many programs where the vendors couldn't deliver. So this is already built up as a very good argument to do it differently.
Jason Kupferberg: Just A follow-up on the margin. So I guess wage inflation is eclipsing pricing this year. I think you said margins down about 90 bps on an organic basis. I was curious just which countries are driving some of that wage inflation you mentioned as you're investing to retain the talent?
Jason Peterson: Yes, I would generally say it's probably more of what I would refer as the offsite countries. Again, it would be hard for me to be specific on one country or another. What you're just seeing is, again, a focus on retaining top technical talent in an environment where it continues to be hard, as Ark said, to pass on price increases. So again, I would generally view it as, we've been fairly careful on the expense of onsite talent, but it really is more in the delivery locations outside of the US and Europe.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And technology talent specifically with ability to understand what's the new SDLC [indiscernible] ability to work in this enabled by GenAI and solutions enabled by GenAI. This is becoming very hard property and again trying to build a company which is prepared for this demand, that's a retention thing which we need like to focus exactly right now.
Jason Kupferberg: Thank you, Ark.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Darrin Peller: Hey, good morning, and thanks, guys. When we exclude the couple of acquisition, it does look like your organic headcount growth inflected for the first time in some time. So maybe a bit more color on your hiring plans for the year, geographies you plan to hire, any maybe specific skill sets? And then just as an attached question to that, geopolitically, obviously, no one knows where things are going from Ukraine, Russia standpoint. But if we were to see any change around the war and any change in terms of abilities for multinational to operate in those areas more, your headcount is still, I mean, you still have a decent headcount in Belarus and Ukraine. Just remind us the mix of where your headcount is going forward for this year? And if that could impact you guys in any way from a margin or labor optimization standpoint of where you guys already have some headcount?
Jason Peterson: Okay. So just as a reminder, we had net headcount additions that was organic in Q3 of 2024 that was somewhat less than 1,000, but still again a decent number of additions. We're about 1,500, as I indicated in Q4 again on an organic kind of basis. And of course, we had the incremental from FD and NEORIS. And then for Q1 of 2025, we're also expected to be something approaching 1,000, and probably a little bit below based on kind of the slower start to the January month. So we are definitely adding headcount. As I think we've talked about, although I'm not going to be specific about which countries is that we are beginning to see kind of demand return to certain geographies in Europe. We'll clearly still be growing in India, we'll clearly still be growing in [Technical Difficulty]. We still -- we have seen a declining headcount in Belarus on a year-over-year basis and a modest decline in headcount in Ukraine on a year-over-year basis. But actually we did see a little bit of growth played in Q4 in Ukraine. And in a resolution to the conflict, we think that could make clients more open to putting more projects, programs, particularly into Ukraine.
Darrin Peller: Okay. So I guess we'll have to see how it goes. But I imagine from a margin standpoint, some of those comps, some of those labor forces that you guys have could be helpful from just relative to the mix you had in other markets you've got to build out? And then I guess --
Jason Peterson: Yes. Let me just quickly -- that's a very good point. Yes. Okay. Ukraine is historically and continues to be one of our most profitable geographies.
Darrin Peller: Okay. Thanks. Just a quick follow-up. I think you've seen somewhere around 400 basis points or 500 basis points improvement or increase in fixed contract percent, if I'm not mistaken, over the last couple of periods. Maybe just the overall trend, if you could just give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing there and the driving time?
Jason Peterson: Yes, so we've got probably three things. Okay. One is that we are growing in the Middle East, which tends to be more of a fixed fee environment. And so a little bit of the mix shift there. Okay. We are seeing some more consulting-led programs where there's more of a consulting engagement and then the tail associated with the build. Those oftentimes have kind of a fixed fee component. And we probably have a little bit more kind of managed service or fixed monthly fee. And again that would obviously contribute to the mix of fixed fee business as well.
Darrin Peller: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Jonathan Lee with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.
Jonathan Lee: Great. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you help us understand what's contemplated across your outlook range from a vertical perspective? Any verticals expected to accelerate versus decelerate throughout the year?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it's pretty much in line with what we see during the last year and quarter. So life science and at this point financial services are showing good dynamics. So and we're still not sure about retail, for example, and business information recovery because it was a big hit by the client which we pulled it last year.
Jason Peterson: And then subcomponents that were emerging, including energy would probably be areas of growth as well.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. In general it seems like across most of the verticals we expect in the growth, yes.
Jason Peterson: And then I think the only other point is that we do expect to see an acceleration in tech. And we are certainly seeing an improvement there in Q4 and do expect to see an improvement in [Technical Difficulty].
Jonathan Lee: Understood. And look recognize that the pricing environment is somewhat challenging, but what in your view would catalyze a potential return to a better pricing environment?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we see in some spots where clients are actually starting to focus more on change and in these programs, they also understand that pricing should be changing. And we see in these examples, we just need broader of this. And again that's a previous answer what we're thinking about our high range to achieve. This should be happening by that. So let's see what market will be showing right now.
Jonathan Lee: Appreciate the color.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay, thank you very much for joining us today. I think we're really satisfied how we finished the year and each year starting from some new unknown because with that you're feeling much better what's going to happen. I think we have a pretty good -- we -- I would say feeling about how this year is starting from the client communications point of view. We're also trying to be very pragmatic with our annual guidance and let's talk in three months. Thank you very much.
Operator: That concludes our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now all disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-07 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by my name is Bella, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the EPAM Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn over the call to Mike Rowshandel, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Mike Rowshandel: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. As the operator just mentioned, I’m Mike Rowshandel, Head of Investor Relations. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company’s third quarter 2024 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today’s call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today’s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company’s earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. It’s good to share today that our third quarter results came in better than expected, reflecting our strong execution, core differentiations and continued value and relevance across our global portfolio of clients. Further, we have been busy since its forecast is signing two large acquisitions announced on Friday of last week we closed NEORIS, which is the most significant addition in our history. From a strategic perspective, the acquisition of NEORIS does three things for us. Number one, it gives us an entry point into attractive new markets in Latin America and parts of Europe. Number two, accelerate net new growth opportunities with our joint clients and brings significant new logos to our clients’ portfolio. And number three, creates a powerful and unified NEORIS delivery platform in the region, which we believe will be highly regarded across Latin American and Spanish and Portuguese speaking world in general while strengthening our services with local and near-shore value propositions. We will be talking more about it a bit later today, but first, let me share some key highlights across our business. During Q3, we delivered revenue growth both year-over-year and sequentially. We saw broad improvements in client engagement across all our verticals and geographies, which we believe demonstrate what we hope to be a more stable overall market outlook. The level of our performance in Q3 was driven by increased client trust and are now much more globally diversified capabilities and in our ability to continuously execute with a high level of quality. That triggered a better-than-expected client willingness to increase their budget share results. Key verticals to call out includes life science and healthcare, emerging markets and notably financial services and software and biotech, which both returned to sequential growth this quarter. In addition, we are seeing further signs of stabilization within business information and media and consumer goods, retail and travel, while clients still continue to navigate mix dynamics in their own end markets. Today, we are encouraged to see first a more positive demand sentiment in both our existing portfolio and new acquired clients in comparison with 90 days ago. Secondly, we are very pleased with our ability to maintain our reputation as a go-to partner for technology-led optimization and transformation programs while continuously expanding our unique offering in product and platform engineering services and advanced data cloud and general capabilities. To summarize, we remain optimistic about certain sectors of our target market and about our broader portfolio as well to return to higher levels of growth over the coming quarters. So we are continuing to strategically invest in referencing capabilities and capture increased market share in global demand returns in full. However, currently, we do still see broaden up caution and some delayed decision-making with a continued focus on cost optimization. With all of that, we are staying very close to our clients and adapting ourselves to meet their most critical needs, while they continue to assess the investment appetite, prioritize transformational efforts, address their own end market conditions and most likely think about a variety of [indiscernible] navigating around the world as we speak. As we stated many times in the past, our global delivery strategy is focused on becoming the most diversified company in our industry from a global talent perspective. And based on that, on enabling us further to support our global clients and their new transformative business models realization around the world. We believe we are successfully executing this strategy by investing both organically and through acquisitions, into building new advanced capabilities and service reference is key for us, talent markets. As a result, currently, we focus on four major global delivery hubs in [indiscernible]. In Europe, we continue to remain highly differentiated in helping our clients to address their most complex business and technological challenges. Our core engineering DNA remains very strong and intact. As you can see with our better-than-expected Q3 results, we continue to deliver this high quality across existing clients as well as the new logos from our European delivery hub which operates around more than a dozen countries, including our largest in Ukraine and mainly with European Union zone. With the recent signing for derivative will further strengthen our future footprint in Europe with addition of user resourcing, especially for our financial services clients, but not limited to just those. We will be ready to talk about it in more details when we close the transaction later in Q4. In India, we are very pleased with our level of growth based on demand for differentiating services and division which has more product engineering focus compared to majority of other service players. Our investment dating back to 2015 are paying off now. Today, we see robust growth in the country. And just this year, we added over 2,000 professionals and expect India to reach the 10,000 people by early 2025. In Latin America, we are following the similar process as India, investing in building for the future from 2015 as well. As mentioned already, on November 1, we completed the acquisition of NEORIS. This acquisition represents a significant milestone for our company and will really scale up our global capabilities with local leadership, knowledge, depth and expertise. Now with NEORIS, we immediately doubled our delivery footprint to approximately 7,500 people, notably expanding our presence in Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil among other countries in LatAm, but also in Spain and Portugal. Really strong client portfolio and therefore relationship clearly demonstrate the market differentiation in the region. In addition to strong application development system implementation, cloud migration and automation NEORIS as well has developed very strong data AI and SAP practice. Today, NEORIS is recognized in Latin America, a regional market leader in SAP. It brings over thousand practitioners globally to our current effective practice and further enhancing our core enterprise platforms value proposition. Finally, they bring strong local capabilities across many of our key verticals and also in manufacturing and telco globally. In Western Central Asia, we’re continuously building a relatively new delivery hub in addition to the previous three. Today, we have nearly 7,000 people in the region who are representing all our major global technology practices. We have a very healthy mix of strong senior talent along with a more junior energetic young population, hungry for new opportunities and future growth. Now let’s turn to important target that remains top of mind for many, Gen AI. Last quarter, we talked about how our AI transformation approach is a three-dimensional. We mentioned one is internally focused and represents what we do for ourselves. It’s a parenteral transformation of generate talent using our own skill-based organization tools and methodologies, which is a key differentiator for us and deliver to our highly advanced and mitigated trainings, boot camps and other upscaling efforts. In this category also everything related to our efficiency and productivity advanced in back office and internal processes. Dimension 2 is also centered around client transformation opportunities and Gen AI-enabled client Solutions, which encompasses our Gen AI platforms and methodologies, such as EPAM DIAL, EPAM AI/Run and EPAM EliteA. And finally, dimension 3 is all about partner ecosystem network, helping us to enable life transformation of Gen AI-driven programs when closed preparation is cloud data and other type of major digital partners, must be in place for success. All those dimensions are closely interconnected. And currently, we continue to make very solid progress across all three of them. However, for today, we would like to focus a bit on combination of dimension 2 and 3 to illustrate how our efforts are driving client engagements and generating real pragmatic value. Throughout 2024, EPAM has seen very strong arrangement with most of our clients across the full spectrum of Gen AI initiatives. For such programs cover all our core capabilities in engineering, including our specialized AI enabling services, internal and external platforms and accelerators. Such programs also often include business consulting services with our approach to holistic business redesign and optimization, an experienced consulting including implementation of our Gen AI interactive assistance by helping to bring AI to customer service operations across all our major verticals. When you look across our top 100 clients, we are directly engaged with about 70% of them on different type of Gen AI initiatives. If we look at those from the size and maturity perspective, we will see inconsistent and expected picture. So far this year, we saw a doubling of what we call Stage 1 of early-stage projects compared to last year, where we are demonstrating our ability to help our clients start their journey and quickly get to Stage 2 or midsized AI projects with defined outcomes. This engagement are characterized by a more clear road map and defined top and bottom line outcomes based on vertical horizontally driven requirements. Stage 3 is where we are starting to see the readiness to focus on Gen AI and AI enable transformations more broadly. These engagements are multiyear and multimillion dollar programs and combines our data factory construct with new Gen AI capabilities to scale. Our most transformative work this year has involved establishing large-scale AI ecosystems or AI factories within our client organization. Those are comprehensive enterprise-level solutions where we might manage the entire product life cycle, which includes complete separation of models and integrated services. During this year, we have already been engaged in a few of these programs which are sizable and could be in terms of millions of dollars range, which we believe will grow much faster in 2025. Now let me share a few client examples. Let’s start from the story, which was being fished just a few days before almost in real time on the main stage as regarding [indiscernible] in Barcelona, where our team presented jointly with our client Record, a global manufacturing of health and nutrition products. This program is a large multiyear data transformation story that started with an organization ready for a variety of AI use cases. We really covering the full life cycle transformation from data foundation to data governance, platform strategy and the construction of responsible AI framework, setting the stage on operating and business model transformation for this 200 years old, 50,000-person company. Another story that we briefly mentioned 3 months ago is different. It is continue making strong progress into the future. In collaboration with International Monetary Fund back in 2023, we built the first version of StatGPT the platform that allowed users to talk about world economic and financial data using major language. It was developed based on our EPAM DIAL and EPAM Quanthub IP. As a cornerstone for the next-generation conversational data exploration and little solution for economists and statisticians. Since then, StatGPT was presented in numerous global SDMX events, where SDMX is a set of technical standards established by European Central Bank, Eurostar, IMF, United Nations Statistical Division, World Bank and other government and semi-government agencies. This month, we delivered the next version of StatGPT 2.0, which significantly improves the way users access the world global economic data and can seamlessly guide users to the specific data they need. Just now StatGPT went over the evaluation process, which included eight large publicly available data sets from international and national statistical agencies and was conducted by more than 100 representatives from SDMX sponsored institutions and national statistical organization. In result, this month, it will be presented as a 2024 IMR statistical forum in DC in the session called Measuring and Implication of AI on the Economy. As an alternative data access simplification platform for SDMX user’s community globally. To conclude, we are pleased with our stronger-than-expected Q3 results. Our core differentiation remains evident. We continue to deliver value, quality and excellence for our clients. We are successfully executing our global growth and our main strategy while expending market and capabilities at the same time. Finally, we continuously and rapidly upskilling ourselves in the most advanced engineering and generic capabilities. We strongly believe EPAM continues to be well positioned to capture rebound in market demand and share. Let me now turn the call over to Jason, who will provide additional details on our Q3 results and outlook.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, EPAM generated revenue of $1.168 billion a year-over-year increase of 1.3% on a reported basis or 0.9% in constant currency terms, reflecting a positive foreign exchange impact of 40 basis points. Excluding the impact of our exit from Russia, Year-over-year revenue for reported in constant currency would have increased by 1.5% and 1.1%, respectively. In addition to returning to year-over-year revenue growth, the company also saw 4 out of 6 reported industry verticals contribute positively to this growth. Along with the revenue growth, EPAM also delivered solid operating performance and profitability. Additionally, the company recognized a benefit from Polish government incentive program to further improve the company’s profitability in the quarter. During the third quarter, the company recognized $52 million of benefit resulting from government incentives the company expects to receive for qualifying research and development activities conducted in Poland. This benefit reduced cost of revenues, improving GAAP gross margin and IFO by 450 basis points. $22.9 million of the benefit pertains to incentives for activities conducted in 2023 and this amount has been adjusted out for non-GAAP purposes. The remaining $29.1 million in benefit derived from 2024 year-to-date R&D activities in Poland, improved non-GAAP gross margin and adjusted IFO by approximately 250 basis points. We expect the incentive to be recurring and estimate that the company will receive a further benefit of approximately $9 million in Q4 2024 as well as benefits in 2025 and other future fiscal years. While the poll and R&D incentive is reflected as a benefit to operating expense for GAAP reporting purposes, the effective tax rate during the 3 and 9 months ended September 30, 2024, was negatively impacted by the accounting with respect to the receipt of the incentive. Therefore, the positive impact of the Polish R&D incentive on IFO, net of the increase in the GAAP effective tax rate contributed $0.62 to Q3 GAAP EPS. For non-GAAP EPS, the contribution was $0.35. Moving to our vertical performance. Financial Services increased 3.3% year-over-year, driven by an improvement in demand from clients across fin-tech and banking. As well as continued strength in the insurance sector. The vertical also delivered solid sequential growth this quarter. Life sciences & healthcare delivered very strong year-over-year growth of 14.6%. Growth in the quarter was driven by clients in life sciences, pharmaceuticals and med-tech. Consumer goods, retail and travel decreased 4.5% on a year-over-year basis, largely due to declines in consumer products and retail, partially offset by solid growth in travel. Software and hi-tech grew 2.1% year-over-year. Business information and media declined 9% compared to Q3 2023. Revenue in the quarter was substantially impacts ramp down of up 20 clients. However, in the quarter, the vertical returned a slight positive sequential growth. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 8.5%, driven by clients in energy and manufacturing. From the geographic perspective, Americas, our largest region, representing 60% of our Q3 revenues, grew 2.9% year-over-year on a reported basis and 2.9% in constant currency terms. EMEA representing 38% of our Q3 revenues contracted 0.3% year-over-year and 1.3% in constant currency. However, the region showed ongoing signs of stabilization returning to sequential growth in the quarter. And finally, APAC increased 1.8% year-over-year or 0.6% in constant currency terms and now represents 2% of our revenues. In Q3, revenues from our top 20 clients grew 0.6% year-over-year, while revenues from clients outside our top 20 increased 1.7%. Moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 34.6% compared to 31.1% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 34.3% compared to 32.9% for the same quarter last year. Both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin benefited from the Polish R&D incentive. For non-GAAP gross margin, the benefit associated with 2023 activities has been excluded. GAAP SG&A was 17.7% of revenue compared to 16.9% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A in Q3 2024 came in at 14% of revenue compared to 14.4% in the same period last year. SG&A improvement in the quarter is a result of our ongoing focus on managing our cost base and increased efficiency in our spend. GAAP income from operations was $177 million or 15.2% of revenue in the quarter compared to $114 million or 9.9% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $223 million or 19.1% of revenue in the quarter compared to $196 million or 17% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Both GAAP and non-GAAP income from operations include a positive benefit from the Polish R&D incentive. For non-GAAP income from operations, the benefit from the 2023 activities has been excluded. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 28.1% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.1%. As mentioned earlier, the Polish R&D incentive had an adverse impact on both GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $2.37. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $3.12 compared to $2.73 in Q3 of last year reflecting a $0.39 increase year-over-year. Both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were positively impacted by the Polish R&D incentive. For non-GAAP diluted EPS, the benefit associated with 2023 activities has been excluded. In Q3, there were approximately 57.4 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q3 was $242 million compared to $215 million in the same quarter of 2023. Free cash flow was $237 million, compared to free cash flow of $211 million in the same quarter last year, representing our highest level of free cash flow in our history. At the end of Q3, DSO was 74 days and compares to 76 days for Q2 2024 and 73 days for the same quarter last year. Share repurchases in the third quarter were approximately 245,000 shares for $50 million at an average price of $204.32 per share. Cash and cash equivalents were $2 billion as of the end of the quarter. Moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended Q3 with more than 47,750 consultants, designers, engineers and architects, a decline of 1.5% compared to Q3 2023. However, we returned to sequential growth for the first time in nine quarters with net additions of 750 employees. Our total headcount for the quarter was more than 53,250 employees. Utilization was 76.4% compared to 72.7% in Q3 of last year and 77.5% in Q2 2024. Now let’s turn to our business outlook. In Q4, we expect demand in North America to continue to drive year-over-year revenue growth in the region. Additionally, we are beginning to see a degree of demand stability emerging in our European geography. As a result, we now expect Q4 2024 revenue to be approximately flat year-over-year, excluding the contribution from the NEORIS acquisition. Our guidance assumes that we will continue to deliver from Ukraine and productivity levels consistent with previous levels throughout 2024. As mentioned earlier, we expect further benefit in Q4 related to Polish R&D government incentives. We expect our production headcount will continue to grow in Q4 and anticipate finally returning to year-over-year headcount growth after seven quarters of decline. Moving to our full year outlook. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $4.685 billion to $4.695 billion, effectively flat year-over-year. The impact of foreign exchange on growth is expected to have a positive impact of approximately 0.2%. Our guidance reflects both improvement in organic revenues in the second half of our fiscal year plus a $54 million contribution from NEORIS for the months of November and December. We expect GAAP income from operations to now be in the range of 11% to 11.5%. And non-GAAP income from operations to now be in the range of 16% to 16.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to now be 23%, our non-GAAP effective tax rate will continue to be 24%. For earnings per share, we expect the GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.78 to $7.86 for the full year and non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $10.73 to $10.81 for the full year. We now expect weighted average share count of 57.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Moving to our Q4 2024 outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.205 billion to $1.215 billion, producing a year-over-year increase of 4.6%. On a constant currency basis, we expect Q4 revenue to increase 4.3% year-over-year. Similar to our full year outlook, our Q4 guidance reflects a $54 million contribution from NEORIS for the months of November and December. For the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 10.5% to 11.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 26% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.73 and to $1.81 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.78 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 57.2 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for Q4. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $44 million. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $9 million. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be a $1 million loss. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $14 million. We expect a tax shortfall related to stock-based compensation of around $1 million. Severance driven by our cost optimization program is expected to be $9 million. Finally, one more assumption outside of our GAAP to non-GAAP items. We maintain a significant level of cash and are generating a healthy level of interest income. However, we expect interest income to decline in Q4 due to the acquisitions of both NEORIS and First Derivative. Based on the reduction in cash resulting from these two acquisitions, we are now expecting interest and other income to be approximately $6 million for Q4. While we work our way through this cycle of stabilizing demand, we will continue to run an EPAM efficiently, positioning the company to capitalize on a more normalized demand environment. Lastly, my continued thanks to all our employees for their dedication and focus on serving our clients and driving results for EPAM. Operator, let’s open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.
Bryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. It’s good to hear the broad improvement here that you noted in client behavior over the last 3 months. Are there particular areas that are leading that recovery that you’re most optimistic about and as you just think about the discussions with these clients in recent weeks, any color you can share on early ‘25 budget discussions?
Jason Peterson: Yes. I think clearly, we’re seeing improvement in financial services. And obviously, it shows up in the results for Q3, and it’s something we would expect to see as we exit the fiscal year. It does feel like those clients have reached a point where they do need to make investments and are beginning to recognize that they’ve got to start spending again. We’re obviously seeing improvement in hi-tech and then we continue with our domain investment in life sciences and health care, we continue to see good improvement there. I don’t know that, that’s necessarily budget improvement with those clients, but probably relative success on our partner company. Probably still a little bit too early to sort of comment on what we see for 2025. But again, I think we just reiterate that there’s certainly a degree of stability and conversations feel incrementally more constructive.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. And then a follow-up, just on the Poland R&D incentive benefit here. Understanding this is expected to continue. Just all else equal, can you give us a sense of how much this will help on gross margin and just then the headwind as well on the effective tax rate as we think about refreshing ‘25 forward?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So how I think about it is that the entire benefit I guess, the $29 million for Q3, which was kind of a year-to-date number and the $9 million that we talked about Q4, all of that impacts gross margin. And so I think one of the quick takeaways is that if you just looked at Q3 and if you adjusted out Poland, we’d be at about 31.8% for gross margin on the post tax benefit, sorry, and then the adjusted IFO would still be at a quite strong 16.6%. As we look ahead, we do expect to have a, let’s call it, a similar level of kind of benefit but we continue to have that challenge where we’ve got wage inflation and the pricing environment hasn’t gotten worse I mean we do think there may be some opportunity for very modest price increases next year, but we still think we’ve got a disconnect between wage inflation and price improvement in 2025. So I think that’s still going to kind of pressurize 2025 profitability. Somewhat consistent with what I’ve been talking about over the last couple of earnings calls.
Bryan Bergin: Okay, thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Operator, we will take the next question.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Bryan Keane: Hey, guys. Congrats on the progress here. It’s good to see. Can you just talk a little bit about revenue per head, what you’re seeing there and what the outlook is going into 4Q and any kind of hiring and pickup in the European region that you guys are seeing that might be helping with the revenue perhaps.
Jason Peterson: Yes, you’re asking just about the mix is that we’ve talked about increases in headcount in Q3 and also said that we expect to see increases in headcount again in Q4, which is generally, as we’ve talked about, a positive leading indicator. We also think we’re at a point now where we’re beginning to see hiring more broadly globally. So not just in India or Latin America, but also in other geographies in Eastern Europe and Western Asia. So I think you’re beginning to see something that is beginning to kind of broaden.
Bryan Keane: And then just looking at the guidance organically. The third quarter came a little bit better than the fourth quarter guide at the midpoint. Third quarter basically being flat fourth quarter. I mean, just down slightly in the midpoint, maybe a decline of like 1.5% or so. Just thinking about the plus and minuses going from third quarter to fourth quarter, is there any things to think about or call outs in terms of tougher comps or just some conservatism as we go into the fourth quarter versus the improvement we saw in the third? Thanks.
Jason Peterson: Yes, you’ve got a significant seasonality impact between Q3 and Q4. So you’ve got more vacation, you’ve got more just classic holidays and then you also have for low impact. So that’s kind of what’s sort of in a sequential growth where you see a modest decline. The one thing I think I would call out, though, is that we have seen improved results in – clearly in Q3 versus our guidance but our Q4 results are stronger as a stand-alone business than we originally expected. So if you think about the guide that we did pre NEORIS, we talked about 45.90 to 46.5. If we adjust out the NEORIS the updated guidance would be 46.31 to 46.41. So again, with the stand-alone business, clearly, we saw better-than-expected Q3. At this time, we’re also expecting to see a stronger Q4 than we had expected when we did the Q2 earnings call.
Bryan Keane: Got it. Appreciate all the disclosures especially in organic growth. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal, Barclays. Your line is now open.
Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on the R&D incentives from Poland. And I just I’m trying to understand, is that an amount that we should think will flow into the model from here on out, I suppose, in other words, does the amount change quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year? And then secondarily, is there any other opportunity to look for incentives like that from other jurisdictions?
Jason Peterson: No, that’s a great question. And we have taken this year to evaluate opportunities, particularly as we’ve moved into somewhat more expensive geographies in Central Europe and there are some incentives that we have begun to take advantage of. And obviously, we will continue to look at that. Poland, we do think we will offer a, let’s say, a similar level of kind of benefit next year, okay? I do think at the same time, what I said earlier with Bryan is that there continues to be, I would say, not a worsening in the pricing environment, but just not an improvement in the price environment. And at the same time, we have wage inflation. So I have kind of been talking for a while about thinking about profitability in somewhat below our 16% to 17% range in 2025. So again, somewhat below 16% to 17% and I think that even with the Polish incentive, I would still encourage people to think about our business in that way, again, just because I think what you’ll see is a modest price improvement environment next year and at the same time, we will still be exposed to some degree of wage inflation.
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. A quick follow-up for me. On M&A, you mentioned continuing to strategically invest in capabilities. You guys have obviously been pretty active lately. Should we expect a similar level of activity in the quarters ahead and sort of what types of assets are you looking for?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think I don’t think we expect the same level of size impact. And in general, our approach for acquisition didn’t change much. We will also assess related to [indiscernible] but it’s function of components. It just happens that Polish just play right in our opinion during the last quarter. But in the future, we will be focusing as we lead into best [Technical Difficulty] that would be more in line with what you said before, it would be small acquisitions with specific purposes on capabilities or very specific leaders.
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Lee with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.
Jonathan Lee: Great. Thanks for taking our questions and tremendous to see the improvement in demand here. Historically, you have talked about expecting a reversion back to delivery in Eastern and Central Europe as demand picks back up. Have you seen any meaningful evidence of that in your customer conversations just yet?
Jason Peterson: We begun to see some recovery in demand for Eastern Europe.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. I think as Jason mentioned already, we are starting to carry across all locations. During the previous quarters, India was absolutely champion and Latin America was probably the second. Right now, Eastern and Central Europe becoming – is the focus for us to increase capacity, because it’s what we see in some clients, 2022 kind of trust, we stabilize it, majority ‘26, and they also much more right now for the diversified teams not only India. So, we will see how it works. Again, as we mentioned before, we don’t want to pay the infusion to large, but that’s a trend which we are seeing right now.
Jonathan Lee: Thanks for that and a follow-up. It’s good to see improvement across your top accounts. Are you seeing any shifts in the makeup of that cohort? And have there been any other changes to the type of work or again, delivery geographies that you are seeing pursued from those accounts?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. We are seeing positive changes in general from just stabilization to activation of more transformational programs. And we have seen not necessarily consistently, but much more offer when programs started to go to realization much faster than we saw several quarters ago. So, it’s again, positive movement from our side. Even now we, given a situation when suddenly plan to start as to accelerate much faster than we would expect if anyone go to it like again during the next or last couple of quarters. There is positive opinion while, again, we all need to understand that it even changes quickly, plus there are too many external factors which we foresee then we go ahead with those [Technical Difficulty] have more projections, but it’s much better, Jon.
Jonathan Lee: Thanks for that detail.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Maggie Nolan: Thank you. Could you talk a little bit about any underlying profitability improvements you have seen this quarter, either sequentially or year-over-year when you exclude the Poland related benefit?
Jason Peterson: Yes. When we have been working to obviously improve utilization, and that’s had a positive impact. You have also seen, obviously, the improvement in SG&A as a percentage of revenue. So, I think those are the two positives. And as we have been talking about, we continue to have not a pricing impact that is changing, but just we have a promotion campaign. Early in the fiscal year, we haven’t seen much price improvement throughout the year. And so when you do year-over-year comparisons, that still shows up. But we still have an opportunity to work on pyramid. And again, we are beginning to introduce more juniors as well as beginning to as Ark talked about staff a little bit more broadly globally.
Maggie Nolan: Thank you. And then could you spend a little time on your plans for integrating these acquisitions, and in particular, driving synergies, maybe some commentary around the margin profiles of these acquisitions and your plans for the trajectory there?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So, let me first say that with NEORIS, we have been specific that we expect a contribution of $54 million in Q4. And then we have not provided any direction for First Derivative, which has not closed yet. We do expect that it would close later in the quarter. But we don’t have any contribution from that acquisition in today’s guidance. From an integration standpoint, the clear focus right now is really on revenue opportunities and we are already pursuing quite actively a number of engagements where we are kind of jointly working with NEORIS as sort of NEORIS-EPAM combined to meet the needs of some existing clients and some newer opportunities. And so I would say that the first focus really is on, again, revenue growth and that’s one of the things that we think is very exciting about the combination of EPAM and NEORIS. Just to pick up the profitability question, we do expect that both of these acquisitions will have somewhat lower profitability than EPAM standalone. And so whereas we have talked about historically sort of 16% to 17%, and I have said, we would probably be a little bit below that in 2025 both First Derivative and NEORIS would likely to contribute more in sort of the low-teens. And so we will have a modestly negative impact on adjusted IFO [ph]. But again, when I guide in this sort of slightly below 16%, most of the impact really is floor in this sort of pricing, wage inflation disconnect.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think I would add that what you guys collect is these companies, we are focusing very much on the quality of probably, capabilities and quality of engineering in most cases. So, because from integration perspective, we are also very carefully focusing right now to understand deeper capabilities, deeper characters of the company because when you do the due diligence under pressure, to win these deals, time is very compressed. So, at the same time, we know there are some areas where we definitely have the business, and we understand the risk on how to improve all the financial parameters as well because like in a broad market, this company is placed today more traditional capabilities and capacity we can bring to their clients. It’s all – we will be working our opinions we have [ph] next year, because it’s not, again, right after on its kind of one plus one equal something you can collect it, but the core synergies being realized in the next couple of years.
Maggie Nolan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. Jason, can you maybe comment on margins more from a structural perspective as you think about a more diversified global delivery footprint. Anything we should be aware of there, versus maybe having a more concentrated footprint in the past?
Jason Peterson: Yes. We have talked about this, I think throughout if this is a question about India versus Eastern Europe versus Western, but is that the margin profiles of the businesses are, I think more similar than I think people understand or have believed. And so I don’t think a shift into one geography or another produces a radical change or a significant change in the profitability levels. I think what really has been kind of impactful has been both the increasing sort of seniority pyramid globally. And then just this environment that has, again, has us still do it from us in appropriate wage increases without being able to pass those done to clients. And so what Ark and I were talking about yesterday, is it with a change in the demand environment, clearly, the first thing that you would see is an improvement in revenue. And then you might see a lag in terms of the ability to also improve pricing. But we do think that, that comes eventually with a future improvement in the demand environment.
Surinder Thind: That’s helpful. And then in terms of just the pyramid at this point and the reshaping of the pyramid, is there a way that you can perhaps quantify the opportunity in terms of the seniority versus the general employees, or how we should think about that on a go-forward basis?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we need to think about it on a going basis. And the simple answer is that even pyramid, I know there is someone else, that it might depend on how demand market will change, how much it will be accelerated and across good locations, because we definitely wish a seniority, and we are doing whatever we can encouraging environment. But we think exactly how it will be benefit like 12 months from now. We need to understand how the next 12 months will look like from the demand perspective. But we have [Technical Difficulty] We have different models to address it. And we never stop our kind of educational and recruitment improvement for development. So, comfortable that we would be able to start hiring and scaling better, whether it will be necessary, specifically in the near-term component.
Jason Peterson: It is a dial that takes time to show benefit. Both the demand environment needs to be somewhat better, and then it takes some time.
Arkadiy Dobkin: But we definitely had an opportunity because our pyramid right now is more senior than in traditional back in the time. So, we have opportunity to benefit.
Surinder Thind: Thank you.
Operator: Question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is now open.
David Grossman: Good morning. Thank you. And I know you have talked quite a bit about the overall demand environment. And sorry if I missed the nuance here, but perhaps you could just repeat how much of the improvement you are seeing is macro demand-related factors as opposed to clients just becoming more comfortable with the new diversified delivery platform?
Arkadiy Dobkin: That’s a great question and almost impossible answer because mantra and geopolitics play huge work in direct. And at the same time, like any total level, I can say that what we were talking about it enterprise, then all benefits from new technology whereas of GenAI introduction that’s what we implied to understand that they need to do something now to believable for the benefits in the future. And some clients really starting to pay much more attention to data and general cloud infrastructure, not so easy and started to invest in this. We see a change versus several quarters ago, but how to quantify, it’s ready to go.
Jason Peterson: I mean there is a lot of different things that are kind of moving the needle. And maybe in some of the markets, financial services are a little bit in hi-tech. It feels like there is maybe some improvement in budget. One of the other things we are seeing, David, and we have talked about over the years is that we are beginning to see some clients return to us based on quality challenges they have had with other vendors. It’s still again on the margin. But as we do our own internal channel checks, we have multiple examples of accounts that are beginning to grow again or new logos that are growing because of clients being somewhat exhausted with the experience they have had with other vendors, or return to quality method.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. And in total basis, visibly more clients come back to us. I didn’t bid the clients to start working with those clients who decrease to a lot, starting to come back with visible level of growth, one point. And then we started to see clients which we started relatively recently and scaling up vintage [ph] for us at least kind of tens of millions in revenue annually, which wasn’t really often for us during the last 12 months, 18 months to 24 months.
David Grossman: Got it. And I just – I know you have talked quite a bit about Poland and margins and sorry again to ask this question. But just to be clear, Jason, do you want us to start slightly below the 16% to 17% level next year and then add the benefit from Poland, which would be roughly equivalent to the $38 million we got in ‘24?
Jason Peterson: So, I am glad we are having this very explicit opportunity to clarify is that we do expect to see benefits from Poland. And at the same time, I would prefer that you continue to use something slightly below 16% as you think about 2025.
David Grossman: So, slightly below 16%, inclusive of the $38 million that you would get from Poland next year, is that correct?
Jason Peterson: That is correct.
David Grossman: Got it. And sorry, just if I could sneak one last one in here. Just the headcount, I did see the headcount grew 600 people sequentially. However, it looks like 550 of those were non-IT people. Did I read that right with only 50 being IT, if I got that right, is there a reason there is such a big increase in non-production folks?
Jason Peterson: I thought we had 750 headcount that were production. So, we can go back over that with you, but now we have production headcount increases, most of the increase. And again, we expect the production headcount increase again in Q4.
David Grossman: Got it. Okay guys. Thanks very much.
Jason Peterson: Sure.
Operator: Line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Jason Kupferberg: Thank you, guys. I just wanted to come back on organic year-over-year growth. So, you were flat in Q3, you are down, call it, 1.5% in Q4 at the midpoint, but it does sound like demand is getting better. I mean is there any reason to think that you won’t return to meaningfully positive organic revenue growth year-over-year in 2025?
Jason Peterson: We would definitely expect to return to organic revenue growth in 2025. I guess the question is what’s the definition of meaningful, but yes, we are looking to return to growth next year.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. And then just on NEORIS, can you clarify what the organic revenue growth profile of that asset is as well as the client concentration, I think from CEMEX there, just given the captive model.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So, we talked about $54 million in November and December. December is usually a somewhat soft month just because of the holidays and vacations and that type of thing. And so I think if you go to take those two months and multiply it by six, you probably add a little bit to the two months to kind of get to a number. It is a growing business. CEMEX obviously is a significant customer for NEORIS and will be a significant customer on NEORIS. But it’s not a huge percentage of their business, right. It’s just a significant customer. They have got other customers in that same kind of space, let’s call it, manufacturing or materials, they also have some presence in financial services. So, again, it’s not as if CEMEX is a majority customer or anything.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. Sorry, how fast is with CEMEX – I am sorry, how fast was NEORIS growing on its own organically before you bought it?
Jason Peterson: I don’t think we have talked about that yet. And I probably won’t do it right now, but we will decide what we discuss probably as we get into next year. But again, it’s a growing business, and we have talked about in excess of $300 million, you can take the November-December. And as I said, add a little bit to it and probably multiple by six to kind of get a $0.01. But again, we are not only excited about the growth of the business, but also specifically our opportunity to grow in aggregate as we combine our two capabilities and address markets that EPAM has not historically addressed.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: At this time, I would like to inform everyone that we still have one time for one more question. Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Jain with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Puneet Jain: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, earlier this year, you talked about improving employee productivity in new regions, which were still slightly below what you had in Eastern European countries. Can you update us on LatAm, specifically with NEORIS acquisition there, LatAm being like a much larger region for you? And India, like how is employee productivity there?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, essentially would be much more comfortable to talk about it like in a couple of quarters. But based on our current assessment, we expect that engineering well is region and in many areas comparable to what we see across our centers as well. So, when you talk about productivity is how we manage these basic investments [Technical Difficulty]. This is very different metric and the best very much from the market were separate. And as you know, duration the revenues coming from Latin America, which is different markets. We hope that we will be able to impact this, but we also hope we will be served together on joint client basically of global companies operating in Latin America and of course increase opportunity and impact on our North American clients is very scalable now. So, then that’s what I feel we will need to talk about this [Technical Difficulty].
Puneet Jain: Got it. And as we think about 2025, are there any client-specific headwinds that we should consider or most of them are behind you by now?
Arkadiy Dobkin: We – as we mentioned, again, those want to predict mostly what we cannot right now. There are too many new factors even today, okay. At the same time, like we think about like what exchange reach – in the calculations like very visible to us even for Q4 right after election. So, there are a lot of sales which is unpredictable. There are [Technical Difficulty] which didn’t happen 1 year ago when we were a little bit more optimistic and we are trying to predict the future. So, let’s say, what would happen, how we saw global politics will be shaped, how it’s going to impact the market and what will pressure our plants will have to actually starting to fight the technical that which is, in our opinion, still very, very deep.
Puneet Jain: Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you very much for listening to us today. I think in summary, we would like to say again, that we reached best our Q3 results. We are also realistically optimistic how Q4 is shaping which is good. And we would like to remind, we definitely believe that EPAM continues to be well positioned and to capture rebound in market demand in the future as well. So, with this, let’s say, three months from now. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-08 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Second Quarter 2024 EPAM Systems Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And finally, I would like to advise all participants that this call is being recorded. Thank you. I'd now like to welcome Mike Rowshandel, Head of Investor Relations to begin the conference. Mike, over to you.
Mike Rowshandel: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Mike Rowshandel, Head of Investor Relations. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's second quarter 2024 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. First, I would like to start off with our second quarter results which came generally in line with our expectations. We believe our performance in the second quarter of 2024 reflects our continued strong execution and adaptability amidst a still complex demand environment. Let me share some current highlights of our business from Q2 up to today. Our underlying business continues to show signs of stabilization. In the second quarter, we delivered very strong growth in our healthcare and life sciences vertical and strong growth in our emerging verticals, where we also saw some slight sequential improvements in financial services. In some of the verticals, namely business information and media, we continue to work through the impact of the ramp downs from the few large clients we have mentioned before. On the demand environment, we do see broad-based signs of stabilization as well across both EMEA and North America. At the same time, clients are still cautious with larger programs and our visibility to a significant increase continues to be constrained by a mix of clients, cost-saving priorities, delays in program starts and clients' own business changes. As a result of this complex environment, we are currently assuming no net improvements in overall demand for the remainder of the year. Jason will provide more details of our updated outlook for 2024. To be clear, notwithstanding the overall demand picture, we are optimistic about certain sectors of our target market and our current portfolio returning to modest growth story in the next 2, 3 quarters as we see it now. In overall, while we adjust our offerings and our delivery mix to see the parameters of the current demand environment, we continue to see significant traction in our data and analytics, core engineering and digital engagement offerings, especially through the broad transformation of reach with AI, as well as increasing evidence that our consulting and advanced technology capabilities are driving new top-of-the-funnel opportunities for us. So meanwhile, we remain focused on responsibly managing our business in this part of the cycle, building on our strong fundamentals and ensuring that EPAM continues to be the partners of choice while the demand environment improves. Turning now to our global delivery strategy. In Europe, our differentiated capabilities continue to create significant opportunities for our clients to leverage the top talent on their most complex business and technical challenges. We believe this traditional EPAM advantage will continue to serve our clients well, especially as they turn from mostly cost-driven considerations back towards driving growth and innovation through the use of advanced technologies for their complex transformation and modernization efforts. We are also continuously investing in our more recently established delivery hubs across Western and Central Asia which are emerging talent markets and where we are enabling strong and experienced tech talent to responsibly lead our future growth in the region. India remains a priority and is on track to becoming our largest delivery location by the end of the year. We have built scaled centers of excellence in data and analytics, digital marketing, commerce, sales force, SAP and other key horizontal and vertical service lines. Our primary focus is on building a scaled EPAM-grade quality engineering, while blending in with many unique enterprise-level capabilities present in India and not available in most of other EPAM locations around the globe. We believe this approach will differentiate EPAM India from our clients and create strong growth opportunities for our people. We are also continuing to expand our core engineering capabilities in LatAm. In addition to Mexico and Colombia, we now have a delivery hub in Argentina. We will continue assessing and developing new local talents across the region. In each of these geos, we are investing in our existing and new technical capabilities, including crucial-for-the-future GenAI data, ML and predictive AI and in corresponding IP development. In short, we are building full-service GenAI delivery practices through a network of GenAI X-Labs [ph] across major dev centers to enable and scale GenAI-enabled client production activities. In addition, both in India and LatAm, we are evolving into strategies that includes not only differentiated delivery capabilities but also being able to offer compelling in-market presence end solutions, particularly as we seek to serve our global alliance in a more complete and strategic manner which means building locally a much stronger partner ecosystem as well. Finally, in all our locations and specifically in our major client markets, we continue to focus on our client engagement programs and to improve our consulting industry capabilities across our service offerings. Now let's turn in a bit more details on our GenAI approach. For the last decade and despite all challenges during the last several years, we are continuously a recognized leader in advanced technology, digital engineering and complete data transformation programs. This naturally extends to EPAM being regarded to the company who understands the complexities of AI transformation, something we are doing for ourselves, our partners and our clients for some time now. Today, I would like to highlight our up-to-date progress in that area and how EPAM is helping clients pragmatically initiate and then move use cases beyond pilots into production deployments. Our current approach to AI transformation is 3 dimensional. Dimension 1, EPAM internal transformation and GenAI enablement investments. We set an ambition goal for ourselves to upskill and effectively train an absolute majority of the company on the usage of GenAI fundamentals and to do so both responsibly and with the EPAM-level technical depth. A dedicated program was established to execute this. And today, with the help of our educational platforms, internal specialized tools and our global maintenance community, close to 100% of the EPAMers have gone through training and applying AI in their daily work activities. While most of the companies have announced similar programs, we believe that during the last 24 months, our early and highly focused efforts across a broad range of EPAMers allow us to better understand future opportunities and to invest in differentiated IP and accelerators around GenAI-enabled engineering solution. Our combination of training, IP and open-source style internal initiatives have now become drivers of scale in our advanced GenAI practitioner communities across all EPAM organizational unit and practices. We assume that well over 10% of EPAMers are now advanced GenAI technical practitioners, while over 1,000 are becoming strong internal AI champions with ability to lead GenAI-enabled business solutions. We believe all that has enabled our dimension 2, client transformation opportunities. Our AI client project today has evolved from exploratory pilots and proof-of-concept late last year to now EPAM being selected by clients as a primary AI partner with involvement into hundreds of GenAI-led engagements. We are helping to change the full value chain of SLDC from one side and enabling implementation of real GenAI-driven business use cases from another. Let me briefly highlight just a few IP investments. EPAM DIAL is a unified GenAI orchestration platform helping enterprises spin the experimentation and innovation efforts to implement real business use cases and GenAI-enabled solutions by connecting into meaningful workflow and load balancing a set of public and proprietary LLMs and SLMs together with different type of internal, external data sources, AI-native applications and customer dots. EPAM AI/Run is a GenAI-powered delivery framework that accelerates the entire software development life cycle and helps clients recognize ROI of their AI investments by improving time-to-market speed up to 30%. EPAM EliteA, it's a comprehensive collaboration platform for teams that streamline the development, accessibility and management of large language model assets, including prompts, templates and agents. Now a few specific examples for the clients which operate across completely different user environments. For Unity, the world-leading platform of gaming tools for creators to build and grow real-time games, apps and experiences across multiple platforms, we helped build Unity Muse. From a multi-cloud migration to Microsoft Azure to aid in GenAI capabilities to make game creation faster and easier for 1 million developers by using natural language prompts to generate sprites, textures and animations and also providing chat-based assistance and troubleshooting, as well as the ability to even create behavior trees. For XSOLIS, a leader in health care system purpose-built solutions and industry-leading AI, we helped to develop a new generation AI platform on AWS enhancing, Dragonfly, XSOLIS's flagship product. The platform provides real-time data and predictive analytics to nurses, case managers, physician advisers, utilization management and revenue cycle leaders across 500 hospitals and health systems with more than 500 payers [ph] connections. Finally, for the IMF, as a part of modernization of their data platform, we built StatGPT which is an SDMX-driven GenAI application for statistical organizations, allowing their users, economists and statisticians to truly transform, analyze, visualize and interpret statistical data using a natural language interface via proprietary talk-to-you-data framework powered by EPAM DIAL and EPAM Quanthub accelerators. Initial results showed a 50% increase in research productivity and 35% increase in research accuracy. And overall, we are seeing a significant rise of GenAI-led engagements across every vertical and a very broad set of use cases. And this is now driving transformation in both front-end customer experiences as well as significant back-office and process-related use cases. Finally, all that in turn allows us to enable dimension 3 for AI transformation, extended client network, first of all, because we saw that we are very practical in our approach. Our technology and AI transformation program are much larger and more complex today than where we started just a few quarters ago and encompasses both consulting and engineering services as well as a broader range of partnerships. With more than 150 strategic partners, we're accelerating modernization, adopting cloud-native architecture and leveraging AI and advanced analytics, particularly when our clients' projects have a high degree of technical and business complexity. We are our partners' partner of choice for making corporate engagement real. In fact, just very recently, we've been named Partner of the Year by several of our cloud data and digital partners, including Databricks' Disruption Partner of the Year, recognized for the industry-leading design and implementation of GenAI-powered conversational interfaces, state-of-the-art machine learning and large language model framework. By the way, as elite level partner, we are 1 of only 5 companies with listed in Databricks' center of excellence. Google Cloud Talent Development Partner of the Year, an award recognized for our commitment to training, upskilling and reskilling our team cloud and AI skills. Microsoft Gaming Partner of the Year, recognized for the pushing the boundaries of creativity and technology. Mark in commerce tools, recognized for delivery best-in-class modern commerce experience for our clients. It's easy to assume the next question, what is the revenue impact of these programs? I guess the answer is probably predictable as well. We are still in early days of the AI wave. But at the same time, we are very optimistic about the accelerating pipeline opportunities coming from AI-led transformation and what that can bring downstream for us as a highly trusted and valued partner. We remain focused on expanding our efforts to drive demand, remaining relevant to our clients and what they need and proactively expanding our global market share. We also remain committed to managing our delivery footprint, expanding to cost-efficient locations and generally optimizing our ways of working, so we can continue to provide premium service at attractive value to our global client base. I firmly believe EPAM continues to be well positioned to capture rebound in market demand, driven by long-term pressures for legacy modernization with needs for advanced customer-centric solution and by significant interest on how to apply GenAI and GenAI capabilities to build new platform and solutions. With this, I would like to pass to Jason to provide additional details on our results in Q2 and our future performance.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, EPAM generated revenue of $1.147 billion, a year-over-year decrease of 2% on a reported basis or 1.7% in constant currency terms, reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of 30 basis points. Due to our exit from the Russian market, we no longer generate revenue from Russian clients. The impact of this exit had an approximate 50 basis point negative impact on year-over-year revenue growth. Excluding Russia revenues, year-over-year revenue for reported and constant currency would have decreased by 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively. Moving to our vertical performance. Life sciences & healthcare delivered very strong year-over-year growth of 22.4%. Growth in the quarter was driven by clients in both life sciences & healthcare. Consumer goods, retail and travel decreased 7.7% on a year-over-year basis, largely due to the declines in retail, partially offset by solid growth in travel. Financial services decreased 5.6% year-over-year, driven by softness in asset management, banking and payments. In the quarter, the vertical delivered slight sequential growth, indicating stabilizing demand. Software and hi-tech contracted 3.7% year-over-year. Business information and media declined 12.6% compared to Q2 2023. Revenue in the quarter was substantially impacted by the previously discussed ramp down of a top 20 client. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered solid year-over-year growth of 10.6%, driven by clients in energy and telecom. From a geographic perspective, Americas, our largest region, representing 60% of our Q2 revenues, grew 1.8% year-over-year on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency terms. EMEA representing 38% of our Q2 revenues, contracted 6% year-over-year and 5.6% in constant currency. And finally, APAC declined 0.6% year-over-year or 0.2% in constant currency terms and now represents 2% of our revenues. In Q2 revenues from our Top 20 clients declined 3.7% year-over-year, while revenues from clients outside our top 20 declined 1.1%. The relatively stronger performance of this latter group was driven by both new client and inorganic revenue contributions. Moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 29.3% compared to 30.9% in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 30.8% compared to 32.6% for the same quarter last year. Relative to Q2 2023, gross margin in Q2 2024 was negatively impacted by the strengthening of currencies associated with certain delivery locations as well as the impact of compensation increases, including those resulting from our recent promotion campaign which we were not able to offset through pricing. The negative impact of foreign exchange and compensation increases exceeded the benefit of improved utilization. GAAP SG&A was 16.9% of revenue compared to 16.7% in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A in Q2 2024 came in at 14.3% of revenue compared to 14.8% in the same period last year. SG&A improvement in the quarter is the result of our ongoing focus on managing our cost base and increased efficiency in our spend. GAAP income from operations was $121 million or 10.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to $144 million or 12.3% of revenue in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $175 million or 15.2% of revenue in the quarter compared to $191 million or 16.3% of revenue in Q2 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 26.3% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.3%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.70. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.45 compared to $2.64 in Q2 of last year, reflecting a $0.19 decrease year-over-year. EPS was positively impacted by a Serbian government investment incentive received and recognized in the quarter which improved Q2 diluted EPS by $0.06. Although the benefit from this incentive was contemplated in the full year guidance communicated during our Q1 earnings call, at that time, we had expected to receive the incentive and recognize the benefit in Q3. In Q2, there were approximately 58.1 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q2 was $57 million compared to $89 million in the same quarter of 2023. Free cash flow was $52 million compared to free cash flow of $82 million in the same quarter last year. At the end of Q2, DSO was 76 days and compares to 73 days for Q1 2024 and 71 days for the same quarter last year. The uptick in DSO reflects an increase in the time some clients are taking in the review and approval of payments, combined with the last few days of the quarter falling on a weekend. Share repurchases in the second quarter were approximately 1.16 million shares for $214 million at an average price of $184.97 per share. In June 2024, EPAM completed the share repurchase program authorized on February 13, 2023. Over a period of 16 months, 2.24 million shares were repurchased at an average share price of $222.90. On August 1, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to another $500 million of EPAM common stock over a term of 24 months. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended Q2 with more than 47,000 consultants, designers, engineers and architects, a decline of 4.8% compared to Q2 2023. Sequentially, production head count remained unchanged as the company reduced head count in certain on-site locations, while continuing to hire in India. Our total head count for the quarter was more than 52,650 employees. Utilization was 77.5% compared to 75.1% in Q2 of last year and 76.8% in Q1 2024. However, on-site utilization remains below targeted levels and the company will continue to take actions to optimize on-site resource levels to improve utilization. Now let's turn to our business outlook. Although client demand has stabilized, we continue to see very little improvement in the near-term demand environment. We are experiencing growth in certain verticals, seeing relatively high levels of new logo activity and working with clients to bring GenAI programs into production. We are also beginning to see some constructive improvement in client discussions with regards to future programs. But decision-making continues to be relatively cautious as some clients continue to have challenges with their own end markets and revenue generated by individual new logo accounts is on average, less than that generated in prior years. Although we believe clients are beginning to more actively engage around new initiatives, our guidance assumes macroeconomic stability with no improvement in the aggregate demand environment for the remainder of the year. We are hopeful that change in the tone of client conversations will result in an improved demand environment in 2025. For the remainder of 2024, we are expecting a slight increase in Q3 revenue relative to Q2 driven by greater build-outs in the quarter, substantially offset by higher vacation levels. We are expecting a modest sequential decline in Q4 revenues, driven largely by some of the seasonal factors mentioned previously. We are maintaining our focus on demand generation and we'll continue to prioritize revenue growth for the remainder of 2024. At the same time, we are taking steps to improve cost efficiency and on-site utilization and now expect to operate at a higher level of profitability in the fiscal year. Finally, our operations in Ukraine continue to run at high levels of utilization, a testament to our team's dedication and focus on maintaining uninterrupted quality of delivery. Our guidance assumes that we will continue to be able to deliver from our Ukraine delivery centers at the productivity levels similar to levels achieved in 2023. Moving to our full year outlook. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $4.590 to $4.625 billion, a negative growth rate of 1.8% at the midpoint of the range. The impact of foreign exchange rate growth is expected to have a positive impact of approximately 10 basis points. At this time, we expect approximately 1% of revenue contribution from already completed acquisitions. We expect GAAP income operations to now be in the range of 10.5% to 11% and non-GAAP income from operations to now be in the range of 15.5% to 16%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to now be 21%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation will continue to be 24%. For earnings per share, we expect the GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.18 to $7.38 for the full year; and non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $10.20 to $10.40 for the full year. We now expect weighted average share count of 57.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Moving to our Q3 2024 outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.145 billion to $1.155 billion, producing a year-over-year decline of 0.2% at the midpoint of the range. And on a constant currency basis, we expect Q3 revenue to be flat year-over-year. For the third quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 10% to 11% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.83 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.73 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 57.4 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for the remainder of the year. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $45 million for each of the next 2 quarters. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $6 million for each of the remaining quarters. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be a $1 million loss for each of the remaining quarters. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $13 million for each of the remaining quarters. We expect excess tax benefits to be around $1 million for each of the remaining quarters. Severance driven by our cost optimization program is expected to be around $10 million for each of the remaining quarters. Finally, one more assumption outside of our GAAP to non-GAAP items. With our significant cash position, we are generating a healthy level of interest income and are now expecting interest and other income to be approximately $13 million for each of the remaining quarters. While we work our way through this cycle of lower demand, we will continue to run EPAM efficiently, positioning the company to capitalize on a more normalized demand environment. Lastly, my continued thanks to all our employees for their dedication and focus on serving our clients and driving results for EPAM. Operator, let's open the call up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Maggie Nolan of William Blair.
Margaret Nolan: I wanted to dig into the utilization and the dynamics between on-site and offshore. So first of all, what percentage of the workforce is considered to be on site this quarter? And then is offshore utilization running higher than what you view as sustainable to offset some of that weakness on on-site because you're not too far off from your historical range here?
Jason Peterson: Yes. The -- I think we feel that the offshore utilization is actually quite healthy. And I'm struggling right now to remember exactly what our on-site percentage is but from a total head count -- but from a utilization standpoint, it's definitely lower than we would traditionally run at. And it continues to be the area that I think we find ourselves somewhat challenged in. And so it probably is also contributing somewhat to revenue growth for the remainder of the year, where we continue to see more demand for offshore and incrementally more demand for India and again, continue to run at somewhat lower levels of utilization on site. And that's something that we are working to address, pull-through demand generation and also through taking some actions, as I referred to in my prepared remarks.
Margaret Nolan: Got it. And then somewhat related, just building on that, the improvement in the margin outlook, is that primarily related to those actions that you want to take on utilization? Are there other levers you're pulling? And have you already seen some progress here in the third quarter to fuel that optimism in the increased number that you gave?
Jason Peterson: No, absolutely. And so the focus has been on sort of cost optimization after we reset our expectations for revenue growth. So we've been more efficient in corporate functions and SG&A. We've been working on utilization. And so yes, the actions that we intended to take are underway and it is beginning to show up probably even in a little bit of the benefit that we saw in profitability in Q2.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen.
Bryan Bergin: I hear you on the overall complex demand environment. I wanted to dig in on the demand progression in the top accounts. that you saw over the last 3 months as well as just how you see the top clients, particularly the top 5 to 10 performing in the second half and as you exit this year.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think despite of the opticality of the clients for the top 5, there is only one client which is declining and this is basically a continuation of the trend which we saw before. And even this client decline, kind of getting less and getting to a more stable environment right now. So but in general, it's exactly like we commented before. It is pretty stable.
Jason Peterson: Yes. And that top 5 client, this is the one that we talked about in the past which is a European business information and media client.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just on the GenAI front, can you dig in a little bit more on the progression of GenAI-related work as far as just maybe any rough quantification on the size of some of these programs and the mix of really the POCs that are moving into production?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So it is pretty challenging, especially when we're thinking that -- we're trying to understand how some of our talents quantifying this. And it's very much all around the well. So that's why for our internal understanding and integration, we have kind of fewer GenAI-related projects and some influence revenue and so on and so on. So from this pure type of stuff, a lot of small POC now approaching high hundreds of thousand or low millions of dollars. This is already starting to happen. So -- and this is dozens in our case. And again, it's very difficult to compare apple to apple when we're hitting some numbers for competition. At the same time, from influence point of view, we started to go already to tens and upwards of hundreds of millions as well. So very different even from 6, 9 months ago.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. Understood.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Still, if you think about it, it's a very small portion of our revenue. And I think general trend that -- when during the POC, there is a confirmation, the potential ROI and excitement, then it's coming back to the technical debt which we were talking about during the last quarter. And companies realize that to actually get the benefit of this, it requires really investments and go to some data modernization program which is much needed and require much more depth. And that's actually one of the showstoppers to real progression, because they are not ready yet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research.
Darrin Peller: Could we just touch for a minute on the sequential math? Looking at the guide, it looks like the dollars of revenue expected is pretty much exactly flat or almost exactly flat going from second through the end of the year. And I know you're trying not to embed any type of upside or inflection. Just -- I know there's also some seasonality typically in Q4, although things like budget flows have been tougher lately. But maybe just touch on that for a minute in terms of your expectations on a per quarter basis. And then really just go back to the overall demand environment, where you're seeing clients spend what you think you can do that maybe must -- a little bit less related to the macro and more idiosyncratic as we've been seeing more and more IT services companies trying to really address current needs as much as possible. So anything more you can just comment on where the demand is today, especially if the macro holds at a slower level for a while, what you think you're doing that's resonating the most.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So I'll just start with the more technical, I guess and I'll leave Ark to answer maybe the harder questions. And so from a Q2 to Q3, you'd have higher vacation and more build days. And so you get a -- you should see a somewhat modest improvement but you should see some improvement in revenues just based on what you can call kind of technical or seasonal factors. And then in Q4, it will depend on what type of vacation levels we see. But usually, you would see even a little bit higher levels of vacation in Q4, lower build days. And then, of course, the question is going to be what type of furlough activity we see. So generally, there is a somewhat significant impact just due to seasonality. And so that's kind of what we're modeling at this time, again, is that generally, a very modest improvement up from Q2 to Q3 based on seasonal factors. And then some degree, a decline unless, as you said, we see some type of budget flush or again, we're able to influence the level of vacations that employees take. Ark, do you want to talk a little bit about overall demand or where we're seeing [ph].
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think our equipment, very much in line with the last quarter. So we -- as we mentioned last time that we don't -- we don't think we can project the market in current situation. So I think it's very much similar. And if quarter ago, our projection range was much broader than today, in just saying that our expectation of good news, we are not confirmed. And our expectation for the great news actually didn't happen as well. So we're narrowing and it's a reflection of the type of projects in play right now. There is no big modernization talk. There are conversations about it but it's not turning into reality. There are a lot of noise around GenAI which is not converting to big revenue as well. But around the business, keeping the status quo on production systems, that's what we're focusing, improving. And again, looking for kind of one-off modernization play where we can really bring the value but it's very competitive and again, not necessarily decided for the client right now. I don't know if I'm giving you answer that you want but...
Jason Peterson: And I would just add that we're working to change the trajectory in Europe and we are beginning to see some better conversations and opportunities kind of appear there. Again, so that's an area where we're looking to sort of, let's say, change the picture. The other thing I think you see in our fixed fee which continues to go up, we're continuing to sort of explore and work with clients to have more of a committed kind of model around what we'll deliver for a fixed fee or a fixed monthly fee and that's a reflection of what we're trying to do to respond to customer needs and win more business.
Darrin Peller: Okay. Actually one quick one just on hiring, is just on -- I mean do you anticipate -- if utilization stays in these ranges, do you anticipate needing to hire more? Or I mean, maybe AI or other types of efficiencies can help maintain?
Jason Peterson: There's certainly some programs where we're clearly working to include AI productivity improvements. But no, we would continue to hire and I think you'll continue to see hiring in the types of geographies we've been talking about which is more kind of offshore certainly with someone [ph] in Latin America.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs.
Jim Schneider: First of all, on the discretionary demand environment, it's not surprising to hear of the constraints given what the environment is out there. But what are your clients telling you about the conditions under which they would start to release more spending or more aggressive with new projects in 2025? Is that tied to macro? Is that tied to more certainty around their AI strategy or other priorities they have internally in terms of IT spending?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we do believe that majority of the kind of decision making, it's environment related right now. Because as soon as kind of situation would be a little bit better, I think investment in general data infrastructure and cloud infrastructure which was delayed will be triggered, because everybody understands the impact of GenAI. And without fixing first this, it would be very difficult know for -- so I think market is holding right now.
Jim Schneider: And then maybe just in terms of the margins, obviously you delivered good growth and operating margin leverage in the quarter. That was good to see. Was that mostly driven by the mix of head count shifting to India? Or are there other factors there besides the SG&A line? And then, I guess, going into '25, as we exit this year, what kind of further gross margin leverage do you expect to deliver or is this sustainable from here?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So we're continuing to work on utilization. And the improvement in Q2 was probably a combination of efficiency with SG&A and continued to focus on improving utilization. I think what we've talked about over the last couple of quarters is that we continue to have an opportunity because we've got a fairly heavy pyramid still including in India. And so what we need to do is make sure that we're introducing more juniors into the mix which generally has a broader sort of pyramid, it improves profitability overall, also can allow you to be a little bit sharper with pricing. But the Q2 improvement in profitability was not driven by a shift in India. Again, it was more kind of these operational kind of efficiency factors that we're continuing to work on throughout the remainder of the year.
Jim Schneider: And in terms of the forward improvement there?
Jason Peterson: Forward improvement, again, is the work that we're doing on utilization improvement, reducing the bench and ongoing efficiency in SG&A. So again, it's just a focus on certain areas of our operations that we think we can see some further sort of reduction in spend certainly as a percentage of revenue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Lee from Guggenheim Securities.
Jonathan Lee: I want to get a better sense of how India is progressing. Can you help unpack the type of volumes you're seeing there and whether expanded presence has had any sort of influence on new types of demand or types of contract structures being utilized, especially if you think about the revenue and margin dynamics that are contemplating the outlook?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So I'll let Ark talk a little bit more about the type of work in progress. What I would say is that from the last time we spoke with you, Jonathan, is that India is likely to make a somewhat -- a very slightly greater percentage of head count by the end of the year. So last time, Ark and I were talking about something approaching 20%. We now think that India will be slightly above 20% by the end of the year. And what you are seeing is a modest pressure on average bill rates as a result. And that probably is also sort of shaping how we look at the second half. So it's not super significant. But I think last time -- sometimes we would utter the word, 19.5% and right now, we think that India is going to account for just over 20% of our head count by the end of the year. So we continue to see a modest gradual shift there, while at the same time, we are seeing improved utilization in our other areas of operation, in Europe and Western and Central Asia. So it's not as if all the demand is shifting to India but we are seeing ongoing kind of increment in India. Ark do you want to talk about type of work or...
Arkadiy Dobkin: Type of work, like I think that's what we shared already today. We consider like this into India, there is a pricing pressure. So this is definitely a very objective kind of component. At the same time, the type of work which we do, not changing much from location to location. And as we said before, EPAM has a kind of reputation for more complex quality engineering solutions. And as we said, we're building actually in the very strong data renewing occupancy. We're bringing like everything that we do around GenAI, productivity improvement for SLDC. We built a digital engagement practice. So it's very much in line with the broad EPAM and the type of work is, again, very, very similar. So from overall perspective, it's also creating different profile of our breadth in India. Because when we started to move work there, we have to bring much more proportionally experienced teams there. And only after this, we will be able to scale to the different pyramid. That's what's happening for us in multi-nesting, some movement of the work, rebuilding the pyramid and still investing in -- wanting to be exactly in line with client expectations because they expect from EPAM independently from location, similar type of service.
Jonathan Lee: Thanks for the detail there. Can you unpack your comments on the lack of improvement contemplated in the outlook? I want to understand what that means for deals that have been signed but perhaps not yet launched or ramped. How much go-get or pipeline conversion is still required to achieve your outlook at both the high end and the low end?
Jason Peterson: Yes. And the last time we guided, Jonathan, we did talk about still expecting a very modest improvement in demand and what we're now saying is we don't see that improvement in demand. And so we try to be quite prudent with our guide. Clearly within this quarter and clearly, having set the full year guide which obviously is how we're thinking about Q4, it does very much -- particularly if you take the full guide of $4.590 billion to $4.625 billion, it does encompass even things like some potential reductions in demand due to cost reduction efforts at clients or that type of thing. And so I think we feel pretty confident that, again, we have a little bit of sort of downside as clients continue to be sort of cost sensitive. And then the upside probably would be a little bit more in the lighter furloughs, maybe just a little bit of kind of budget openness in the remainder of the year. And again, our ability to probably influence the level of vacation taken by employees to again, give us a little bit more capacity in Q4.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays.
Ramsey El-Assal: It looks like your percentage of fixed-price contracts has been trending up and it's a little higher now than it's been at least going back quite a ways in our model. What is driving that mix shift sort of away from time and materials work towards fixed price work? Is it geographic? Is it GenAI related? And I guess, are there any implications for margins when it comes to fixed price versus time and materials work?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So you're correct that it has been trending up and probably will continue to trend up somewhat. And so it's a mix of what would we call percentage of completion and what is sort of a fixed monthly fee. And so it probably does reflect the fact that we're beginning to try to address clients' needs in a way that's a little bit on traditional prepay where we have traditionally been kind of more bleeding-edge complex projects where it was difficult to estimate. We clearly have that type of work but we are trying to be able to sit with our clients and say we can do this for a fixed amount of money or fixed amount of money on a monthly basis. The other thing I think you are probably seeing is some opportunity with GenAI to introduce not only traditional sort of productivity improvement or productivity improvement from GenAI and commit to a series of savings over a period of time. And so you are seeing us also enter into engagements with clients. It may be more a multi-quarter or in some cases, even multiyear that do reflect what we believe is a productivity improvement that we can achieve over time. And that could go either way, right? It can be net positive to margins. If obviously, we've misestimated or sort of delivered poorly, it could be negative. But generally, with fixed fee, you do have the opportunity to improve profitability relative to time and materials because it just gives you more flexibility in how you deliver.
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And a follow-up for me on M&A. I guess, given the buybacks in the quarter and the additional share repurchase authorization, is larger scale M&A off the table? Assuming you're still in the market for tuck-ins to plug capability gaps, what types of assets might you be looking to bring into EPAM?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think nothing is off the table. So as always in the past, we constantly have conversations and opportunities for different sizes of acquisitions. And -- by insurance back is actually very much functions of if it's going to happen or not. So it's not must condition, it's a direction which we will be executing only if we think that we will ramp up with any other aspects of the business. So if the M&As will be happening, we will be adjusting the numbers, if necessary.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So we'll do both. But clearly, our bias would be towards acquisitions. And as Ark said, doing something somewhat larger, certainly not off the table.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Surinder Thind of Jefferies.
Surinder Thind: Just a question around the global delivery footprint. As you look ahead, if revenues was to remain stable, at what point do you think you'll get to your target delivery footprint?
Arkadiy Dobkin: When you say it will be stable, what do you mean? So...
Surinder Thind: Assuming -- I think there was commentary on the call about on-site utilization being a little bit below expectations. And so there's continued shift for the requirement of resources in lower-cost regions. I think there's previous commentary around maybe not as much demand in nearshore or Western Europe shifting some of those resources through natural attrition to other parts of the world. So that was the -- what I was trying to get at.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think -- let me try to answer slightly differently. First of all, we definitely move into global diversification from indications of stability and 24/7 on the growing global climate. And from this point of view, we will be much more diversified than in the past. And right now, it's also -- as we mentioned, probably will be the most balanced global direct company. That's a direction. What exactly proportion of this, it's much more difficult question to answer because it would be a function of general demand. When you say like, for example, the assurance in Europe is not so much in demand, it's in many ways, subject to the type of work, number one and the cost pressure, number two. As soon as the market will start to come back to kind of fix the technical debt which we're talking about, that modernization cloud and data program will accelerate to again, make the progress of GenAI transformation much more real. The demand will come back for practically any region. And because of complexity and creativity of these type of engagements proximity will become much more important and pricing component will become less important. So it would influence the structure as well. So again, number one, we will be much more diversified in India and LatAm, it will be a bit the proportion of the total but exactly proportion, we identify it right now.
Surinder Thind: That's helpful. And then related to that, when you think about all of the new talent that you're hiring, how do you differentiate or attract that talent in the sense that others obviously have large delivery operations out of India. They have well-established connections to the local universities, whereas I would argue you're newer to that region. I realize you've been there since 2015 but just on a relative basis.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So if we're talking about India specifically, I think a couple of factors need to be acknowledged. We have an image of different type of services company, we have an image of much more quality engineering companies and much more closer to what people would think about software tech companies. And from some talent point of view, we compete with these type of companies, the same like with some captives which are trying to build a high-end tech purchases in India. So the image is there already. So at the same time, we are also kind of an underdog in India which means that we have opportunity to play differently and in specific parts of the market, including like bringing our training capabilities and different type of work. I think while there are very large companies, it's -- for us, it's relatively clear how to differentiate us for the labor market, for the type of market. And if you say that we're growing much, much -- like how -- you see it like how India is growing pretty strongly in this situation.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Grossman [ph].
Unidentified Analyst: Just quick -- a couple of quick follow-ups. If I recall, you said the headwind from India, the mix shift in India was going to be about 200 basis points this year on revenue. Is that still a fair assumption? And do you have any initial thoughts on whether -- or the magnitude of the headwinds would be in 2025?
Jason Peterson: Yes. I would say that 2% is generally correct. It probably has gone up slightly from when we guided at the end of the Q1 call. And then I would say for next year, my guess is the headwind from India might be greater than 2%. So I guess that's how I'd respond to that, David.
Unidentified Analyst: And that's just because of the ramp of headcount? Is that why it's higher in '25?
Jason Peterson: Yes, it's probably a little bit higher in billable India and a little bit lower in billable on site. And those 2 things are kind of producing what is probably a modest -- modestly lower average bill rate for the company.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And similarly, I know you've talked quite a bit about the lost clients, I think one was M&A and one was something else. And I'm just trying to remember whether you quantified that headwind this year and next and when we come out against that headwind?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So the one that is kind of the M&A like exit which is the one I usually refer to, I think we called out at the end of the year. And then it was double-digit revenue, like it was over $10 million a quarter. So it was a significant number. And then the other one is the one that has been sort of slowly reducing their demand for our services and that continues to be an ongoing trend. And that was a little bit related to their hesitation around our Ukrainian footprint. And then I think they're also just doing a little bit of work around bringing some positions in-house. But we still, again, have demand from them but just there's been a gradual decline over time. And I think you'll continue to see that for the next couple of quarters.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And just one last thing. Just on the DSO, Jason, I know it was up last quarter and it was up again sequentially. Should we see that or do that as maybe a macro dynamic that's affecting all your accounts? Or is this another way of providing better terms to remain more competitive? Or is there something else going on?
Jason Peterson: Yes. I would say that on the 76 was definitely a result of just the last couple of days being on a weekend and so we saw a significant amount of cash coming on the Monday and Tuesday but that was here in Q3. But David, I would say that as we've moved towards more fixed fee, that is having an impact on DSO, because it does kind of impact the invoicing. And I do think that you're likely to see something closer to 74 for the second half of the year. And again, that's due to the shifting in the type of contracting we've been doing. So then I guess with that, maybe we're...
Mike Rowshandel: Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: The final question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna.
James Friedman: So with regard to your last answer, Jason, that was really interesting about the fixed price to DSO. I'm just wondering also just related to that, is fixed -- is the growth in fixed price related to generative AI or outcomes-based pricing? That's my first one. And then my second one, I'll just ask it upfront, is Ark, could you call out what's going on in life science? I know Jason mentioned it's a combination of both healthcare and life sciences in his prepared remarks. It was a featured topic at the Analyst Day a couple of years ago. It seems like it's working now. So any high-level stuff, first, on fixed price; and second, on life science?
Jason Peterson: Fix fees, certainly, there's, I would say, some experimentation with sort of fixed fee with productivity that's GenAI driven. I don't think that's showing up in the numbers right now but it may continue to sort of show up in increased fixed fee. I would say more so, again, clients are looking for us to step in and say, we can deliver a certain program for a fixed amount of money or we can deliver a certain amount of story points for a fixed amount on a monthly basis. And again, it is -- it allows us to be a little bit more competitive. And then we are doing a little bit more business in the Middle East and that market tends to be more fixed fee oriented as well. And so those would be the two things on that. And then growth in life sciences & healthcare, Ark?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. I think we were talking about it. We were talking about building more industry expertise in this area. And in general, from our conversation several years back, it was positive growth, while it was a couple of things when client situation was actually changed. Right now, it's pretty positive. I think concentration of data programs in our life sciences & healthcare business is actually very high which is still in demand today. And again, combination of industry expertise which we invested in some level of consultancy and again data program proportion makes this a benefit for us. And that's with how we look into some other industries, how we can change the trend similar to what is happening here. I think time is over. And as usual, thank you for joining us today. So I think we're trying to communicate that while situation as it is right now, we do believe that EPAM is all focused on cloud data engineering and with GenAI, pretty well positioned for the future growth when markets come back. So I know we repeated this each time but it's actually -- we very much believe it. And we will be ready for a comeback and anticipation. We'll see how many quarters we will have to still wait for this. But again, thank you and let's talk in 3 months.
Operator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now all disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-09 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Eric, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2024 EPAM Systems Earnings Conference Call.
 [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
David Straube: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter 2024 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer.
 I'd like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website.
 With that said, I'd like to now turn the call over to Ark. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. First, about our guidance change. As you saw from our press release, we are seeing some continuing volatility in our global demand environment. And while there are encouraging signs of new deals in new types of very different domain-specific demands, then even in cyclical nature of 2023 follow as well in 2024, which now leads us to adjust our thinking for both Q2 and for all -- full year outlook.
 As I mentioned during our fourth quarter earnings call, our initial view was the 2024 environment will be, at least for the first half of the year, a continuation of second part of 2023's trends with a potential demand upturn right after, and that would take us into sequential growth for 2024. This view, which we now believe was optimistic, was supported by broadly anticipated more positive macro assumptions and our active interactions with the clients during the very end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024.
 That was directing our belief that clients will more quickly come back to growth in re-prioritization for the remainder of 2024. We also believe that once we enter into Q2, we would have much more measurable indicators for the improvements of the demand environment for digital engineering, data, cloud and AI and from which we can build further out 2024 revenue scenarios and plans.
 What we now understand is that the macroeconomic and geopolitical factors that continue to drive volatility in overall markets and specifically in the IT services and digital transformation sectors are still with us throughout the reminder of the year. While the programs we anticipated to start by now are still in place, and some are in active discussions, many of them have been postponed to future periods or decided to be implemented in much more modest scopes.
 In addition, we need for -- rebalancing our delivery platform to lower cost locations forced some level of slowdown in our revenue growth, too. And so our expectation for considerably high level of accelerated revenue trends in second part of the year will not be materializing as we anticipated, at least as we see it now.
 Jason will provide more details in our updated outlook for 2024 but let me share some current highlights of our business from Q1 up to today. Throughout the last quarter, and continuing into now, we've been making progress across all critically important areas for us, which were discussed in depth during our previous call. We are strengthening and repositioning our Italian delivery platform as well as the cost effectiveness of our offerings by rebalancing our Italian distribution from more expensive locations to less expensive ones while maintaining our commitment to our traditionally strong [ years. ]
 India, our second-largest delivery location is growing rapidly, not only in terms of headcount, but also by creating new capability centers in data, cloud, digital transformation and AI-enabled managed services. We recently opened our Gurugram office and plan to open additional locations to support our client growing needs.
 LATAM is another of our stated priorities in overall rebalancing. As we refine and expand our locations there, we're expanding our key engineering genAI capabilities and division. In the first quarter, we announced the acquisition of Vates, a multi award-winning software development company with offices in Argentina and Chile. We are continuously investing in our existing and new technical capabilities including, crucial for the future, genAI, data and ML and predictive AI and in corresponding IP development. We also continued to improve our domain industry capabilities in consulting and advisory services.
 During the beginning of 2024, we have seen encouraging signs of more balanced demand environment across our business with both new and existing logos, equally weighted between cost takeout and business change and modernization. This portfolio-wide perspective, combined with our efforts to establish domain-specific and relevant approaches for go-to-market, both independently and with our partners, leads us to believe that our ongoing reinvestment in consulting experience, cloud data, AI and vertical-led solutions will provide the unique edge we need to secure a long-term growth.
 Couple of short stories to illustrate the above. EPAM recently teamed up with AWS health and a leading energy company in the U.K. to transform its customer experience, responding to a market that is characterized by the need for enhanced customer expectations, emerging competitors, regulatory demands, smart metering adoption and sustainability growth. Our engagement was built around key transformations of payment channels, customer service frameworks and shift to agile processes to ensure service flexibility.
 For a new logo, one of the world's best known global car rental brands, we are helping to redesign a critical data platform that will enhance intelligent real-time pricing capabilities and drive better experiences for customers and further increasing their price and market leadership. We believe it is the next iteration of platform engineering into a truly intelligent application empowered by AI that will drive the future of our demand.
 Finally, and another encouraging sign, our long-term clients are also returning to us with newer streams related to modernization and next-gen support, which now include much expanded engagement footprint with largest shares of India and Latin America, including net new delivery locations in Argentina and Brazil.
 In general, our focus on domain-led propositions is the reason we believe we saw much stronger growth in some verticals this past quarter. For example, in our healthcare and life science portfolio, we are part of a number of strategic programs helping clients in areas of cloud, data platform, physical digital product development and engineering as well as new genAI-driven initiatives.
 On another side, in some of our verticals, namely business information and media, we continue to work through the impact of ramp-downs from a few large clients initiated previously. And while we aren't able yet to offset this with revenue coming from new opportunities, we are still seeing a more balanced picture emerging over the course of the next quarters.
 Across all our verticals and geos, we are seeing more interest and higher level of program starts related to generative AI. In Q1, a number of our key clients formerly selected EPAM as strategic partners for their AI transformation journeys, where EPAM will help to scale AI, including genAI to unlock the power of data and to establish valuable insights. These engagements are often starting today from advisory and from the use of our differentiating IP and then ramping up to specific use cases. We believe that will lead us to a new level of engagement with our buyers by allowing to drive meaningful business breakthroughs with our tools and in combination with our consulting and scaled delivery capabilities. And while the revenue impact of these programs is still limited today, we see it's a very visible progression of the AI-enabled services market for us.
 To summarize, while in Q1, across our core business, we are seeing a more balanced demand outlook than in the most part of 2023, and a gradual return to modernization and business change programs as well as ramping up genAI-related opportunities. As mentioned already today, by the end of Q1, we realized that the speed and scale of those changes were not in line with our earlier expectations.
 Moving to how we managing our business in this part of the cycle. As we focus on driving new demand and proactively converting and expanding our wallet share with clients, we're also looking for opportunities to drive efficiency and focus throughout the organization. We have shared our ongoing efforts to rebalance the business from a geographical perspective over the course of last year, and that program is ongoing.
 Our attention now is tilting towards a more finely-tuned approach to both geographic investment as well as our areas of capability and market, particularly around our stated market segments, AI cloud, data, experience and domain-led consulting.
 We've gone to market in much more intentional way with key propositions and strategic partners and are now looking to refine some of those propositions and investment as we look to balance near-term and long-term demand with our investments. Throughout the remainder of this year, we will be focusing on driving enhanced efficiency and further rebalancing of our geographical footprint, resizing portions of our in-market and some other teams, enhancing operational efficiencies and engineering productivity through application of AI and automation internally at EPAM and driving a singular focus on client centricity for the entire company.
 Those continual efforts are critically important as we navigate the current environment while taking the necessary steps for the eventual return for build and transform programs, which have been slowed down during the last 2 years.
 Our fundamentals are strong, and we are fully confident that EPAM will be in a lead position in this rebound, enabled by our significantly diversified global delivery platform and driven by long-term precious legacy modernization, needs for advanced customer-centric solutions and the significant interest in applying and integrating genAI and genAI capabilities into new and existing enterprise platforms, innovative intelligent applications and new transformative business models.
 With that, let me pass to Jason to provide details on our Q1 results and our guidance for 2024. 
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, EPAM generated revenue of $1.165 billion, a year-over-year decrease of 3.8% on a reported basis or 4.3% in constant currency terms, reflecting a favorable foreign exchange impact of 50 basis points. Due to our exit from the Russian market, we will longer generate revenue from Russian clients. The impact of this exit had an approximate 50 basis point negative impact on year-over-year revenue growth. Excluding Russia revenues, year-over-year revenue for reported and constant currency would have decreased by 3.3% and 3.8%, respectively.
 Moving to our vertical performance. Life sciences and healthcare delivered very strong year-over-year growth of 26%. Growth in the quarter was driven by clients in both life sciences and healthcare. To reflect a more diverse end market, our travel and consumer vertical has been renamed consumer goods, retail and travel. On a year-over-year basis, the vertical decreased 6.9%, largely due to declines in retail, partially offset by solid growth in travel. Sequentially, the vertical grew modestly driven by solid sequential growth in the travel portion of the portfolio.
 Software and hi-tech contracted 8.3% year-over-year and grew 2.6% on a sequential basis, suggesting some level of stability in the vertical. Financial services decreased 10.3% year-over-year, driven by declines in banking, asset management and the payment sector.
 Business information and media declined 15.8% compared to Q1 in 2023. Revenue in the quarter was substantially impacted by the previously discussed ramp down of a top-20 client. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered solid year-over-year growth of 12.9%, driven by clients in energy and telecom.
 From a geographic perspective, Americas, our largest region, representing 59% of our Q1 revenues, declined 2.4% year-over-year on a reported and constant currency basis. Sequentially, growth was 2.4%, reflecting ongoing signs of stabilization in the geography. EMEA representing 39% of our Q1 revenues contracted 3.2% year-over-year and 4.8% in constant currency. And finally, APAC declined 13.1% year-over-year or 11.5% in constant currency terms and now represents 2% of our revenues. Revenue in the quarter was impacted primarily by the ramp-down of work within our financial services vertical.
 In Q1, revenues from our top-20 clients declined 8.6% year-over-year while revenues from clients outside our top 20 declined 1%. The relatively stronger performance of this latter group was driven by both new logo revenue and inorganic revenue contributions.
 Moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 28.4% compared to 29.3% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 30.4% compared to 31.5% for the same quarter last year. Gross margin in Q1 2024 was negatively impacted by foreign exchange due to strengthening of currencies in certain of our delivery locations. Additionally, the inability to adjust prices after EPAM's Q2 2023 promotion campaign continues to have a negative impact on profitability.
 GAAP SG&A was 17% of revenue compared to 17.5% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A in Q1 2024 came in at 14.1% of revenue compared to 15.3% in the same period last year. SG&A improvement in the quarter is a result of our ongoing focus on managing our cost base and increasing efficiency in our spend. GAAP income from operations was $111 million or 9.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to $120 million or 9.9% of revenue in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $174 million or 14.9% of revenue in the quarter compared to $178 million or 14.7% of revenue in Q1 of last year.
 Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 6%, which included a higher level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.4%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.97. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.46 compared to $2.47 in Q1 of last year, reflecting a $0.01 decrease year-over-year. In Q1, there were approximately 58.9 million diluted shares outstanding.
 Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q1 was $130 million compared to $87 million in the same quarter of 2023. Cash flow from operations in the quarter reflected a lower level of variable compensation payout related to 2023. Free cash flow was $123 million compared to free cash flow of $79 million in the same quarter last year. At the end of Q1, DSO was 73 days and compares to 71 days for Q4 2023 and 69 days for the same quarter last year. The uptick in DSO reflects an increase in the time some clients are taking in the review and approval of payments.
 Share repurchases in the first quarter were approximately 396,000 shares for $121 million at an average price of $304.21 per share. As of March 31, we had approximately $214 million of share repurchase authority remaining. We ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents.
 Moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended Q1 with more than 47,050 consultants, designers, engineers and architects, a decline of 8% compared to Q1 2023. This is the result of lower levels of hiring, combined with both voluntary and involuntary attrition as we continue to balance supply and demand. Our total headcount for the quarter was more than 52,800 employees. Utilization was 76.8% compared to 74.9% in Q1 of last year, and 74.4% in Q4 2023.
 Now let's turn to our business outlook. We are continuing to see a modest improvement in demand. However, client decision-making continues to be cautious, and demand is not improving to the degree expected when we set our original 2024 guidance. At that time, based on the modest sequential growth achieved in Q4 2023 and our forecast of modest growth in Q1, we expected Q2 to show flat to modest sequential improvement, followed by solid sequential growth averaging at least 3% for Q3 and Q4. As a reminder, based on the sequential declines in 2023 quarterly revenue, we needed to generate regular sequential growth in 2024 to produce year-over-year growth.
 For the remainder of the year, with limited demand improvement, we now expect seasonal factors to have a more pronounced impact on sequential revenue growth with Q2 showing a modest decline, Q3 improving followed by flat to a possible modest decline in revenues in Q4. Additionally, although we are seeing some modest incremental contribution to revenue from recently completed acquisitions, that contribution is largely offset by foreign exchange headwinds, resulting from the ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar. We're maintaining our focus on demand generation and will continue to prioritize revenue growth throughout 2024.
 In 2024, we will incur incremental costs related to compensation. Additionally, lower utilization for EPAM's in-market resources and some ongoing pricing pressure will continue to negatively impact gross margins. However, we are committed to running the business at a profitability level of at least 15% for non-GAAP adjusted IFO. We are planning to initiate additional cost savings measures to ensure that we can achieve our profit objectives while still focusing on long-term growth.
 Finally, our operations in Ukraine continue to run at high levels of utilization, a testament to our team's dedication and focus on maintaining uninterrupted quality of delivery. Our guidance assumes that we will continue to be able to deliver from our Ukraine delivery centers at productivity levels similar to levels achieved in 2023.
 Moving to our full-year outlook. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $4.575 billion to $4.675 billion, a negative growth rate of 1.4% at the midpoint of the range. The impact of foreign exchange on growth is now expected to have a negative impact of approximately 30 basis points. At this time, we expect approximately 1% of revenue contribution from already completed acquisitions. We expect GAAP income from operations will now be in the range of 10% to 10.5% and non-GAAP income from operations will now be in the range of 15% to 15.5%.
 We expect our GAAP effective tax rate will now be 20%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, will continue to be 24%. Earnings per share, we expect the GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.34 to $7.64 for the full year, and we are focused on maintaining non-GAAP diluted EPS so as to remain in the range of $10 to $10.30 for the full year. We now expect weighted average share count of 58.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
 Moving to our Q2 2024 outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.135 billion to $1.145 billion, producing a year-over-year decline of 2.6% at the midpoint of the range with the expected impact of foreign exchange to be negative 0.6%. For the second quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 9% to 10% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%. We expect GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 25% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24%.
 For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.52 to $1.60 for the quarter, and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.21 to $2.29 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 58.8 million diluted shares outstanding.
 Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for the remainder of the year. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $38 million for Q2, $46 million for Q3 and $47 million for Q4. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $6 million for each of the remaining quarters. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be a $1 million loss for each of the remaining quarters. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $10 million for Q2 and $11 million for each of the remaining quarters. We expect excess tax benefits to be around $1 million for Q2 and $1.7 million for each of the remaining quarters.
 We expect incremental restructuring charges in the second half of 2024 and at this time, cannot estimate the amounts with reasonable certainty. We expect to provide detailed estimates during our Q2 call. Incremental restructuring charges are currently not included in our guidance. However, these charges will not impact our non-GAAP results.
 Finally, one more assumption outside of our GAAP to non-GAAP items. With our significant cash position, we are generating a healthy level of interest income and are now expecting interest and other income to be approximately $15 million for Q2, $20 million for Q3 and $15 million for Q4. While we work our way through the cycle of lower demand, we will continue to run EPAM efficiently, positioning the company to capitalize on a more normalized demand environment.
 Lastly, my continued thanks to all of our employees for their dedication and focus on serving our clients and driving results for EPAM.
 Operator, let's open the call up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. 
Bryan Bergin: Wanted to start with some more detail on the change in the growth outlook here and ultimately trying to unpack attribution here to macro market-driven slowness versus more idiosyncratic factors to your turnaround and your exposure. Can you talk about whether this is really broad-based across the portfolio or more so due to a handful of larger client-specific slowdowns? And is there any attribution to a change in clients' reception to Ukraine or Belarus delivery? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you. I think in our opening remarks, we -- exactly reflecting what was happening from our standpoint. I think, based on the Q4 level of optimism, I would say, and beginning of Q1, we were trying to predict how potential growth for would look like versus conversations and [ standard ] opportunities.
 So in the second part of Q1, at the same time, we realized that many programs were delayed and some of them were started, but at very different level of the scope. And that was -- put us in a position to not try to predict the future market and economic trends and other things but actually focus on what we see right now and with all this volatility, put our guidance in more realistic scenario based on what we really know.
 So there is nothing happening kind of -- but we're not losing clients. We're not having some unexpected problems. So there are some more specific trends when we're increasing India share of our delivery. So there are foreign exchange, there are locations and billable hours availability in Q2, and that's -- I can pass to Jason to -- more details. 
Jason Peterson: Yes, Bryan, the -- I think what Ark said is that we're -- at this point rather than trying to predict that there's going to be an improvement in demand, we're just taking kind of what we see today, which is still client decision-making is slow, budgets are being partially released, some programs are being descoped. And so we're just not seeing quite improvement that obviously, we had hoped for. So obviously, it was a miss on our part.
 The one thing that Ark referenced, which we've talked about over the last couple of quarters, but we've now been able to do some more analysis on it is we still see strong sufficient demand for Ukraine, Poland, locations like that. So utilization is still very good in Ukraine, for instance. However, we are seeing more pronounced growth in India.
 And so what -- in the calculations that we've done over the last couple of weeks, what we're seeing is that an ongoing mix shift towards India, particularly for new engagements is beginning to produce a bit of a headwind in terms of our revenue growth rate measured in dollars. And so that is beginning to show up in terms of a sequential impact and a somewhat larger impact for the full year. Some of that was anticipated when we did the guidance, but my guess is probably not fully. 
Bryan Bergin: Okay. Okay. That's very good detail. I appreciate that. My follow-up here is partly on that. So as you're refining the global operations and rebalancing the delivery platform, if I heard correctly, it sounds like the structure became a bit too distributed across countries, and you're trying to rein that in. Can you just add more color on what -- how long this may ultimately take?
 And then, Jason, just on that last point, are you able to quantify how much the shift to the lower-cost locations weighs on this year's growth? 
Jason Peterson: Yes. So -- and again, it's a calculation, if we -- think of a constant currency calculation, where we go if the mix were the same as in 2023. In 2024, what would the impact be? Again, I do want to confirm that we still have demand for Central Europe and Eastern Europe, but again, a lot of the incremental demand due to client sensitivity is coming into India. It could be something approaching $100 million if you did a constant currency impact on a year-over-year basis.
 India continues to -- I'm just going to step ahead to the obvious next questions, how profitable is India? Is that a drag on profitability? The cost structure is lower in India. The bill rates are lower in India, but the profitability in India is still very solid. So it's not dragging down profitability by any means. But what it is doing is beginning to produce some headwinds against revenue growth. Some of that, again, would have been anticipated in our traditional guidance or our guidance that we provided at the beginning of the year. My guess is it wasn't fully anticipated. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jonathan Lee with Guggenheim Securities. 
Yu Lee: Given the way you positioned the demand environment in your prepared remarks, what, in your customer conversation, gives you confidence that you're able to achieve sequential growth in 3Q and potentially flat 4Q? And is the 3Q dynamic more of a function of bill days? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: You're talking about sequential growth in Q3? 
Jason Peterson: Yes, Jonathan. So just to -- the question about whether or not we see sequential growth in Q3. The way we have laid out the guidance, okay, really is the seasonal factors are going to drive. And so the Q2 to Q3 growth would substantially be driven by seasonality, which is more available bill days in Q3. 
Yu Lee: And just a follow-up, I want to build on Bryan's earlier question. You've -- you're seeing your India expansion actually take place. And are you comfortable with the level of delivery, quality, harmonization that you're seeing there, given you've highlighted that in the past? And how much more work needs to happen there? 
Jason Peterson: I think we feel quite good about the quality of our India delivery, and we think it's differentiated, okay, our India versus, let's say, our peers or competitors' India. We still feel very good about the quality of our Eastern European delivery. And we clearly have a number of clients who still prefer Eastern Europe, but we feel good about the work that we've done in India to differentiate. And again, we've got good ability to continue to scale the geography, and we have relatively low levels of attrition. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Maggie Nolan with William Blair. 
Margaret Nolan: I understand the commentary about the rate cards in India and how that's impacting your top line, but it also sounded like there were some delays, some pushouts of projects. It didn't sound like much in the way of cancellations, which is encouraging. But I'm trying to understand were there particular types of projects, particular verticals in that vein that drove your change in expectations? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think it's broad -- there is no specific on verticals. We actually highlighted that there are some vertical, which impacted by decisions which were done practically in previous period. There are some verticals which operate better, like we highlighted healthcare, life sciences as well. Energy for example, in the same bucket.
 So -- but in general, it's pretty broad, cautions, and again, a number of programs, which we were -- expected to jump start in Q2, delayed or again, were put down kind of in the scope of implementation. But conversation happening, there is no cancellations, but rather definitely delays and slowness in decisions. 
Jason Peterson: And the feedback that we're getting is that certain clients, although they appear to have budget are sort of slow to begin to activate the budget. And I would say probably if we were to talk to a specific portion of the portfolio, we have feared that at some point, we may see more caution in Europe, and I think that's where we're seeing kind of a relative change in the business.
 In North America, it does feel like it's stabilized, and we did see sequential growth as we talked about in our prepared remarks. But we're beginning to see some incremental weakness in our European... 
Margaret Nolan: Okay. And then you've obviously made some changes in terms of pricing, in terms of delivery. You've been putting extra attention on some of your largest, longest-duration clients. So is there any notable change in client retention or win rates? Are those progressing differently than they were roughly a year ago when you announced some of the changes that you intended to make? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we just kind of repeat the [indiscernible]. In general, there is no any kind of dramatic changes. Mostly, it's attributed to delayed decisions and very specific things like if we're talking about Q2, which we have already shared. Billable hours, it's FX, it's multiple parameters, which is calculated one. So the rest of this is in line with what we were seeing before. But again, decisions slow down, and now we try to project exactly what we see versus what we kind of thinking might happen. 
Jason Peterson: Yes, clearly no longer have the confidence of sequential demand improvement in the second half than we had when we released the guidance. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. 
Surinder Thind: Is there any color that you can provide on intra-quarter trends in 1Q in the sense of how the quarter started? And then at what point did you kind of start to see clients begin to push off projects? Just any color there would be helpful. 
Jason Peterson: Yes. Maybe what I'll do is unpack, I guess, is the word I'll use, what happened in Q1. So we entered Q1 with the guide that we had, and we expected that we probably could get to the top or maybe a little bit above the high end of the range and had come in with a range that we wanted to make sure that we could make.
 What we saw during the quarter is that things were a little bit slower than expected, and we did get some benefit from foreign exchange, which I would size at about $2 million and just a modest amount of M&A contribution that was not in our original guide, and that would be about $800,000. To be adjusted for those two factors, we're pretty much closer to the middle point of the range, pretty much at consensus rather than this revenue beat.
 So things were a little bit slower than we expected in Q1, not much, but somewhat. We have been able to calculate that this India shift even showed up in sort of sequential impact. And as Ark said, at this point, we're just not willing to continue to guide with an assumption that we're going to see improving demand. And we -- but we are seeing stability in the portfolio and probably feel a little bit of improvement if you adjust for the shift towards India. 
Surinder Thind: And then in terms of just understanding trends within the top-20 clients versus those outside the top 20. You called out a pretty material difference in the growth rates. Part of that, I believe you attributed to just the acquisition, but also others to new logo activity. Just any color on how much new logos are contributing to the growth at this point and just where things are within the cycle there? 
Jason Peterson: Yes. And so let me talk about the top 20. So the top 20 does have a significant number of business information and media clients in it. That is a more challenged portion of the portfolio, I would say, due to their end markets, in addition to the client that we talked about over the last couple of quarters that had ramped down in Q1 and again in Q2 as they kind of exit. We -- and again, this is all known, and we've talked about -- okay? But we are seeing some reduction in spend in another business information and media client in Europe, and that is the top 20-client. So those things kind of show up. 
 And then from a new logo standpoint, part of what's going on in North America is, again, stability in the existing client portion of the portfolio, but we are beginning to see growth in North America in terms of new logo revenues. And then Europe, there's an awful lot of activity, but generally, it's kind of smaller in size from a contribution standpoint. Again, encouraging but obviously not enough to drive the type of growth rate that we had originally expected. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. 
Jason Kupferberg: I wanted to just stay on the India topic for a minute and talk about competition there. Obviously, it's pretty crowded. Just in terms of the vendor landscape and on a relative basis, EPAM is somewhat more of a newcomer. So curious to see how you see the competitive landscape there versus your more traditional service delivery geographies?
 And then just if we look at headcount mix, I think at the end of last year, Ukraine was still #1 at 19%, India was 15%. I mean, do you think in the not-too-distant future, India could potentially become your largest country? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we're very satisfied with our progress in India. So -- and by the end of the year, we might be closer to 20% of the total headcount. So it's still going to be the largest -- fastest growing. And probably we'll be on par with Ukraine or maybe larger than Ukraine.
 So from the quality perspective, we talked about it in the past many times. We invested there firmly, and we're doing this for a long time and India become fastest growing location. I think even in 2021 or maybe even in 2019, I don't remember it now, but it was one of the fastest one like before market went down.
 So -- and we're also trying to build, and we mentioned today -- like not trying to build. We built significant data practice or built significant digital engagement practice. So we put in all necessary things there to build genAI practice as well. So it's a location, which [ embodies ] all what we see in EPAM traditionally. And that's a differentiation as well because we don't try to duplicate just kind of scale, but exactly the quality which we [ growing ].
 So there is different type of competition. At the same time, we also mentioned that our competition for talents there is mostly captive and technology companies, and that continues to be for us as well. So I think, in general, very positive experience, and we think it will play bigger and more important role. While we are very committed to our kind of talent, which we built over the years in Europe and -- yes. As we said before, we probably will be the most kind of diverse from the talent perspective company in our sector. 
Jason Peterson: The only thing I'll add to that, similar to what we do in Eastern Europe, we don't seek to be the lowest cost provider in any market in which we operate. Again, we -- differentiated quality in India, and we charge a premium relative to other peers' kind of India rates based on what we believe is a differentiated offering there. 
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. And I think in response to an earlier question, you said that your win rate on new logos is intact, which is good to hear. I'm just curious whether you've seen any material change in your wallet share within, say, your top-20 existing clients? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Like again, there are several clients, which we mentioned already. So -- but in general, I think it's very good, at least from wallet-share point of view. We have visible increase in some of the clients. We have pretty good stability and then saying again, there are some companies, which we mentioned before, which make like long-term decision. And we've seen actually visible slowdown in the execution kind of like when decrease [ capacity ] with us and there are a couple which turned back and starting to growing with us. So I think we're pretty comfortable with what we do in this -- our top 20. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. 
Moshe Katri: So the pipeline is there. It's just not converting at the pace that you guys expected it to be, and you have some deferrals out there. The question here is, and obviously, the environment is pretty fluid, how quickly can these be switched around? Let's say, the Fed cut rates and let's say, the macro volatility kind of maybe is improving. How quickly can these programs get back on board? Just -- again, just what I'm hearing -- is just that the demand environment is pretty fluid and obviously, things can turn on and off pretty quickly. How would you see that? How would you characterize this one? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: That's exactly what we say -- we said already, we don't want to predict anymore. So we try to be more kind of pragmatic in this situation. Historically, whether or not -- volatility can change, and demand could be very fast. I'm not sure that it will be very fast in this current environment. But I only can repeat what we were saying before that the whole point for us starting from all this thing during the last couple of years to prepare ourselves well when environment will change.
 And that's why we very carefully kind of managing all our capabilities necessary for this restart if needed. And I think that's why, in general, we feel very comfortable. The fundamentals then that we're actually becoming a better company from diversification of our risks, from our delivery kind of capabilities and again, the real change will happen when demand will change. And again, that could happen relatively fast, but let's see. I don't have any more opinion right now. 
Moshe Katri: Okay. That's fair. And then just a follow-up. Last quarter, you spoke about some clients that were coming back to EPAM. Originally, EPAM clients, when they expanded scope, they went somewhere else, and they came back. Are you continuing to see the same trend throughout this quarter? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. This is happening, and this is happening not necessarily just when clients come back. It's also happening when clients were going down and now become comfortable with our kind of [ diversification ] of delivery and starting to come back to us. It's again, it's not huge things, but it's a very positive message. 
 And another thing that developments, vision to some new locations where we open as well, and that's again exactly not necessarily optically visible for proportional revenue growth because we're doing more work in India. And I think that's exactly what we were plan to do to make sure that we stabilize and that we're protecting our market share and clients. But exactly to your question, yes, it is continuously happening. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Could you provide some additional color on margins and the margin cadence as we progress through the year? And if you could help us with that, that would be appreciated. 
Jason Peterson: Yes. So in Q2, we've got the lower bill days as we talked about, and that usually does have a depressive effect on margins, and so right now for Q2, I am expecting that we could be at 30% gross margin, or slightly below that, on a non-GAAP basis. I think for the first half of 2024, you'll see gross margins around 32%. And then the second half, I think you'd see margins in the 32% to 33% range, and that would kind of blend us into this sort of 31% to 32%.
 So again, you'll see somewhat improving margins as we continue to focus on our costs, and at the same time, you get a little bit of benefit from the stronger bill days in the second half. 
Ramsey El-Assal: And a quick follow-up. A lot of your peers who are also calling out big demand headwinds right now, they view these headwinds in terms of sort of discretionary headwinds versus nondiscretionary spend. Do you have a view of your own portfolio in that context? What percentage of your portfolio is sort of discretionary? 
Jason Peterson: Yes. I guess it all depends on how you define that. We've never have -- as I think we all know, we had a large portfolio of multiyear maintenance, multiyear BPO or that type of thing. So a lot of our work generally is kind of newer build, digital. And as we talked about, the modernization programs, which we still believe are generally intact but are slow to ramp, in some cases, as Ark indicated, is that people have kind of descoped some of those programs. So we still think that demand is in the future. But arguably, when it comes to discretion, you can certainly delay those programs and expenditures. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Potter with Citigroup. 
Ryan Potter: I wanted to start on pricing. Have you seen any changes to the pricing environment since last earnings? And are you still offering some discounting to when business in certain areas like you were in the past? Just trying to figure out if you're finding a greater presence from certainly lower cost locations like India that's leading maybe to some client pushback on current arrangements or if the pricing pressure is more on net new engagements? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we believe the pricing environment did not improve. So -- as the only improvement could happen if demand will go up. So -- and with the current status quo, I think pricing environment is pretty tough and challenging continuously in India. 
Jason Peterson: So it's not incrementally worse, but it continues to be challenging. It's one of the reasons why there is kind of a bias towards India at the lower bill rates. And the market is -- yes, with, what I would call kind of an imbalance in supply and demand, it continues to be a less-friendly market when it comes to trying to get rate increases for certain. 
Ryan Potter: Got it. And a follow-up, I guess, on your investment level and kind of net hiring. Now that you're seeing more of a challenging demand environment, will you look to dial back some of the growth investments you were trying to do when you started the year or re-prioritize those?
 And then from a headcount perspective, are you expecting the headcount to decrease further sequentially off these levels? Are you likely to kind of maintain the bench you have to meet demand as it returns? 
Jason Peterson: I think you'll see us continue to invest in India as we've talked on this call. I think you'll see us continue to increase our position in Latin America. I do think, and I implied this, or I think maybe even stated it in our prepared remarks, is that with this kind of budget caution with clients, we are seeing less demand for in-market resources. That continues to be a place where we do have more bench than we would like. So that's a bit of a challenge for us.
 And again, I think what you'll see us do, at least for the coming couple of quarters is to continue to invest more in, again, India and Latin America. We still think that there's a demand environment in our future for Central and Eastern Europe and also for that market. But today, it certainly continues to be a challenging environment, particularly for the higher cost in market resources. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna. 
James Friedman: Jason, in your prepared remarks, you called out some of the trends in billing and on the DSO. I remember when you first started there, that was a big conversation. You improved that immeasurably. I'm just wondering is what's going on in the DSO? Is this something that we need to watch for like billability and collections? 
Jason Peterson: Yes. So we're really focused on managing that. And again, very careful to make certain that, obviously, our revenue recognition is appropriate and also that we're trying to avoid any potential kind of write-off of AR. So I'm not concerned about that.
 What we are seeing clients are taking more time to review and make payments and that type of thing. And I assume it's just based on the environment. And so we are trying to manage it, but I suspect that DSO is going to remain above 70 for the remainder of the year. Again, I don't have concerns about it either in terms of revenue recognition or potential write-offs, okay? But yes, I wish we could maintain at 70 or 69 and I think that's a little bit unlikely in today's environment where everyone is kind of managing their cash flow a little bit more carefully. 
James Friedman: Got it. And then is there any way to unpack the revenue because you alluded to this -- you both alluded to this in your prepared remarks, the ramp downs versus the sluggishness in everything else. Like how much is the ramp-down dynamic impacting the revenue commentary and guidance? 
Jason Peterson: Well, so we had this -- the BIM customer that we talked about where a competitor has sort of taken over their IT function. And that obviously had a step down on a year-over-year basis as well as a quarterly -- a sequential impact, Q4 to Q1. There'll be another slightly sequential impact associated with that same client between Q1 and Q2.
 And then we had a large BIM client who is continuing to sort of tighten up their spending. And because they are a large client, if they tighten up their spending, that's certainly reducing the level of revenue that we were generating from them, and it is showing up in our growth rates. I don't know whether I'd call it kind of a ramp down, but certainly, they're reducing the level of headcount that... 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Just to kind of -- there is no any real impact from ramp downs, which kind of new to us. There is a redistribution of delivery, and we talked about it when there is a switch to lower-cost locations. There are new business, which are faster growing there as well, and this is all related again to pricing environment. So -- but, no, ramp downs, right now, not as a real factor. It's more like a normal -- like it's always would happen. It's happening as well, but in a very normal way. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. 
James Faucette: Wanted to ask just in terms of your planning assumptions and kind of given the experiences of the last few quarters, how are you thinking about -- or how are you changing your planning assumptions in terms of pipeline, conversion rates or timing, et cetera, not just in terms of like what you're seeing right now, but are you building in more conservatism from that perspective? And how does that impact your planning from a hiring perspective, et cetera, right now? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: We definitely are learning our lessons, and we put much more pragmatic view because, yes, we were a little bit more optimistic in the past when markets will come back. So right now, we're looking at this very pragmatically with a good level of -- strong level of kind of conservatism. And I don't know what to add. So I think that's actually, exactly what is happening.
 We're looking for the next 90 days, where we can predict it and predict the future based on this. But if by the end of the quarter situation will change, we will start doing this differently. Until, we will say that general conditions is directionally good, more like to one or another direction. 
James Faucette: Great. That makes sense. And then in terms of like from a revenue perspective with the mixing geographic shifts and kind of pricing that your customers are asking for, any sense for how long we should think about that being a revenue headwind? Do you have in your mind like, I guess, a distribution of delivery and when we might hit a stable level there? 
Jason Peterson: Let me comment, and then Ark will probably say something much smarter and more insightful. How I think about it is going to be a trend that we're going to see throughout 2024, but I don't see it as a forever trend. At some point, I think it kind of stabilizes. And I think that we've done a good job of sort of creating a balanced delivery with options or optionality for our clients. And at the same time, I still believe that there's demand for Central and Eastern Europe so far. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: I'll say -- we said before, we do believe that we will be able to put very balanced global delivery capability, as well as from geographical point of view, and equalize as much as possible the quality kind of component of it.
 With this, it's, again, in our segment and our IT services and specifically and kind of subsegment, which we believe we plan, which is more transformational platform build, complex enterprise solutions. Right now, difficult to miss GenAI, and GenAI-enabled solutions, which we consider it a -- playing, and we'll be playing in the future. And this situation, it's an old factor of change in demand when actually our client base will feel that modernization is not just a shift to cloud, but actually changes the applications, changes the platforms to actually benefit from this with maximum.
 And this is very different world to me. As soon as this will be happening, then demand for the talent will be equalized as well. And then it will be growing all over the place. And I think from this point of view, very similar to what Jason just said. I think India will be a very big portion of EPAM, but we will be balanced, and demand will be coming to Central Europe and Eastern Europe and Latin America and it would be all about the quality of delivery and kind of value per dollar versus just dollar per hour. And I think it should happen. Still, we were hoping it would happen in the -- kind of sooner.
 But I think all of us here and vendor side and investor side, I think we all believe that this will turn around because there is no way right now. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arvind Ramnani with Piper Sandler. 
Arvind Ramnani: I just wanted sort of really better understand when you kind of consider guidance, do you look at like -- do you go account by account? Like just trying to get an understanding of kind of the procedure to basically come up with guidance because kind of clearly things have -- are we just in an environment where things that are just so fluid and the velocity of change is something that's difficult to predict? 
Jason Peterson: Yes. And so it's hard to predict kind of moving quarters at this stage. We've talked about the unevenness or the choppiness or the -- in some cases, we've had programs that we have been awarded and then they either haven't started or as Ark talked about, they've been descoped. We have clients who come back to us and said, "We'd like you to do this, but in a lower-cost geography." And again, all those things kind of impact the revenue growth rate.
 So again, there is a significant amount of sort of client level and RFP win estimation and all that, but we're just finding that the demand environment continues not to evolve the way we had originally expected. 
Arvind Ramnani: Okay. That makes sense. And then just with kind of uses of cash as you kind of think about doing additional M&A or basically doing kind of buybacks, or just trying to see -- or is it just one of these things that you'll continue to build? 
Jason Peterson: Arvind, I'm going to be a little short of my response just because we're kind of at the end of the call or past the time. But I would say yes to both. So you will see us continue to do more and more acquisitions that again, are all strategic and do allow us to continue to expand our position, both end markets and in delivery locations. And you will also clearly see us do more buybacks in the coming quarters. 
Operator: And this concludes our Q&A session. I would like to turn the call back over to Arkadiy Dobkin for closing remarks. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: As always, thank you, everybody for joining today. I think we're looking forward for the next call. And I think we're not going to bring surprises next time, at least similar to today. So let's look pragmatically to everything. So fortunately, we didn't have any questions today about genAI and how we're doing there because we're doing pretty good and feel very good about this area, but probably we can spend more time on this topic next time. Thank you very much. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Enjoy the rest of your day. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-15 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. I would like to welcome everyone to the EPAM Systems Q4 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now hand the call over to David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.
David Straube: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President, and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website. With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As usual in Q1, it's time for us to reflect on the past 12 months and share what we think about the next 12. Before I do that, I want to thank our team around the world for their dedication to our clients and hard work throughout last year and for staying committed and engaged in the work ahead of us in 2024. Looking back to 2023, I will start from a short summary very much in line with what we shared in today's press release. We believe that EPAM performance in 2023 reflects our ability to navigate volatile demand growth simultaneously, and simultaneously is the key word here, [indiscernible] by both geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions. After rebalancing most of our delivery talent footprint across Europe, Western and Central Asia, India and Latin America, and refining our go-to-market approach to meet current demand, we are now focused primarily on harmonizing our delivery quality, optimizing cost effectiveness, and proactively leveraging our extensive advanced technology and growing consulting capabilities to capitalize on GenAI and AI-driven opportunities of the future. In that context, first a few notes on 2023 and their relevance to 2024, and then I can move on aspects of our 2024 outlook. Let me start from geopolitical and economic impacts on the EPAM operations. In February of 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine made it necessary for us to relocate over 13,000 people plus families to new geographies. While most of these relocations completed back in 2022, many adjustments did happen last year. And still today in 2024, we will continue to work on some downstream factors, including seniority pyramid, team composition and cost effectiveness across our traditional and new locations. I want to also especially recognize our team in Ukraine who prove that despite the level of challenges, they accepted a reliable partner for our clients, existing and new ones. A few additional notes on repositioning and stabilization of our talent delivery platform. As mentioned already, 2023 was a year of significant rebalancing for most of our global delivery. We work on scaling India and LatAm, and at the same time, preparing for future growth in development centers across Europe and Western and Central Asia, our key destination for majority of our relocated talents. In 2023, India continued to be our fastest-growing location, practically since 2021. And while we were growing our capabilities there with accelerated speed, we also worked to ensure that our delivery culture remains focused on quality and client value. India will likely become our largest location by the end of 2024 or at least on match with our current scale in Ukraine. Latin America, specifically our locations in Colombia and Mexico, have been maturing significantly as we scaled out our cloud and data capabilities there to be prepared to meet rising demand from North American clients. And so, we are starting 2024 from significantly refactored geographic delivery platform, much more balanced than ever to bring together the practices, methods, and collaborative ways of working, and to focus on harmonizing our engineering competencies and critical capabilities in cloud, data, and now in AI, to be present now in each of our strategic locations. In 2024, this is one of our key priorities and we expect these programs to be continuous areas of investment and differentiation for EPAM. As we mentioned in previous calls, there is a growing number of clients who after slowing their spending with us due to the war, have started to grow their engagements with us again by utilizing our much more diverse geographic footprint and advanced delivery capabilities. Supporting this trend will be another key priority, as we continue during 2024 to build up our capabilities both geographically and from our services mix perspective. To illustrate some relevant specific efforts, I will share several ongoing investments in engineering excellence AI learning juniors for all EPAMers covering standard copilots and other AI-assisted engineering productivity tools for all key delivery roles with specific adoption targets being set up for all locations. This tool was released in 2023 with upgrades coming in Q1 and beyond. New upgrades to our digital delivery platform, now being AI enabled and leveraging a set of composable assets that include EPAM proprietary together with open source components and tools to connect to a variety of LLMs for supporting the most critical capabilities, protecting private data, and prompting cost effective and reliable consumption for external LLMs, EPAM DIAL platform. Finally, productivity measurement framework, allowing tailoring of engineering and agile best practices for continuous improvements of individual and team productivity in AI-assisted development environment. All those efforts should make it possible for us to become the most geographically diverse and broadly AI-assisted delivery talent platforms in the industry. Now, about cost effectiveness. It became obvious at the end of 2022, throughout 2023, that to navigate current economic environment, we must continuously consider cost optimization efforts to react properly to all changes around us. Some targeted optimization efforts were ongoing in 2023 across both in market and global delivery locations. This has improved our utilization in the short term and allows us to fund several initiatives in 2023 and 2024. We will be considering similar efforts as appropriate in the future to ensure our adaptability needs. We are also actively working on rebalancing our seniority pyramid by engaging and training junior talent, while improving overall seniority in market and across our key global practices. About AI and GenAI efforts. For years, we have been investing and scaling our data, ML, and predictive AI capabilities. Today, many of our clients are engaging us to do the foundational engineering and data ML work required to help them operate their current businesses, but also to enable them to start their work with generative AI. Since mid of last year, our majority of these are relatively small. We engage in over 400 GenAI-related projects. Our coverage of use cases is broad, from knowledge management to HCM, from product management to supply chain and service optimization, from advanced business process redesign to new interactive agent development, from engineering productivity enhancements by using GenAI tools to improving speed and quality of code generation and testing. Last year, we launched DIAL, our enterprise-level orchestration platform, to accelerate development of GenAI-empowered business solutions. Recently, we released it for open source. We are encouraged by seeing a high level of interest from our clients expressed in over 60 pursuits with 15 active projects in progress right now. And some already in production implementations across the tech, insurance, retail, automotive, life science and business information vertical segments. One of the most interesting deployments was done for major global economic data institutions and one of the most rewarding has been our work in Ukraine on famous Diya, a government platform, which now includes GenAI and AI capabilities as well. Now, let's talk about the demand environment. In 2023, we've managed to safeguard many of our programs and clients' portfolios. We also saw some pullback in spend last year and expect that this may continue to be a factor into 2024 as our clients execute vendor consolidation exercises to manage their costs. While this trend continues, and in some cases to our benefit, we are seeing encouraging signals of a general rebound for build-based solutions and for traditionally strong [indiscernible] capabilities in advanced tech, data experience, consulting, and AI. To capitalize on potential new demand, we are expanding our new business initiative by enhancing our sales strategies and go-to-market partnerships, dedicating resources to create new accelerators, establishing new engagement models and innovating our customer interaction method. In 2023, it was also evident that we brought new clients at a rate higher than in previous years, and we plan to do it again in 2024. Still, in overall, we believe at this point the 2024 environment will be, at least for the first half of the year, a continuation of the second part of 2023 trends, with the potential demand up toward the second half. While we have made significant progress on involving our operations and despite the challenges we have faced in 2023, our work with clients have been increasingly recognized by leading analysts and provide in turn some independent support for the stories we shared. All the reports are very recent, last two, three months and present the up-to-date views on EPAM. About some new capabilities. In November 2023, EPAM was featured by Gartner in Competitive Landscape IT service providers to the Global Insurance Industry Report. That is probably one of the first recognition by Gartner of our industry expertise and a result of our efforts to bring insurance consultancy and implementation services simultaneously for the clients' benefits. Putting together insurance consulting advisory practice was one of the key efforts for us during the last few years. Similar efforts today are underway in healthcare and life science, retail and distribution, oil and gas demand, [if you ask] (ph). In Q4 2023, EPAM was featured in Forrester report, the Cybersecurity Consulting Services Landscape Q4 2023. EPAM was highlighted as one of the top 33 cybersecurity consulting services providers, which is probably first recognition of a critical capability we are developing for the last years. Now, about some established capabilities, which were confirmed recently. In November, 2023, EPAM was recognized as the top 3 companies in the Magic Quadrant for Critical Capabilities for Customer Software Development Services Worldwide by Gartner. EPAM leadership and strengths were specifically highlighted in leveraging generative AI, pioneering DevOps and providing superior customer support and unique user experience. In November, December 2023, IDC named EPAM as a leader in three reports: IDC MarketScape for Worldwide Experienced Design Services Vendor Assessment; IDC MarketScape for Worldwide Experienced Built Services Vendor Assessment; and IDC MarketScape for Worldwide Software Engineering Services Vendor Assessment. Finally, Ad Age recognized EPAM as the number six largest agencies in the United States and number 18 in the world's largest agencies companies categories. In just seven years, EPAM has moved from number 130 to number six among US agencies. Before I hand over the call to Jason, I would like to take a moment to share a couple of points on some aspects of our results for 2023 and our outlook for 2024. In 2023, we generated $4.69 billion in revenues, reflecting a correction of 2.8% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exiting our Russian operations, revenue declined 1.8%. Adjusted income from operations was 16.3% of revenue and above the midpoint of our initial guided range. Also, the current market conditions don't represent at all an ideal demand environment for EPAM. Our 2023 results highlight our commitment to adapting the company to suit the current circumstances while continuously preparing for the more beneficial demand environment in the future. What I want to point out as well is that our Q4 results shows a sequential revenue growth, first time after three previous quarters of sequential declines. About 2024 outlook: Because of our ability to adapt to new client demands and market conditions, we are optimistic about the opportunities ahead of us towards the end of 2024. Demand to build postponed during the last two years should rebound, driven by long-term pressures for legacy modernizations, by needs for advanced customer-centric solutions, and by the massive interest to understand how to apply GenAI and general AI capabilities to build new platforms and solutions. Even while we continue to navigate current economic and geopolitical environment carefully, we will invest in strategic initiatives organically and with support of expanded M&A activities, in demand generation efforts and in people programs. This will have some effect on our profitability in 2024, but we believe these are the right actions to ensure long-term growth and stronger market positions. Let me turn the call over to Jason to provide more details on our fourth quarter and full year results in addition to our initial view of 2024 expectations.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, EPAM generated revenues of $1.16 billion, a year-over-year decrease of 6% on a reported basis and a 7.3% decrease in constant currency terms, reflecting a positive foreign exchange impact of 130 basis points. The reduction in Russian customer revenues, resulting from our decision to exit the market, had a 70 basis point negative impact on year-over-year revenue growth. The modest sequential growth in the quarter was the result of stabilizing demand. Revenues in Q4 were higher than we expected when we said Q4 guidance, due to both stronger client demand and significant benefit from favorable foreign exchange. Beginning with our industry verticals. Life sciences and healthcare grew 11.6%. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by clients in life sciences. Travel and consumer decreased 4.4%, with solid growth in travel and hospitality, offset by declines in revenues derived from consumer goods and retail customers. Financial services contracted 7.1%, driven by declines in banking, partially offset by work performed from marketplace exchange and finance information and analytics clients. Excluding the impact of the exit of our Russian operations, revenue on a year-over-year basis declined 5.5%. Business information and media declined 14.8% in the quarter. Revenues in the quarter continued to be impacted primarily by a reduction in spend across a number of large clients, due to uncertainty in their end markets, particularly in the mortgage data space. Software and hi-tech declined 16.8% in the quarter. The year-over-year growth rate was negatively impacted by the reduction in revenue from our former top 20 client we mentioned during our previous earnings calls and generally slower growth in revenues across the range of customers in the vertical. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered growth of 4.2%, driven by clients in energy, manufacturing and education. From a geographic perspective, the Americas, our largest region representing 58% of our Q4 revenues, declined 7.6% year-over-year or 7.7% in constant currency. On a sequential basis, growth remained relatively flat, consistent with the previous quarter. EMEA, representing 39% of our Q4 revenues, was flat year-over-year and declined 3.5% in constant currency. APAC declined 10.9% in both reported and constant currency terms and now represents 2% of our revenues. And finally, CEE, representing 0.1% of our Q4 revenues, contracted 91.6% year-over-year or 91.3% in constant currency. Revenue in the quarter was impacted by the exit of our operations in Russia. Going forward, I will no longer comment on the CEE region in our quarterly prepared remarks, given that its revenue contribution is immaterial relative to our total revenues. In Q4, revenues from our top 20 clients declined 5% year-over-year, while revenues from clients outside our top 20 contracted 7%. Moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 31.1% compared to 32.4% in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 33% compared to 34.1% for the same quarter last year. Gross margin in Q4 2022 was positively impacted by the timing of year-end revenue recognition. GAAP SG&A was 18.5% of revenue compared to 16.6% in Q4 of last year. GAAP SG&A in the quarter was impacted by one-time charges, including expenses associated with the company's cost optimization program. Non-GAAP SG&A came in at 14.2% of revenue compared to 14.8% in the same period last year. SG&A expense for Q4 2023 reflects some cost efficiencies achieved in the quarter, as well as lower variable compensation compared to Q4 2022. GAAP income from operations was $122 million or 10.6% of revenue in the quarter compared to $170 million or 13.8% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $200 million or 17.3% of revenue in the quarter compared to $220 million or 17.8% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 23.4% versus our Q4 guide of 24%, due to greater-than-expected excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by higher state taxes and the impact of losses in certain non-US acquired subsidiaries. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which includes the impact of state taxes and subsidiary losses and excludes excess tax benefits, was 25.1%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.66. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.75, reflecting a decrease of $0.18 or 6.1% compared to the same quarter in 2022. In Q4, there were approximately 58.9 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to cash flow and our balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q4 was $171 million compared to $186 million in the same quarter of 2022. Free cash flow was $161 million compared to free cash flow of $165 million in the same quarter last year. We ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. At the end of Q4, DSO was 71 days and compares to 73 days in Q3 2023, and 70 days in the same quarter last year. Share repurchases in the fourth quarter were approximately 143,000 shares for $36.5 million, at an average price of $255.96 per share. As of December 31, we had approximately $335 million of share repurchase authority remaining. Now, moving on to a few operational metrics for the quarter. We ended Q4 with more than 47,350 consultants, designers, engineers, trainers and architects, a decline of 10.4% compared to Q4 2022. This is the result of lower levels of hiring, combined with both voluntary and involuntary attrition, as we continue to balance supply and demand. Our total headcount for the quarter was more than 53,150 employees. Utilization was 74.4% compared to 73.6% in Q4 of last year and 72.7% in Q3 2023. Turning to our full year results for 2023. Revenues for the year were $4.69 billion, producing a decline of 2.8% reported, and a decline of 3.4% in constant currency terms compared to 2022. Excluding Russia revenues, the reported year-over-year growth rate would have been negative 1.8% reported and negative 2.4% in constant currency terms. GAAP income from operations was $501 million, a decrease of 12.5% year-over-year and represented 10.7% of revenue. Our non-GAAP income from operations was $765 million, a decrease of 6.5% compared to the prior year and represented 16.3% of revenue. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 22.3%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.7%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $7.06. Non-GAAP EPS, which excludes adjustments for stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs and certain other one-time items, including costs associated with our cost optimization program, was $10.59, reflecting a 2.8% decrease over fiscal 2022. In 2023, there were approximately 59.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Cash flow from operations was $563 million compared to $464 million for 2022. And free cash flow was $534 million, reflecting an 85.4% adjusted net income conversion. And finally, share repurchases in 2023 were approximately 686,000 shares for $164.9 million at an average price of $240.49 per share. Our 2023 results reflect EPAM's ability to manage the business through challenging macro conditions, while positioning the company for the return to a more normalized demand environment. Now, let's turn to guidance. Before moving to the specifics of our 2024 and Q1 outlook, I would like to provide some thoughts to help frame our guidance. As Ark mentioned, the demand environment remains uneven and we believe this will persist at least in the first half of 2024. We have been pleased with the progress we are making on demand generation, and we'll continue to prioritize revenue growth into 2024, which, in some pursuits, include some degree of discounting. In 2024, we expect to incur incremental costs due to more normalized variable compensation levels, in addition to wage inflation in certain geographies. This higher level of compensation, combined with the limited ability to improve client pricing in the near term, will continue to put pressures on margins in 2024. Finally, despite the war, our operations in Ukraine have not been materially impacted, and our teams remain highly focused on maintaining uninterrupted production. Our guidance assumes that we will continue to be able to deliver from our Ukraine delivery centers at productivity levels similar to those achieved in 2023. Now, starting with the full year outlook. Revenue growth will be in the range of 1% to 4%, on both a reported and constant currency basis. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be negligible. At this time, we expect a nominal revenue contribution from inorganic revenue for 2024. Lastly, we are seeing some improvement of demand, but the visibility for the year is still limited. Although we are guiding to modest sequential growth in Q1, increases in demand may not sufficiently offset revenue impacts resulting from seasonality in all quarters in 2024. We expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 21%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, will be 24%. Earnings per share, we expect the GAAP diluted EPS will be in the range of $7.20 to $7.60 for the full year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS will be in the range of $10 to $10.40 for the full year. We expect weighted average share count of 59.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For Q1 of 2024, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.155 billion to $1.165 billion, producing a year-over-year decline of approximately 4%, with the expected impact of FX to be minimal. For the first quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 9% to 10%, and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%. Our Q1 income from operations guide reflects the impact of the resetting of social security caps, normalized variable compensation and somewhat higher bench levels, where we expect to see improvement throughout the year. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 11% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation to be approximately 24%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.79 to $1.87 for the quarter, and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.26 to $2.34 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59.1 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for 2024. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $198 million, with $44 million in Q1, $48 million in Q2 and $53 million in each remaining quarter. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $26 million for the year, evenly spread across each quarter. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be a $1 million loss for each of the quarters. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be approximately $46 million for the year, with $11 million in Q1, $11 million in Q2 and $12 million in each remaining quarter. We expect excess tax benefits to be around $28 million for the full year, with approximately $17 million in Q1, $5 million in Q2 and $3 million in each remaining quarter. Finally, one more assumption outside of our GAAP to non-GAAP items. Our growing cash reserves are generating interest income, and EPAM is receiving governmental incentives from several countries in which we established delivery operations. As a result, in 2024, we are anticipating an increased level of other income. We expect interest and other income to be around $66 million for the full year, with $16 million in Q1, $20 million in Q2 and $15 million in each remaining quarter. My thanks to all the EPAMers who made 2023 a successful year, and will help us drive growth throughout 2024. Operator, let's open the call up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ramsey El Assal of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Ramsey El Assal: Hi. Thank you for taking my question this morning. I wanted to ask about your view on the second half of '24 sort of inflection. You sounded incrementally confident, I think, that the demand environment might pivot into a positive direction at that point. Can you just comment further on what's giving you confidence in this visibility? Are client conversations changing? Are you seeing a backlog of delayed projects build up? What has changed in your forward view that's supporting this sort of incrementally positive sense that the second half is where things may inflect?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it's exactly what you said. We were [taking] (ph) a lot of activities in Q4 and a lot of conversations still happening today, but decision going to delay still. And in our view, how these activities were increased, we do believe that future delays would be very difficult to kind of hold, because the companies will need to address [growing debt] (ph). And we've taken, at least, we're thinking right now pretty responsible view of what might be happening at this type of increase based on discussion of many programs and kind of desires which we have during the last months should become to some realization. And we kind of planning and shaping our activities around it.
Ramsey El Assal: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Bryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to start on margin here. So, good result in the 4Q AOM. Can you talk about maybe what costs and investments now are most notable that come back in for '24 and the cadence considerations? I heard some investments in demand gen and go to market, I think. Can you flush that a bit more? And I guess the root of the question is, what do you consider more transitory versus potentially structural cost differences as you go forward?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So, we obviously have been very thoughtful around what our cost structure would look like this year and are mindful of the guide here around profitability. The decision we made Bryan was that we did want to return to a more typical variable compensation. And then, we thought a lot about the pricing environment and the wage environment, and decided that we would move forward with our traditional sort of salary increases or promo in Q2 of this year. We've got very low voluntary attrition. We want to keep it that way because we do have confidence in return to growth later in the year. So, I would say the people programs are probably most significant, but then we do have significant investments in AI and again we thought about whether or not we would want to scale those back and we thought that, that wasn't appropriate considering some of the traction that we believe that we're getting in AI at this point. And then, as you talked about the programs that are primarily focused on sort of demand generation, some of our partnership programs and then continuing to enhance our domain capabilities. And I don't know, Ark, if you have any thoughts about either the AI or the demand generation.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yeah. As everybody say, it's still a lot of experimentation, but we highlighted something which we do. And there is a quest to implementations happening as we speak. Still the program is not very sizable, but what we also see is that a lot of proof of concepts actually proven to the point that it will trigger additional tail of data engineering programs a lot, because while experimentation going well and proof of concept looking good, usually the data for this type of activities is [massaged] (ph) well enough, and as soon as you go into production activities in many cases, it's triggered visibly need to invest in data engineering and different activities to at scale provide the data. And that's why also we believe that this trigger will happen and the amount of work for these type of activities will bear some fruits to us as well.
Jason Peterson: Yes, we think there'll clearly be a return on the AI investment. And then, Bryan, we'll be working on utilization and our seniority pyramids throughout the year. I think you'll see an improvement in gross margin in the second half of 2024, hopefully setting us up for more better profitability in 2025.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. Thanks. And then follow-up just as it relates to kind of your larger client cohort expectations, are the ramp down that you had thought as you entered '24 progressing as you had expected? And is the second-half improvement consistent across your larger clients? I'm thinking about your top 10, your top 20 base.
Jason Peterson: Yeah. We had talked about a known and expected ramp down in Q1 that is upon us and it is obviously part of our Q1 guide. Other than that, you don't see significant incremental kind of ramp downs and we are feeling like demand is stabilizing. From a customer standpoint, we are seeing good strong traction in life sciences. We clearly are seeing a lot of opportunities and energy, and I expect that we'll probably return to sequential growth in a number of our industry verticals here in Q1. So, I would say, yeah, it's generally that the demand is a little broader from at least an industry vertical and customer standpoint.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman of Stifel. Please go ahead.
David Grossman: Good morning. Thank you. I'm just looking at the headcount adds, and it looks like you're, on a year-over-year basis, pretty much down in most geographies, I think, with the exception of a couple or maybe just India. And I guess I'm just trying to understand and juxtapose that dynamic against expectation of accelerating growth in the back half of the year, and perhaps you're targeting a higher utilization rate than you experienced in '23 or other factors at play. And just wondering if you could help flush that out for us. And whether or not the kind of changing -- how we should think about the changing geographic mix and its impact on growth given the bill rate differential between India, for example, and Ukraine and Eastern Europe?
Jason Peterson: Yeah. So, good questions. The first that I would say is as you look at that our fact sheet where you can see us with the headcount declines across a range of geographies, if we [indiscernible] kind of Ark's comments here during, I guess, the fixed portion of today is that we did obviously have to increase headcount across a broad range of countries. It's kind of a contingency in case things didn't go as well as they ultimately ended up going in Ukraine. And so, we then afterwards tuned headcount somewhat just because we've done some amount of access hiring across a broad range of geographies, just as contingency in case we weren't able to deliver successfully from Ukraine. At this point, you're clearly seeing growth in India. You'll continue to see growth in Latin America. We do expect that the incremental growth in India is going to put some pressure on revenue per headcount. And that's part of the reason for the guide of the 1% to 4% that we've got in there.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think I would add to the follow-up. Like, if you remember our original guide, one year ago, at the beginning of 2023, so it was a way kind of optimistic and revenue was higher than we guided today for 2024. So, which means that we prepare it for the growth and number of people that you have back then were corresponding to our source. Then, 2023, in this case, become for us an adjustment period when we have to bring relative numbers to this kind of to reality. And on top of this, as we've changed, we were adjusting our thinking about market from cost perspective as well. So, 2023 was actually 12 months when we were bringing us back to shape to changing condition. From this point of view, it's very much in line with our guidance for this year. We're still keeping the series kind of investments to be able to start hiring back to trade in big quantities, so we feel about this number as pretty comfortable and actually reflecting the reality.
David Grossman: So, if I take those comments and the comments you in a previous question about the margin dynamic for the year, does that imply that the cadence of margins should improve or if we think about margin improvement as '24 progresses, that we'll get back to kind of more of a historical level as we exit '24?
Jason Peterson: Certainly, I expect lower gross margins in the first half, that's both Q1 and Q2, and then, a fairly significant improvement in the second half, and that would be both due to the available bill days as well as improvements in utilization and pyramid. So, I don't know whether or not that's the same as where we've been kind of historically, but I do expect us to head back towards more typical profitability as we get closer to the end of the year and as we enter 2025.
David Grossman: All right. Got it. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Puneet Jain from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Puneet Jain: Hey, thanks for taking my question, and good quarter. So, Ark, you mentioned like that there is some like the adjustment of seniority of employees back ahead of you, probably something you'll do this year. Could you share like if your average experience like running above normal due to maybe low attrition, low hiring right now? And what should we expect for revenue per employee as like if average experience deteriorates a little bit?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think this adjustment is happening. What I don't believe is the revenue per employee exactly the kind of the metric which reflects the reality because it depends very much how we kind of optimizing our delivery locations. India is growing, and India, for example, growing not little, I think it's 20% last year. I think it was much higher a year before, like more than 50%, okay? So, which has actually definitely impacted revenue per employee. It's the same like switch between people moving from Eastern Europe to Central Europe, or growing in Latin America, that should be taken into account, not talking about [indiscernible]. So, simply not looking to this metric as a critical metric for us.
Puneet Jain: Got it. And your utilization like it improved on sequential basis like what should we expect for normalized utilization given that you are operating under a much more distributed delivery model now?
Jason Peterson: Yeah. I mean, our goal would be to go back towards more typical, which was above the higher 70%s. So, I don't think that the distribution is going to have a significant impact on our targeted utilization levels.
Puneet Jain: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Maggie Nolan of William Blair. Please go ahead.
Maggie Nolan: Hi, thank you. Jason, can you be a little bit more explicit on your commentary about seasonality versus demand offset on a quarter-by-quarter basis, and maybe just remind us which quarters are going to be more difficult to overcome seasonal pressures given that, that may be different from historical given your changing geographic footprint and holiday schedules, et cetera?
Jason Peterson: Okay, great. Thanks for giving me the chance to clarify that. So, Q2 is generally -- it's less capacity or less sort of available bill days. Q3 is usually very strong quarter. So, usually we see quite significant sort of sequential growth Q2 to Q3. The comment that I made in my prepared remarks was really that we are seeing what feels like a better demand environment, more stability, large number of conversations with clients and some kind of larger deal size opportunities, but Q1 to Q2 definitely has a negative seasonal impact. And so, I just wanted to call out that there was some potential that, that seasonality could cause us to be sequentially flat to maybe even possibly down, but generally the expectations are that we'd see sequential growth Q1 to Q2, but again, it will take definitely improving demand environment to get us there.
Maggie Nolan: Okay. Thank you. And then, you've mentioned pricing for a couple of different quarters now and sharpening your pencils. Are you doing anything that you feel will help protect your ability to raise pricing in future quarters and years? And how do you get comfortable with the level that you're setting your rate cards to now versus ability to increase in the future?
Jason Peterson: There's probably a few things going on. I think we're trying to make certain that we don't have multi-year commitments that kind of lock us in. Even when you do, you do have opportunities to come back to clients. So, generally, Maggie, I would say traditional [indiscernible] structures for us are about a year in length. The other thing that we are continuing to do and I think you would see it in the mix of our commercials is that you're seeing more fixed fee engagements, where there's a more -- not only is it more sort of consulting led, but also there's a little bit more opportunity for us to take responsibility for delivery, and that gives us an opportunity to improve profitability as well.
Maggie Nolan: Thanks for all the detail.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. In terms of just as we look at the year ahead, how much of a reshaping of the pyramid do you think you need at this point in terms of having the appropriate skillset for the demand environment as it evolves? And then, I guess, related to that, how quickly are you able to hire at this point if there was an increase in demand in terms of how much bench do you need to keep and how quickly can you hire against that?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Look, I think it's interesting question to address. First of all, because there is a lot of uncertainty even how quickly productivity will be growing and we're watching this very, very carefully, what type of new people will be needed actually in the market. And we put in a lot of investment efforts and that's what we shared already, specifically in these activities. What it means that we need to like to watch practically month by month, quarter by quarter, how productivity improvements would be realized and how clients will be kind of supporting this, because there are a lot of questions about legal aspects of generating the code or doing assisted -- AI-assisted development. So, it's about what actually we'll need, like, year from now or later. So, on the ability to hire -- and again, we invest here, we play and we're watching this very, very carefully. So, on the ability to hire, we're keeping all our core previous investments in educational training for juniors, and again, it's how and what we're going to train is changing on the fly during the last time, and we're going to continue changing. But we're pretty confident that we would be able to accelerate when needed, especially with the softness of the market. During the last several years, a lot of talent was produced on the market in junior levels, which is not necessary while finding jobs. So, I think it's building up right now and when market will be back with everything what we did before, we feel kind of normal to increase capacity.
Jason Peterson: Yeah. We continue to have -- we're flexible. We clearly have been investing to make certain that we can add capacity across a broad range of geographies. So, we feel good about our ability to respond to demand.
Surinder Thind: Got it. I guess just as a clarification. So, the idea is that you can hire within a quarter to address needs in terms of having the flexibility, the capability, the training? I guess that's kind of what I was trying to get at.
Jason Peterson: Yeah, I think, that would be fair. We've got obviously utilization opportunities, first and foremost, but then, yeah, a quarter window would probably be appropriate.
Arkadiy Dobkin: This is all proportionally...
Surinder Thind: Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: In one quarter, the demand will not jump as crazy. So, it's still going to be spread around the quarter. We're still not -- don't seem right now the demand will be performing kind of in 2021. It will be much more softer. And if you remember 2021 and it was very quickly become hot market, we were performing pretty well.
Surinder Thind: That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri of Woodburn Securities. Please go ahead.
Moshe Katri: Hey, thanks. Congrats on strong execution. Ark, when you started the call, you indicated the clients that moderated spending with EPAM last year are coming back. Can you talk a bit more about that? Is it that they went to some of your competitors are coming back, they're changing their plans? What's prompting that? That -- yeah.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we were talking about it many times during the last year, but at the beginning of the year when we were much more optimistic, we didn't realize that impact of the war raised risk profile for EPAM and uncertainty that we will be able to navigate the war. So, a lot of calls clients were doing in the middle of 2022 which kind of delaying decision with us or actually going to -- starting to replace, not put a new [repeats] (ph) to us, but unfortunately, we realized impact of this only kind of at the end of the Q1 2023. And some of these actions make a pretty long-term impact. We still have clients who declining, because when decision is done and they signed with somebody else, it's happening. So, this is very visible impact in 2023. Plus, economy -- and that's why I would say the simultaneous impact of these two things were the most critical for us, which really put us aside from our competitors, which was only one part of this challenges. So, when economy started to slow down, then again, competition for rates, cost and everything else pick up. And this was second one. So, positive things which we also mentioned that there are some clients who are coming back to us, and some of them growing as well, but definitely this is part of 2023 and partially will be, for us, part of 2024. If you think at the same time that how we were bringing some new business to compensate this, that's kind of a positive part of the story. Declining in 2024 definitely will be smaller than decline it was at 2023.
Jason Peterson: And, Moshe, we continue to see clients who may have experimented with other vendors, reengaging with us with both discussions and in some cases actually transferring work back to us just based on the fact that they didn't get as much done with those other vendors.
Moshe Katri: That makes sense. And is that because they're more comfortable with your execution from places like India or Latin America? Is that kind of...
Arkadiy Dobkin: It's -- yeah. It's multiple factors. Some of them become much more comfortable with Ukraine because it was any impact of the quality of interruption. So, some were thinking we'll be leaving and now staying there. So it's also, we prove that we can deliver from different locations. India was probably one of the kind of major critical components here. And third one, I think that when you're removing some order works to some competitors, the results were not satisfactory as they started to come back to us or waiting when their commitments with new vendors will be kind of expired, and it will be possible to come back. So, I think it's between all these lines.
Moshe Katri: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Darrin Peller: Yeah, guys. I want to follow-up a bit on the competitive landscape for a minute. And the main question is really just sort of circling back. You said you're seeing some customers come back to you. You also talked about adding a ton of new, I think, more than usual new customers over the past year, and you're seeing that progressing into this year. So, putting that all into context, just there's been a lot of discussion of competitors trying to be more aggressive, taking advantage of what happened in the war in Ukraine. What are you seeing competitively? I mean, has anything truly changed? And then, maybe dovetailing that into the potential we could see for this year, you said you added a bunch more than usual new customers you've been adding at a run rate. I guess that informs your decision on what you're seeing in terms of guidance for the second half of the year. Why not a little bit more in the first half since it was being added last year? Thanks, guys.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, I think when we're talking about increasing the client number, it's true the difference with previous year that this is smaller clients, smaller --- clients maybe not smaller, but smaller engagements. And overall, it still feel a lot of pressure from all, more competitiveness. And it's all coming back to our statement that we actually adjusted our behavior during the 2023, okay, and started to use different approaches to kind of protect client base as well. But it was much more visible all the transition between first half and second half of 2023. We're still seeing that something similar will be continuous for this and next quarter. And that exactly explain all these dynamics and competitive situation. We see that clients starting the programs, we participated in this bigger programs than they were considering in the first half of 2023. So, we think this acceleration will be happening and second half will give us opportunity to demonstrate it. One word I just -- okay. I lost the point which I was bringing. Maybe later, I'll add.
Darrin Peller: Thank you.
Jason Peterson: If we do all right, definitely stronger new logo activity, stronger new customer revenues. Don't forget that we do have the ramp down in Q1 from the one customer. And as Ark said, some kind of slower kind of decision making, but again generally the demand environment at least feels like it's stabilizing and potentially improving.
Operator: Thank you. So, the final question...
Arkadiy Dobkin: Well, what I wanted to say is actually my -- our usual remark. Until the full speed, what we kind of all expecting from margins and from the real growth, it's still function of right demands. And this right demand, we consider it will start to be realized on second part, okay? At what level? So, we put it conservative right now. At least we think that it's conservative or realistic right now. Yeah. So, what would be happening still this year, definitely less predictable than kind of before war years. We all know that it's not about us, it's about the whole the IT segment.
David Straube: So, we'll do one last quick call or question, and then wrap up?
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Sean Kennedy of Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Sean Kennedy: Hi, everyone. Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. So, I understand it's still very early on, GenAI, but what specific types of GenAI capabilities are your clients most excited about currently, and you expect those to change as the technology matures?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, I think, still there are, at this point, a lot of experimentation and a lot of kind of more straightforward thinking about GenAI, as it's available practically for the end consumers and how this can change interfaces. And again, very straightforward that everybody is thinking how to have a right access to the hybrid data between general sales, the specific ones and most of the companies experimenting in this area and created some type of copilots. And I'm talking about application of areas and just utilizing GenAI as a activity tools for individuals and [we work as subs] (ph). I'm talking about, like, client-facing capabilities, new insight. The difficulties of this is it will be changing quarter by quarter. And, I think some exciting things which we see right now would become very quickly commodity and much more sophisticated since it'll be happening like 12 months from now.
Sean Kennedy: Got it. Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Very early, like you said.
Sean Kennedy: All right. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Arkadiy Dobkin, Chief Executive Officer and President, for concluding remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you very much as usual for your questions. I think we're feeling in general this stabilization happening. At the same time, we're feeling that a lot of unknowns ahead of us and some trends, which were driving the market and our performance in 2023, still actually critical for 2024, but, yeah, we feel much better after showing that we can stabilize the revenue, the client base, and even little but some growth versus continuous decline, which was happening in previous four quarters. Thank you very much, and talk to you in three months.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-02 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and thank you for standing by. My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to EPAM's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
David Straube: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2023 results. If you have not, copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website. With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. Before I get into results of our third quarter, I would like to recap what was certain in regards to our expectations for Q3 and full year outlook three months ago during our last call. We stated that while the current business environment is more focused on cost optimization versus our differentiated build and deploy [Indiscernible]. We do believe the demand for transformation services will come back under the services market. You'll be moving from core IT to accelerated digitization to reinvent into our business models and ways of working with generative AI as the core of the transformation. And that we expect this new demand to be underpinned and even more driven exactly by our traditionally strong product platform engineering, data analytics and AI ML capabilities. At the same term, we said we still expect the negative dynamic to continue into second part of 2023. Here is when the outlook begins to normalize. We stated that we are focusing on -- towards new experience from very challenging past waters into pragmatic plans and action items, which will be applied to our business throughout the rest of 2023 and into 2024. These changes are transformational for us and already better positioning us in preparation for the return of stronger market demand. That was the first part of our premise. The second critical part was about our efforts to further globalize and stabilize our delivery ecosystem propagate engineering quality standards and optimize operationally our target allocations, while closely focusing on our gross margin improvement efforts. We also continue throughout the remainder of this year and I expect it to go throughout 2024. So with that reminder, let's talk about three key topics to address our demand environment, global capabilities and key investments. Demand, we believe that while the demand for the new build for platform application remains lower than historic levels and the impact of ramp-downs in the quarters continue to work through specific client portfolios. Our Q3 results point to sign of stabilization in our business both in new logos and in retail and expanded programs in our existing portfolio, we are seeing signs of renewed interest, particularly in our life science and healthcare verticals also in insurance and energy and not only that. What is important to highlight in today's business environment, we are putting all possible efforts to address our client current priorities including addressing the mix of engagement models, cost takeouts and consolidation initiatives, while protecting our share of wallet and long-term relationships. While these factors are leading sometimes to likely lower short-term profitability metrics, we are seeing signs that clients are returning to balance between cost and quality and the pump continues to be well-positioned there. Also it required today an increased focus on demand led sales and go-to-market motions and investments in global partnerships, to win and quickly growing new business. Over the last quarters, our global field organizations and our specialized practice teams are focused on developing new offerings in key verticals and horizontals expand into new engagement models and extending our client portfolio to include new logos across the broader structure of our brands, from large enterprises to mid-market players to new and exciting start-ups in key collaborations. And more and more often we are engaging with clients at a [indiscernible] of both IT and business functions. One of the examples of those relatively new for us ways to engage is strengthening our partnerships, which have taken on a greater momentum recently with key collaborations driving net new go-to-market propositions, new IP and new client wins. Last quarter, we shared our global partnership with Google Cloud to help our clients fast track the development of artificial intelligence machine learning and data solutions to help them accelerate their transformations into AI-enabled business. Earlier this week, we announced standing strategic collaboration agreement with AWS. This will aim to accelerate modernization adapt cloud-native, architecture and leverage artificial intelligence and advanced analytics to create customer value in key industries such as health care, life science, financial services insurance, energy and gaming. Furthermore, we expanded our partnership with Microsoft, becoming a globally managed enterprise system integrator. The enhanced partner status and EPAM advanced cloud nature AI and data expertise, will enable us to help our clients modernize transform and simplify complex enterprise platform application and processes, to accelerate business growth powered by Azure OpenAI service. Current results of these efforts are showing up an increasing number of conversations with clients and growing numbers of opportunities. And while it's still too early to say, when we can show significant result in revenue growth, our production load is starting to come back to the level of comparable result of Q1. And we hope, to see this trend takes shape during the next quarters. Still, despite signs of improving demand conditions, the global macroeconomic environment remains volatile and we see certain trends reflecting in our own builds notably in Europe, where the contraction in the third quarter is likely to take a few quarters to previous. Now, we are down to global capabilities. India and LatAm for us are key growth delivery regions while Central Eastern Europe and Central Western Asia are areas of stabilization, after our massive allocation efforts. And we've seen future growth opportunities. Part of the effort regarding globalization and stabilization of delivery, is the rightsizing and cost optimization across multiple locations based on current and future demand outlook and specific location capabilities seniority of pyramids and office infrastructures. Some identical efforts are also relevant in several locations in Western Europe and North America. While optimizing some locations, we continue to reinvest in new talent in key initiatives to expand our engineering G&A across all strategic, global delivery locations with continuous harmonization and upskilling efforts, enabled by our own use of AI and EPAM productivity platforms. Those efforts are on the way, as we speak. And we're already seeing first results and expect to have additional benefits to materialize in 2024. This brings us to the topic of additional investments, which we mentioned in the past multiple times. We are continuously investing in our strategic priorities such as, expansion of differentiated consulting agency data ML AI and cloud capabilities with focus on vertical expertise. Development of go-to-market with cost-effective solutions, which now include propositions related to use of responsible AI across a broad range of business and technology use cases. Our strong cloud engineering data and ML core services profile should position EPAM to benefit in the medium and long term from the impact of both current pent-up demand for modernization and also from the fundamental skills shortage in concrete technological transformations, which still persist today. The impact will become even more real in terms of complexity of future applications, and platforms by encapsulating not just currently available elements of Gen AI and requirements for trust reliability and security management of AI, but also by closely integrated with new classes of composite and adaptive AI platforms as well as with foundational models and specific industry cloud platforms. One of the key propositions offered by EPAM is our ability to make real -- as part of this focus a number of our labs and centers of excellence have created IP that we are using to productize our learning's and to share them with our clients through our own open-source initiatives. We mentioned our work with Dial our AI orchestration work bench in our previous call. And today, we see a number of extensions of this platform into specific use cases and specific industries based on real-life problems, which we have addressed with a growing variety of integrated AI tools and data sources. One of our more significant investments related to AI is a development and internal rollout of EPAM responsible AI framework, and a broad in play training to adapt it. Today, we are confident that EPAM has necessary capabilities and talent to help our clients to evolve in the general adoption of AI, and also in modernization of applications and proper data engineering efforts to drive the value AI promised to bring. Conversations with our clients are evolving as it becomes generally understood that fundamental capabilities and readiness in cloud and medium in data are necessary prerequisites for success. Till the level of interest continues to indicate the demand for our related services will build momentum into 2024 and beyond. I believe that provides a good level of overview of current state and our key areas of focus. To summarize, I would like to say that with the exciting opportunities in front of us. We are still facing a complete demand environment. We are working to invest for the future while balancing supply and demand for skills and capabilities across a much more diverse delivery footprint. This challenge continues as the war in Ukraine extends into the third year as well as the new disruptions in Middle East escalations require us to continuously adapt the company in appropriate manner. I would think at this point, we feel being well trained to manage all of the them well. So with that, I would like to pass to Jason to share more details and numbers for Q3 and for an update for our business outlook for the remainder of 2023.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, EPAM generated revenue of over $1.15 billion a year-over-year decrease of 6.1% on a reported basis, or 8% in constant currency terms, reflecting a favorable foreign exchange impact of 190 basis points. Revenue in the quarter continued to be impacted by reduced program spending across a number of our clients, as well as ongoing client cost and related to new project starts. The reduction in Russian customer revenues resulting from our exit from the market had an approximate 50 basis point negative impact on year-over-year revenue growth. Excluding Russia revenues year-over-year revenue for reported a constant currency would have decreased by 5.6% and 7.6% respectively. Beginning with our industry verticals on a year-over-year basis financial services decreased 3.3% driven by declines predominantly in banking, partially offset by growth in asset management. Consumer decreased by 6.2%, primarily due to declines in consumer goods partially offset by solid growth in travel and hospitality. Life sciences & health care declined 4.2%. The year-over-year growth rate was negatively impacted by the ramp down of a large transformational program in late 2022 which we have mentioned during our previous earnings call. On a sequential basis growth in life sciences & health care was a positive 8.6% and we expect to return to positive year-over-year growth next quarter. Business information & media declined 12% in the quarter. Revenue in the quarter was impacted by a reduction in spend across a number of large clients based on uncertainty in their end markets particularly in the mortgage data space. Software and Hi-Tech contracted 15.1%. The year-over-year growth rate was negatively impacted by the reduction in revenue from a former top 20 customers we mentioned during our previous earnings calls and generally slower growth in revenue across a range of customers in the vertical. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered solid growth of 8.5% driven by clients in energy, manufacturing and automotive. From a geographic perspective Americas our largest region representing 59% of our Q3 revenues declined 9.3% year-over-year or 9.5% in constant currency. On a sequential basis growth in the Americas was relatively flat an improvement from the declines in previous quarters in 2023. EMEA representing 39% of our Q3 revenues grew 1.8% year-over-year and decreased 3.5% in constant currency. CEE representing less than 1% of our Q3 revenues contracted 66.4% year-over-year or 58.8% in constant currency. Revenue in the quarter was impacted by EPAM's exit of its Russian operations. And finally APAC declined 20.2% year-over-year or 19.8% in constant currency terms and now represents 2% of our revenues. Revenue in the quarter was impacted primarily by the ramp down of work within our financial services vertical. In Q3, revenues from our top 20 clients declined 8.3% year-over-year, while revenues from clients outside our top 20 declined 4.9%. Moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 31.1% compared to 32.6% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 32.9% compared to 34.4% for the same quarter last year. Gross margin in Q3 2023 reflects the negative impact of pricing pressure and lower utilization partially offset by a lower level of variable compensation expense. GAAP SG&A was 16.9% of revenue compared to 16.1% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A in Q3 2023 came in at 14.4% of revenue compared to 14.1% in the same period last year. GAAP income from operations was $114 million or 9.9% of revenue in the quarter compared to $180 million or 14.7% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Included in our GAAP results in the quarter is a $25.9 million loss on the sale of the company's remaining holdings in Russia and $8.4 million in severance as we take steps to reduce our cost structure to better align with demand. Non-GAAP income from operations was $196 million or 17% of revenue in the quarter compared to $232 million or 18.9% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 26.3%, which includes a onetime tax charge connected to the disposal of holdings in Russia and lower-than-expected excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.2%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.65. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.73, reflecting a $0.37 decrease compared to the same quarter in 2022. In Q3 there were approximately 58.9 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q3 was $215 million compared to $252 million in the same quarter of 2022. Free cash flow was $211 million compared to free cash flow of $234 million in the same quarter last year. At the end of Q3, DSO was 73 days and compares to 71 days for Q2 2023 and 69 days for the same quarter last year. The uptick in DSO reflects an increase in the time some clients are taking in the review and approval of payments combined with the last day of the quarter falling on a weekend. Share repurchases in the third quarter were approximately 318,000 shares for $78.5 million at an average price of $246.44 per share. As of September 30, we had approximately $372 million of share repurchase authority remaining. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended Q3 with more than 48,500 consultants, designers, engineers, trainers and architects. Including the impact of our exit from Russia, production headcount has declined 10% compared to Q3 2022. This is the result of lower levels of hiring combined with both voluntary and involuntary attrition as we continue to balance supply and demand. Our total headcount for the quarter was more than 54,600 employees. Utilization was 72.7% compared to 73.5% in Q3 of last year and 75.1% in Q2 2023. Now, let's turn to our business outlook. We are encouraged by the results of our demand generation efforts and new customer revenues resulting from these efforts. However, the level of new customer revenues being generated is still not enough to offset the impact from existing project ramp downs and reduced spending from our top 20 clients. We are beginning to see a degree of demand stability emerging in our North American portfolio, but we are also expecting an impact from planned ramp-downs at several of our European customers. Although, there are encouraging signs, demand remains somewhat uncertain. In addition to the negative impact, the Q4 seasonality usually has on revenue, we've also had a large number of employees relocate to countries that celebrate December holidays. In Q4, we were also expecting unfavorable foreign exchange headwinds in comparison with Q3. These factors are producing a sequential decline in Q4 revenue, despite the stabilizing the demand environment. Our Ukrainian delivery organization continues to operate efficiently and our teams remain highly focused on maintaining uninterrupted production. Our guidance assumes that we will continue to deliver from Ukraine at productivity levels consistent with previous levels throughout 2023. During the third quarter, we elevated our focus on aligning our cost structure with the near-term demand environment, initiating a cost optimization program, designed to reduce operating costs by 2.5% to 3%. This effort is clearly more intentional than our previous supply and demand balancing efforts. We think it is necessary to take this action in part to allow for further investment across our strategic initiatives, demand generation efforts and people programs. As I mentioned earlier, we had $8.4 million in severance-related costs in Q3 of which $7.1 million related to the cost optimization program. In Q4, we expect to recognize a further $15 million in expenses as a result of this cost optimization program. We expect headcount will continue to decline in Q4 due to limited hiring and managed attrition, which will drive utilization slightly higher in the quarter. Moving to our full year outlook. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $4.663 billion to $4.673 billion reflecting a year-over-year decline of approximately 3%. On an organic constant currency basis excluding the impact of the exit from Russia, we expect revenue to also decline by 3%. We expect GAAP income from operations to now be in the range of 10% to 11% and non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 15% to 16%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to continue to be approximately 22%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation is expected to continue to be 23%. Earnings per share, we expect the GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.07 to $7.15 for the full year and non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $10.31 to $10.39 for the full year. We now expect weighted average share count at 59.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Moving to our Q4 2023 outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.13 billion to $1.14 billion, producing a year-over-year decline of 8%. On an organic constant currency basis excluding the impact of the exit from Russia, we expect revenue to also decline by approximately 8%. For the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP income operations to be in the range of 10% to 11% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 15% to 16%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. Earnings per share we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.67 to $1.75 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.47 to $2.55 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 58.8 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements in the fourth quarter. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $36.3 million. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $5.7 million. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be minimal. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $12 million. We expect excess tax benefits to be around $1.3 million and we expect to recognize approximately $15 million in expenses related to our cost optimization program. In addition to these customary GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments and consistent with the prior quarters in 2023, we expect to have ongoing non-GAAP adjustments in Q4 resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Please see our Q3 earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP guidance. Finally, one more assumption outside of our GAAP to non-GAAP items. With our significant cash position, we are generating a healthy level of interest income and are now expecting interest and other income to be $14 million in the fourth quarter. Looking beyond 2023, we intend to provide our 2024 business outlook during our fourth quarter earnings call scheduled for February. However, I would like to provide some commentary at this time to help frame our initial thoughts. As Ark mentioned, the demand environment remains uneven and we believe this will persist at least into the first half of 2024. We have been pleased with the progress we're making on demand generation and we'll continue to prioritize revenue growth into 2024 which in some pursuits include some degree of discounting. Additionally, in 2024, we expect to incur incremental costs due to more normalized variable compensation as well as salary increases from our annual compensation cycle which typically occurs in Q2. Although the cost optimization program will better align our 2024 cost structure, we still expect wage pressure combined with the limited ability to improve client pricing to continue to put pressure on margins. While 2023 has been a challenging year for the IT sector in EPAM, we remain confident in our ability to drive historical levels of revenue growth and profitability in a more normalized demand environment. Operator let's open the call up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Bryan Bergin: Hi, good morning guys. Thank you. I guess let's start on the demand stabilization trends that you highlighted here again. I heard you mentioned production load I think coming back toward 1Q levels. Can you dig in a bit more there? Is that prevalent across industries? And is it consistent across the large client cohort? And just anything how that informs early 2024 client tech budget discussions?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. Let me clarify what we mean. We're trying to see the trend what's happening with our production. It's not about revenue it's how much work we are doing. Because there are a lot of different parameters which is influenced revenue from FX to number of days to race to discounts and everything else. But from the load point of view, the trend is that we're seeing we're coming back to a number of people who are doing production work getting comparable to what we saw in Q1. That's what it means. It means that, in general, we find end of the way to stabilize our share of the business even with some businesses declining with us but with some new opportunities growing and some actually clients coming back to us. So, from demand environment we have and this is what we mentioned as well. We've seen more conversation about programs more opportunities. But exactly as we mentioned whereas this morning, there is no clear time line of realization of. So, it's still difficult to say but it seems like pressure on some clients to do work getting bigger. So, well starting to be realized and difficult to say especially with everything geopolitically moving as soon as we see right now. So, more conversations more opportunities to discuss pretty tangible but there is no clear strategy.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. Understood. And then my follow-up on the cost optimization plan. So, Jason what's the timeframe on achieving that savings target? And can you talk about how you're balancing efficiency here in the near-term versus global diversification investments for future growth?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So, the program is designed to achieve a somewhat over $100 million or as we talked about in the prepared remarks 2.5% to 3% of our cost structure. Most of the actions will be taken by the end of the year. And then I would say there would be some residual actions that would take place early in 2024 with the idea of giving us effectively $100-plus million in savings to allow us to further invest in 2024. And so that's in demand generation programs, things like partnership programs, it's in capabilities, generative AI further consulting. And then it also will allow us to effectively sort of fund a more normalized variable compensation in salary campaign next year. And so again, I expect much of the savings to be achieved by the end of this year and there'll be probably still some actions taken in Q1. Truly the costs that we talk about in Q3 and Q4 truly are incremental costs related to either severance payouts in different countries, facilities, lease exits other costs that are incremental and again allow us to achieve a certain amount of savings as we enter 2024.
Bryan Bergin: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.
Moshe Katri: Hey. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I want to focus a bit about your selling efforts and using India as one of those I guess the delivery centers to be able to kind of pitch those new engagements. Maybe you can talk about some of your successes here. And on top of that, how does that differ in terms of your ability to generate profitability, compared to what you have pre I guess hostilities in Eastern Europe. Maybe you can talk a bit about that.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think as we mentioned multiple times India is growing fast. India is still the investment for us as well from the investment to uplift the capabilities which we have there, because it's a relatively new location even if it is fastest growing for the last probably three years. So we built in purposely the same type of practices as we have globally from digital engagement to significant data practice and cloud practices. So -- and stability question is a difficult one in general in this environment, because the pressure everywhere from any locations which we have. So -- but I think we're seeing definitely opportunity to uplift the market demand coming back. And we are accumulating a lot of experience. Now we have very sizable programs there. So we also understand that we can hire people and hire them with comparable quality through additional investments which we do there. So I think we're pretty optimistic about this and with everything that's happened, as we mentioned several times. I think this will become proportionately much bigger part of EPAM deliveries.
Jason Peterson: Yeah. And I just follow in on the profitability. So as we talked about in the last call and again we'll continue to talk about here today is that, we continue to have some characteristics with heavier pyramid than we had traditionally operated with the ongoing kind of pressures on pricing and then some amount of wage inflation. And so, it's hard to sort of return for typical profitability, as we enter the next handful of quarters or maybe through most of 2024. But when we look at India, given some time and particularly more demand we think the ability to sort of run that geography at levels of profitability consistent with what we did in Eastern Europe is certainly possible and more than possible, I'd say likely. So it's just right now we're still working through as Ark said, some of the imbalances on pricing and again a heavier delivery pyramid.
Moshe Katri: Understood. And then in that context can you just remind us your headcount mix by Eastern Europe, Latin America and then India where are we today? And where do -- what sort of mix do we want to get to down the road?
Jason Peterson: Yeah. So we're clearly less than 30% in Eastern Europe and heading towards kind of low-20s. India is currently...
Arkadiy Dobkin: We are about 26%, 27% between Ukraine and Belarus, okay? Eastern Europe or Central Europe like, it's different, because we are pretty significantly present in Poland and Hungary and all of this. And India is becoming right around second largest delivery location Right now it's the second largest after Ukraine.
Moshe Katri: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Can you hear me now?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay. So, I guess, the question is when I look at your -- when I look at the results either by geography or by vertical and on a sequential basis, and I kind of compare the growth rates what they were 2Q versus the growth rate in 3Q, almost everything is either decel or relatively unchanged, you have obviously the very idiosyncratic thing going on with life sciences. And I'm wondering does that -- I'm trying to drive back with the -- with what I sense is a little bit more positivity in terms of commentary, because of stabilization. So can you comment on how the environmental conversations with clients have evolved over the course of the quarter was September radically different than July? How are things evolving in October? A little bit more color of where we are going in terms of what seems to be stabilization in more areas. That would be useful.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. I think, I got the general numbers and all because this is declining from amount of work, which we are doing right now is definitely stabilizing because if -- and it's difficult to have apples-to-apples comparison but with all our terms it's actually getting latest lot. There are still big programs in which we continue to decline best of the client decisions done in -- even during the last year. That's why you see some new clients. On the other side after this period, why there is a positivity, we see that for some local fixed programs clients coming back to us and started conversation or even some decisions when programs starting to come back to us. A lot of new opportunities but this was at the very beginning. Some of them sizable means that clients started to seriously consider as they need to do it. And unfortunately some of the client delays are so much, while there are very specific deadline they have ahead of them, and they will have to start making decisions. And this conversation happens, but they're still not making calls. But the level of conversation is a different level. That's a positivity as well. And there are a lot of small apart more new business where we enter in, which is historically for us, it wasn't very normal because it never was going to be problem from day one. It's usually where the country is important and the potential that we can do more complex, better quality work and then it was growing. So we have a lot of seats right now for the future. But as main point that we definitely see is as the production load is getting more stable.
Jason Peterson: Yeah. I think Ashwin also if you look clearly on a year-over-year basis, the numbers still don't look sequentially despite the fact we still saw a decline between Q2 and Q3. That decline was less than the decline we had in Q2. And when looking ahead to Q4, we still have a modest decline, but I would say that's largely sort of foreign exchange and to a certain extent as we talk about the build ability or the available build as in Q4. And so, if you adjust for that it does feel like our demand is stabilizing, particularly in North America as we talked about during our prepared remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And something to mention like I know that there are a lot of consumers that we would be able to deliver quality from new locations. That looks more positive as well for us, because we're getting more and more experience and more and more scales outside our traditional strength in Eastern Europe while again in Eastern Europe and Western Central Asia will also stabilize a little while in general geopolitical environment is still very, very complex.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: That last point is really good to hear. In terms of pricing, because when you kind of talk about transaction loan volume versus results, does that imply a soft pricing environment. And if you can break that down into how much of that is a geo-mix type of issue as opposed to apples-to-apples price crunching. And then, over the last few quarters, you have mentioned obviously that because of the war in Ukraine, you had to move equal to newer geographies and there was a pricing impact that clients needed to absorb because of that. Are we past the impact of that on client decision-making?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So let me quickly do on a year-over-year basis, you would have had the impact of those movements that we took people from Russia and Belarus and Ukraine and moved into higher-cost geographies. But if you begin to look at what's happening here in Q3 and what we think we see in Q4 is that you've got both the facts. And unfortunately, I can't give you the exact percentage. But certainly one of the effects is that we are seeing more demand for India-based resources where the rates are lower. So that would speak to the mix shift that you talked about. And then the other thing, as Ark has indicated and I mentioned as well, is the pricing environment still is -- it's somewhat challenging with in some cases concessions provided to existing customers and then with newer engagements also starting with a sharper pencil. And so you've got bolt impacts. And I think that you'll see them show up more so in Q4 and probably in the first half of 2024, which again is part of the discussion around what we see for profitability in coming quarters.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Understood. And that’s what you’re adjusting for them. Okay. I got it. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Please go ahead.
David Grossman: Thank you. Just wondering if I could just follow-up a couple of points that were just made in the last question. I guess I'm just trying to reconcile. You've given us a lot of good information about production about headwinds from customer losses, some of the larger customers that you've been talking about over the last several quarters and other dynamics. So I guess, I'm just trying to reconcile all of that, because I think Jason you said that when you back out FX and seasonal kind of workdays or work hours that it feels flattish. So it sounds like the newer work that's coming on is offsetting those headwinds. Is that a reasonable way to think about things as we kind of move into 2024? I know you don't want to give guidance, but does it feel like those headwinds that you've been experiencing in the last couple of quarters that have been driving sequential declines in revenues should pretty much abate by the end of this year.
Jason Peterson: Yes. Obviously, the world is a very complicated place at this time. And so I want to be careful not to make it an absolute assertion. But certainly, at this time, we are seeing more stability in customer programs and budgets. And so, particularly, as we look at North America, it does feel like we've achieved some degree of stability less of these unexpected sort of surprises and ramps down and we believe that we're seeing similar as we entered Q4. As I did mention in my prepared remarks, we do have a couple of customers in Europe who've already notified us and we've been aware of it for a little while that we'll see ramp downs there. But again, it feels right now that we're seeing less of these sort of unexpected surprises that drove both the mess in Q2 and has resulted in sequential declines. And so absolutely, if you adjusted out the build at impact, you'd have flat revenue as you go through Q3 to Q4.
David Grossman: And maybe a similar question on the margins in terms of – it looks like your utilization went down again sequentially. And you've got again the wage pricing dynamic which sounds like the timing may be extending into calendar 2024. So – and then you're factoring you've taken some cost-cutting actions. So when you roll up all those different elements, is it reasonable to think that you're still targeting your historical range as we go into 2024 that's kind of what the objective is based on the actions you've taken thus far in 2023?
Jason Peterson: So I think with some of the actions we're taking and some of the stabilization in demand, I think that you'll see better utilization in Q4 and we clearly hope to improve utilization in the first half of 2024. However, with the lower build days, you'll still have some compressed gross margin in Q4, which is why we've sort of guided the way we have with the 15% to 16%. What I do think as we enter 2024 is – there is still an imbalance between customer pricing and wage inflation. And as I think you've noted before David, we do expect to return to a more normalized variable compensation. And so I think as we enter 2024 – and we haven't done all the work on this yet. We don't quite know what wage pressures are going to be next year. And again, we're still trying to assess what happens with some of the deals we closed here in Q4, and how that will impact future pricing as we enter 2024. But the sense is that it's possible that we could see profitability decline somewhat as we move from 2023 to 2024. And then as I've been talking about over the last couple of earnings calls, we view 2024 as a transitional year where we get the opportunity to work through a few things. We expect at some point more rational sort of supply-demand and then that will give us opportunities on both pricing and with a return to more traditional profitability more likely in 2025.
David Grossman: Great. Thanks for that. Just one quick follow-up. So the kind of wage pricing dynamic, is that the biggest headwind to gross margins as we go into next year is just letting that play out.
Jason Peterson: Yes I would say that continues to be – that the wage pricing dynamic is the uncertain element, which is why it's harder for me to sort of comment on it right now but I will be able to do the next time we talk. But yes, I would say that the ongoing imbalance between sort of customer pricing and wage.
David Grossman: Got it. Great. Thanks very much. Appreciate that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Ramsey El-Assal: Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about booking conversion trends. And if you could just comment on things like how average portfolio duration is trending or time line to convert bookings to revenue or pipeline erosion trends? I'm just kind of curious are you seeing consistency and stability when it comes to conversion? Or is it more of a moving target still kind of in this tough environment?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it's still second. At the same time, if you're talking about lens of the relationship I think that's exactly what you said is that it's very much stabilizing. And we don't see the same kind of – that's a way different like versus Q1 situation and now, okay? I think it's much more manageable. I think much more transparency in situation.
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. Thank you. And a quick follow-up for me. I wanted to ask about – a follow-up on a prior question about the headcount numbers globally. And in particular, I'm just curious, the absolute headcount numbers in Ukraine and Belarus, should we think about those as relatively stable at this point? Or do you have plans to further draw down? I'm thinking particularly in Belarus, especially, given kind of the way Russia kind of ended this quarter officially. I'm just curious whether we should think about the absolute numbers as the sort of watermark that's going to be persistent or whether we could see more declines on an absolute basis in the region?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think the answer is very simple, right? We believe that Ukraine would be more stable and Belarus less stable just based on the situation of supply-demand ratio. And in absolute numbers and relative numbers Belarus declined during the last several years much, much, much more significantly than Ukraine. And I think this trend might be there depending on geopolitics and client reactions.
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Jason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. I just wanted to come back to some of the commentary around quarter-over-quarter growth rates. I know that's what you guys have been watching most closely just to assess demand and you've talked about the stabilization here. Just looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, do you think we get back to positive quarter-over-quarter revenue growth then? I think -- the Street is looking for about 3% growth. So I just wanted to get your take on that. I mean putting any potential moves in FX on the side given some of the stabilization in parts of the business do you think we're back in positive territory in the first quarter?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think you should expect our assets we will tell you this exactly in three months. But again, we've seen positivity right now, but we'll check in three months.
Jason Kupferberg: Right. Okay. And just a follow-up Jason on some of your margin commentary I want to make sure we've got the messaging right there because it sounds like most of the cost optimization is going to get reinvested. So it sounds like what you're suggesting is in 2024 non-GAAP margins or perhaps down versus 2023 and then 2025 you're kind of back to a "normal range" like 16% or 17%. Is that directionally the...
Jason Peterson: Yes. So we still -- we haven't worked through pricing. We haven't -- we're bubbled through what we think is going to happen from the wage environment I think in certain markets is pressures are not as pronounced but then there's other markets where there's very, very high cost of living inflation. And so what I'm saying is we haven't worked through it yet but I think it's certainly possible that you could see us talk about 2024 with lower profitability. And that was just in response to the question around do we think that we will maintain profitability in 2024? I just want to make certain that there is an indication that we could be lower as we enter the fiscal year and again working to get ourselves back into a position where we could operate in the 16% to 17% range in 2025.
Jason Kupferberg: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Please go ahead. 
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is Jessie on for Maggie. Thanks for taking our questions. So first how do you feel EPAM is performing compared to the market? Do you think that you're starting to take share?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we started to return to taking some share, okay? I think in existing clients, we stabilized while again there are some long-term -- like longer term policy some clients make and they have a plan that they will be executing according to the plan. As Jason mentioned that there are several clients in Europe which we know was going to happen. So on the other side in existing clients I think we stabilized and then some of the clients we started to take share back.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks, Ark. And then -- were you going to say something else?
Arkadiy Dobkin: No. That's good.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then for my follow-up Europe appeared to be a bright spot. But Jason you mentioned the incremental ramp downs there. Have you seen any changing behaviors or sentiment from clients in that geo? Or are there just some client-specific challenges that caused those ramp downs?
Jason Peterson: Yes. We saw Europe actually, declined somewhat sequentially between Q2 and Q3. And so we are seeing Europe, is a little bit more mixed but generally, it has been positive relative to North America. And then we've got a couple of these customers that we talked about. So, it's not what I would call broad-based, and I would call it more customer specific.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we are looking at this, almost year-to-year comparison becoming less meaningful, at this environment because there is no big change between these two years. So, right now, the quarter-by-quarter comparison really showing what's happened. And from this point, actually [indiscernible] 
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you, both
Jason Peterson: You’re welcome. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. 
Jamie Friedman: Hi, I had a slightly longer-term question Ark. I was wondering, how would you compare the relevance of -- and the mind share of some of the key services that you're known for especially application development? In terms of the tech stack is application development more or less meaningful relevant in today's technology architecture? How do you see that evolving if at all?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think this is -- we will try to predict obviously, future. And from this future point of view, I think the application development and build function, will become even more important with everything was happening. So it's very easy to optimize, yourself to in-time environment the whole point, and that would happen quarter from now or a couple of years from now. And from this point of view, we still believe that this is what started this conversation this morning and we still believe that application which we build and build function and strong capability would be extremely critical will all get stuck which is changing. We don't know where all this will be impacted, but even I mentioned multiple times. I do believe that there is a huge technical debt on within cloud environment in the world. And right now, it's taken kind of second priority in this environment, but it couldn't be done for too long because there are some companies which not in Western will be presenting their share. So, I think it will come back. And as we said what's happening with AI will be changing the whole application, infrastructure new opportunities will have to be rebuilt together. So that's why I think it's -- for us still probably as to how to maintain this advantage.
Jamie Friedman: Got it. Thanks for that. I’ll drop back in the queue give someone else the chance.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
James Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask quickly a couple of questions. First on pricing Jason you mentioned, a little bit of discounting et cetera. Can you help us think through kind of the longer-term implications? I know you've alluded to it in terms of, at some point, being able to recover that. But can you just help us think through what that mechanism typically would look like? And what would make sense over the medium to long run?
Jason Peterson: Yes. And this is one, we're probably using Ark's responsive with barrier or it depends is probably appropriate, but I'll just give you some conversions of it. Certainly, as you -- as people wanted to be more cost efficient India has been a more attractive play. We do think that India, will continue to be an important delivery location for us, but that you'll also see more demand over time in our other geographies. And so what you may see in the next couple of quarters is still a more pronounced mix of India delivery, but we don't think that that's necessarily permanent. At the same time from a pricing standpoint, oftentimes it does take probably a year to reset. And so, it's hard to kind of go demand is higher tomorrow and now your price is higher. Oftentimes, the relationships are sort of set over a year. And so that's why in some of the earlier calls I've said, I think you're going to enter 2024 with an environment that where it's difficult to take up price. And then, we'll probably end up somewhat locked in during 2024, okay, not in all clients and not in all roles. And then we've got more opportunity to adjust price probably later in the year. And of course, we'll be exposed to wage inflation during our traditional compensation campaign in Q2.
James Faucette: Great. I appreciate that Jason. Then my second question was just, how do you think about and this is for Ark and/or Jason obviously. But how do you think about any changes that you need to adjust to long term, if we're in a higher interest rate for longer environment. I guess, I'm just thinking that historically, EPAM has been really good at doing acquisitions and acquiring new technologies to stay at kind of leading edge. But with the cost of capital now being higher, do you have to adjust how you think about the importance and the role of acquisitions and future strategy and capability development? Thanks.
Jason Peterson: I think we would still continue with the same strategy that we've had with doing acquisitions that allow us to expand capabilities and then sort of help further our opportunity to grow organically. And so certainly, we'll be careful as we have been, but I think that you'll still see a significant focus on acquisitions that are probably more in that sort of small to midsized tuck-in.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And I guess, that's an advantage we have from our financial position. We have a very strong cash position to not rely on the outside market to do exactly what we were doing in the past, because it was relatively small acquisitions targeted for specific competencies or very specific geographies, we had a very good shape to continue doing this. I think that's not much change.
James Faucette: Great. I appreciate those commens.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Puneet Jain with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Puneet Jain: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on financial services. Some of your peers have talked about seeing some weakness there. And you also mentioned banking within financial services as weak. So can you double-click on what you are seeing there? Like are the headwinds broad-based within banking? Or are they client-specific?
Jason Peterson: Yeah. For us clearly we have one large client where it's probably client specific and we have seen some -- I guess, some reduction in revenues there. And then there's, a number of other banks that we would work with where we've also seen the decline. So I would say it's probably relatively broad for banking. But other elements of the financial services practices were also seeing growth. And -- so banking is certainly somewhat soft with opportunities in asset management and other areas in financial services including insurance.
Puneet Jain: That's correct. And then, like it was nice to hear that some of the programs some of the projects clients are coming back. Is that incremental work driven by clients need to modernize their core systems maybe because of generative AI? Or are these still more cost optimization type of deals?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think where the return happened. Usually it's a program with -- it's a program where suppliers [Indiscernible] because they can do it with somebody else. And that's usually the trigger for the return, but then it's actually triggering opening new opportunities with us as well. So we have already several situations during the last several quarters when it's happening. So Gen AI we talked about that we still see the direct impact on the revenue is not going to be exactly there yet, but there are a lot of activities and with all investments which we do in it right now have definitely differentiated our self we see the client reaction is what we should. So it's starting to create tangible opportunities working against the size of that but still relatively small. So I think we will see us going to be developing during the next quarters or so.
Puneet Jain: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Dobkin, CEO and President for any closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. Thank you for joining today. So I think with all kind of numbers which we said and we still looking more positive to the situation that several quarters ago. Unfortunately, the world is still continues to be a very unpredictable place. And that's why it's difficult to make more clear statement sometimes. So let's meet in three months and see what we will be able to share then. Thank you very much.
Operator: That will conclude today's call. We thank you all for joining. You may now …

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-03 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the EPAM Systems Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. And I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
David Straube: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. By now you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company’s second quarter 2023 results. If you have not, the copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today’s call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. I’d like to remind those listening that some of our comments made on today’s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company’s earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the results of our second quarter, I would like to spend a few minutes on the mid-quarter update we provided in June. As I said in my prepared remarks, the broader concerns over the economy led to a shift in demand dynamics for our sector. So we found the shift has been much more pronounced due to the geopolitical impact on our delivery centers and our focus on the build and digital product engineering segments of the market, which represents about 80%, 85% of our engagement in the first quarter. This was especially evident in the technology vertical, which continues to be impacted by the pull-back in spend after years of strong investments in digital and product development efforts, while being spread broader across other industry segments as well. Over the last quarters, we have also seen this impact in some of our largest clients, as they have held back for the direct spending from new build programs to the economic conditions and caution in their businesses. This factor has contributed to a high percentage of our shortfall over the first half of 2023. Now I will switch to Q3 and the rest of 2023. While we are starting to see a few encouraging signs, we will share more on that in a minute. Today, I would state that we expect still based on the current level of unpredictability, a negative dynamic to continue into the second half of 2023, but at the lower level than we saw in the first half of this year. With that, I would like to state that while we do understand that this is a difficult period for us and for those sector more broadly, based on insight from the past several years and past several quarters especially, we are turning that experience into pragmatic action plan, which we will be applying to our business throughout the remainder of this year and further into the future and consider this time an opportunity, which, as we all know, when new crisis presents to transforming ourselves. Some of our current plans and actions are focusing on making real-time adjustment to our savings, go-to-market plan, customer engagement programs and global delivery talent platform stabilization. These key investments help us to prepare ourselves for strong rebound position. What is important also to note is that our primary focus on digital product and data engineering services combined with digital consulting, agency, design, content and digital marketing services, a real win-win. In other words, the primary services and market segments, which allow us to double company in the previous three years are staying intact, while we continue to tune our capabilities in line with the global market demands. Our point is simple, the entire IT sector is undergoing what we believe is an evolution of the services market moving from the core IT to digitalization, even more broadly and with significant acceleration. And to consider new digitally nascent businesses faster to reinvent entire models and ways of working and now is the promise of generative AI capabilities empowerment as the core. We have been at the forefront of similar trends before, and once again, are looking to put EPAM as a center of new wave of transformative services. We fully expect as a result to be underpinned and even more driven exactly by our traditionally strong product platform engineering, data analytics and machine-learning capabilities, but now, in combination with what generative AI promises. So our thesis has been and continues to be that our core services profile will benefit in the medium and longer term from EPAM higher concentration on cloud data and engineering. And we will capitalize strongly on our core capabilities once the general situation in our segment rebounds. The AI impact will become even more real in terms of complexity to future applications and platforms by encapsulating not just currently available elements of gen AI and a very visible needs for trust, reliability and security management of AI, but also by close integration with new classes of composite and adaptive AI platforms, as well as these foundational models in specific industry cloud platforms. In short, we are optimistic about the transformation -- transformative opportunities to the core application stack coming from AI-led transformation, which is also well illustrated by our latest announcements. That is one of the key areas of our investments. The second critical part is a further diversification and stabilization of our global delivery platform, including the allocation of our talent more optimally across the world, while at the same time enabling our strong engineering quality standards across all EPAM locations. This rebalancing effort will be performed over the next three quarters to four quarters, in part to drive higher levels of gross margin performance. Our other plans and actions today are focused on our immediate demand generation and new logo acquisitions. During the first half of 2023, and specifically in Q2, we drove new logo activity at high levels than when compared to 2021 and 2022. We see this as a positive sign of our return to demand. We should accelerate the recovery and allow us to return to grow as soon as the current client base stabilizes. A few example for our new Q2 clients include; one of the world’s leading B2B travel platforms, a large European-based multi-national resilient marketplace, organizing for trading of shares and other securities; a multi-billion dollar molecular diagnostic company specialized in detection of early-stage cancers; a leading global insurance provider of financial protection, absence management and supplemental sales benefits solutions; and global infrastructure services companies in the energy space. In these new programs, we are starting to include a more diverse stack of our capabilities from consulting to different types of implementation efforts. Some of those clients we expect will support our next growth journey. In addition, we also see some programs with existing clients who have started ramping-up. Recently, Canadian Tire announced a seven-year strategic partnership with Microsoft to accelerate their modernization and drive retail innovation across their Canadian markets. Leveraging our decade long relationship with Canadian Tires, EPAM will be a trusted and proven engineering partner in digital system integrator to lead there. So there are some signs indeed that the overall demand environment is coming to more normal terms for us. We probably will be able to share more next quarter of how strong those signs are going to be. But in anyway, it also confirms that EPAM continues to remain very relevant and competitive, even in current market of low demand for the build function, which is a good entry point to share some of our go-to-market progress, especially in relationship with hyperscalers. In June, we announced a global strategic partnership with Google Cloud across our global markets, cloud solutions and focusing on specific efforts in our larger verticals, including financial services, consumer to economy and entertainment, healthcare, life sciences, energy and Hi-tech to help our customers to modernize and transform their businesses. We are also encouraged and energized by the momentum we are seeing with our other major cloud partners, Microsoft and AWS. More to come on this direction very soon. But just as a preview, you might have seen that we were recently made Microsoft’s Great Partner of the Year for 2023 with couple other venerable recognitions with Microsoft Partner Network. In, overall, we made very strong progress in establishing a real 360-degree relationship with all three major players and plan to be sharing more over the course of the next few weeks publicly. Two final points. First, I just want to reiterate our view that there is a tremendous amount of work to be done in continued modernization, application development and integration, and in considering and designing the models and strategies for business change. Our commitment to our expanding capabilities and engineering consulting can now work to create a next-generation agency will help us to compete and win a new demand climate once customers gain confidence observing optimization initiatives and return their retention to growth. Second, I wanted to touch on AI one more time. As it is obviously on everyone’s mind these days. So how do we see its impact to our business and more critically to our customers and the industry at large? And of course, what are you doing to position EPAM for long-term success? EPAM has a long history of investing in R&D and our call to action over the years has been to make the promises of technology real. So rather than sharing any specific dollar amount we plan to spend on AI, which is very difficult to estimate with the current speed of change. We can instead share how we are thinking about directional investments today. Currently, we pick investments with two principles in mind. Whatever you do have to be pragmatic to EPAM in terms of relevancy and deliverability for our clients; and second, it has to be responsible and cost-effective. This translates to two broad categories of things we are working on and you probably already saw some of this being announced. We are building accelerators in IT that help orchestrate full transformation program using the best available capabilities of large language models and related from works and tools. A significant portion of this is the work we are doing to change how we -- ourselves work from how we build growth to how we position and operate our company. We are working across thousands of use cases to focus, first of all, on responsible, and very importantly, cost-effective solutions. Otherwise, future real progress will be difficult. To do so, we are focused on expanding our partnership, including with cloud providers and leading research centers to ensure those critical aspects and also focus ourselves on aligning internally across consulting and experience in technology to address that. The reality is that the production ready AI services application landscape is still very much at the entry stage of maturity today. While we see it is a very large and accelerating opportunity for us, specifically in our primary market segment. We are currently focusing on all type of activities to learn and experiment more from proof-of-concepts to real scale pilots and some scaled production initiatives. So just like advances to our cloud over a decade ago, drove demand for advanced engineering, next-generation architecture and hybrid and derivative delivery models, we are confident that this wave of AI-led requirements will drive more demand for advanced data engineering in cloud computing, content creation and the artificial intelligence native application, as well as the new UX and UI paradigms. Our clients, who themselves make up a significant segment of technology companies in technology-led enterprises are in the mindset of already started to aim arms race, which we should believe will be a real engine for the future growth. Some of that, we are already starting to see within our demand pipeline. With that, I would like to pass to Jason to share more details and numbers for Q2 and for an update for our business outlook for the remainder of 2023.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. Before covering our Q2 results, I wanted to remind you that in addition to our customary non-GAAP adjustments, expenditures resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including EPAM’s humanitarian commitment to Ukraine, business continuity resources and accelerated employee relocations have been excluded from non-GAAP financial results. We have included additional disclosures specific to these and other related items in our Q2 earnings release. In the second quarter, EPAM generated revenue of $1.17 billion, a year-over-year decrease of 2.1% on a reported basis and a decrease of 2.4% in constant currency terms, reflecting a favorable foreign exchange impact of 30 basis points. Revenue in the quarter was impacted by reductions in program spending across a number of our clients, as well as ongoing client caution related to new project starts. The reduction in Russian customer revenues resulting from our decision to exit the market had 100-basis-point negative impact on year-over-year revenue growth. Excluding the Russia revenues, year-over-year revenue for reported and constant currency would have decreased by 1.1% and 1.7%, respectively. Beginning with our industry verticals. On a year-over-year basis, travel and consumer declined 1%, primarily due to declines in retail, partially offset by solid growth in travel and hospitality. Financial services grew 3.2%, with growth coming from asset management and insurance services. Business information and media decreased 4.1% in the quarter. Revenue in the quarter was impacted by a reduction in spend at a number of large clients based on uncertainty in their end markets, particularly in the mortgage data space. Software and Hi-tech contracted 10.3%. The decline in the quarter reflected a reduction in revenue from the former top 20 customer we mentioned during our previous earnings call and generally slower growth in revenue across a range of customers in the vertical. Life Sciences and Healthcare declined 10.9%. Revenue in the quarter was impacted by the ramp down of a large transformational program mentioned during our previous earnings calls. On a sequential basis, growth in Life Sciences and Healthcare actually was a positive 2.9%, driven by new work at both existing and new logos. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered solid growth of 8.6%, driven by clients in energy, manufacturing and automotive. From a geographic perspective, Americas, our largest region representing 58% of Q2 revenues, declined 5.9% year-over-year or 5.7% in constant currency. The growth rate in the quarter was impacted in part by the ramp down of life sciences and healthcare customer we mentioned during our previous earnings call. EMEA, representing 39% of our Q2 revenues grew 8.5% year-over-year or 6.5% in constant currency. CEE represented 1% of our Q2 revenues contracted 61.1% year-over-year or 45.8% in constant currency. Revenue in the quarter was impacted by our decision to exit our Russia operations and the resulting ramp-down in services to Russia customers. And finally, APAC declined 19.7% year-over-year or 18.6% in constant currency terms and now represents 2% of our revenues. Revenue in the quarter was impacted primarily by the ramp-down of work within our financial services vertical. In Q2, revenues from our top 20 customers declined 2.4% year-over-year, while revenues from clients outside our top 20 declined 1.9%. Moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 30.9%, compared to 29.2% in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 32.6%, compared to 31.5% for the same quarter last year. Gross margin in Q2 2023 reflects a lower level of variable compensation expense, partially offset by the negative impact of lower utilization. GAAP SG&A was 16.7% of revenue, compared to 19.5% in Q2 of last year. SG&A in Q2 2022 included a more significant level of expenses resulting from Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. Non-GAAP SG&A in Q2 2023 came in at 14.8% of revenue, compared to 15.2% in the same period last year. Reductions in both cost of revenue and SG&A during the quarter reflect the company’s ongoing focus on managing its cost base, as well as reduced variable compensation expense due to the lower level of financial performance expected for the year. In Q2, EPAM incurred $5 million in severance-related expense included in both GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A, as the company works to better align its cost structure with the current demand environment. GAAP income from operations was $144 million or 12.3% of revenue in the quarter, compared to $93 million or 7.8% of revenue in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $191 million or 16.3% of revenue in the quarter, compared to $177 million or 14.9% of revenue in Q2 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 20%. Non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.3%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $2.03. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.64, reflecting a $0.26 increase compared to the same quarter in 2022. In Q2, there were approximately 59.2 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q2 was $89 million, compared to $78 million in the same quarter of 2022. Free cash flow was $82 million, compared to free cash flow of $59 million in the same quarter last year. At the end of Q2, DSO was 71 days and compares to 69 days for Q1 2023 and 71 days for the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, we expect DSO will remain steady throughout 2023. Share repurchases in the second quarter were approximately 195,000 shares for $41.4 million at an average price of $212.77 per share. As of June 30th, we had approximately $450 million of share repurchase authority remaining. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended Q2 with more than 49,350 consultants, designers, engineers, trainers and architects. Production headcount declined 10% compared to Q2 2022, the result of lower levels of hiring, combined with voluntary and involuntary attrition as we continue to balance supply and demand. Our total headcount for the quarter was more than 55,600 employees. Utilization was 75.1%, compared to 78% in Q2 of last year and 74.9% in Q1 2023. Now let’s turn to our business outlook. As Ark mentioned, we have seen a higher level of new logo acquisitions and revenue from our focused efforts on demand generation. While this progress is encouraging, the level of revenue generated is not enough to offset further expected reductions in client budgets, ramp-downs and delays in new program starts. With the range of outcomes, we outlined on our June 5th call, we are maintaining our expectations for a muted demand environment, with sequential decline in Q3 and further sequential or flat revenue growth in Q4. Our Ukrainian delivery organization continues to operate efficiently and our teams remain highly focused on maintaining uninterrupted production. Our guidance assumes that we will continue to be able to deliver from Ukraine in productivity levels at or somewhat lower than those achieved in 2022. Consistent with previous cycles, we will continue to thoughtfully calibrate our expense levels, while investing in our capabilities and focusing on the preservation of our talent in preparation for a return to higher levels of demand. We expect headcount will continue to decline modestly in Q3 due to limited hiring and more typical attrition and we will continue to limit hiring until we see improving demand. We expect utilization to decline slightly in the second half of the year, primarily driven by a higher level of expected vacations. Lastly, at the end of July, we completed the sale of our Russian business, which will result in a decline in Russian revenues from Q2 to Q3. But we will also recognize an estimated loss on sale of $18.4 million, which will impact our Q3 and full year GAAP results. Additionally, this will drive a further modest reduction in headcount. Moving on to our full year outlook. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $4.65 billion to $4.70 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of approximately 3%. On an organic constant currency basis, excluding the impact of the exit in Russia, we expect revenue decline to also be approximately 3%, both at the midpoint of the range. We expect GAAP income from operations to now be in the range of 10.5% to 11.5%, which includes the loss associated with the sale of our Russian business. The non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 15% to 16%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to continue to be approximately 22%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation is expected to continue to be 23%. For earnings per share, we expect that GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7 to $7.20 for the full year and non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $9.90 to $10.10 for the full year. We now expect weighted average share count of 59.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Moving to our Q3 2023 outlook. We expect revenues to be in the range of $1.14 billion to $1.15 billion, producing a year-over-year decline of 6% to 7%. On an organic constant currency basis, excluding the impact of the exit in Russia, we expect revenue to decline by 8.5% to 9.5%. For the third quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 10% to 11% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation to be approximately 23%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.62 to $1.70 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.52 to $2.60 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59.1 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements in the third quarter and the remainder of the year. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $39 million for each of the remaining quarters. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $5.5 million for each of the remaining quarters. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be a $1.5 million gain for each of the remaining quarters. Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $11.7 million for Q3 and $9.3 million for Q4. We expect excess tax benefits to be around $2.7 million for Q3 and $1.8 million for Q4. In addition to these customer GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments and consistent with the prior quarters in 2023, we expect to have ongoing non-GAAP adjustments in 2023 resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Please see our Q2 earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP guidance. Finally, one more assumption outside of our GAAP to non-GAAP items. With our significant cash position, we are now generating a healthy level of interest income and are now expecting interest and other income to be $11.7 million for each of the remaining quarters. Lastly, I’d like to thank our employees for their continued dedication and focus on our customers. Operator, let’s open the call up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Bryan Bergin of TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Bryan Bergin: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thank you. I wanted to just kick off with large client visibility, and I guess, existing base stability. Can you talk about the conversations you are having among your top 10 or top 20 clients? Are you getting closer to stability in this space, and I am curious, just as we look at the implied sequential decline in 3Q and perhaps 4Q, just trying to understand the attribution to the decline among the large clients still in that base versus the intake of new work coming in at lower dollar levels versus like conversion delays and slower ramps of work?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Hello. Good morning. I think visibility or predictability is probably better than it was a couple of quarters ago. So and we can plan better. But there is still a slowdown which started a couple of quarters ago and we are working with it. And there is also some asynchronous points between clients when they were making some of the decisions. So, there is elements of unknown still there. But again, in general, we feel it is much more stable. We also see in top 20 that some clients starting to return in discussion about growth. Again, it’s difficult to comment when exactly it happened. But we see some signs that they tried some additional vendors who were not satisfied coming back to us with discussions. So, I think, in general, feeling about Ukraine, despite of situations that would get deliberately more active period still from the client perspective, but from expectation of the stability from work conditions, taking in account during the last 18 months, we didn’t have particularly one unproductive day. So, people believe that the clients starting to feel the link, why don’t this [ph] -- for those who continue that. So, I think, in general, more stable, still unknown and there is still slowdown going a little bit. So we hope that it will be start like in the next couple of quarters.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. And a follow-up just on the workforce diversification, can you give us a sense on how the current operating footprint is comprised as of the close of the June quarter, just roughly a mix between billable in Ukraine, Belarus versus Central Europe versus LatAm and APAC? Thanks.
Jason Peterson: Yeah. So we are under 30% from a CIS region. So that’s primarily, as you indicated, Ukraine and Belarus. We are continuing to see maybe a little bit of growth in India. So that continues to be a significant delivery location for us. And right now, while we are working through demand, probably, we see some stabilization in Latin America, but again, continues to be a significant part of our expected current and future delivery footprint.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Tyler DuPont: Hi. Good morning, Ark and Jason. This is Tyler DuPont on for Jason. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start by asking about operating margins. During the quarter, they have seen some pretty strong, 130 bps greater than the top end of the guidance range. Can you just spend a minute or two parsing out sort of what led to that outperformance and sort of how you are thinking about margins through the back half of the year, where there is any sort of incremental investment opportunities available, or any color there?
Jason Peterson: Yeah. So, clearly, with the demand environment that we are seeing, we are trying to make certain that we are cautious about spending, while still making certain that we are making investments in sales channels and partner programs, and clearly, our AI capabilities that would allow us to return to significant growth in the future. But we are focused clearly on SG&A and you are seeing efficiency there. And then, you are also -- some caution around what we are doing with headcount, and generally, what you are seeing is it’s a little bit of tuning in different delivery locations and lower hiring, very modest hiring, which is then offset by attrition and has resulted in these net reductions in headcount. The other piece and we did talk about it I think in the script, is -- there is a variable compensation element. It’s funded by performance versus our expectations for the full year. With the change in expectations for the full year, we did adjust the expected expense related to variable compensation. That shows up as some benefit in Q2 and we will have lesser, but some benefit in the remainder of the year. And then, again, we were just sort of toppish from a revenue standpoint with the $1.170 billion in Q2. From a profitability standpoint, generally, Q3 is a good quarter for us with more bill days. I don’t -- I think you are still going to see somewhat lower utilization in Q3 and so probably not expecting much improvement or probably maybe even a little bit of decline if you went to the midpoint of the range, the 15.5% to 16.5% that we have guided to for the Q3. I think gross margins could end up in a 32% to 33% range in Q3 with lower bill days in Q4, may be somewhat lower and I would definitely expect to see a decline in profitability between Q3 and Q4, due to a lower number of bill days, vacations and all of that, which generally impacts profitability in the last quarter of the year.
Tyler DuPont: Okay. Great. I appreciate that, Jason. Thanks. And then for my follow-up, I just wanted to sort of double click on the demand story here as we look towards the back half of the year, specifically your expectations on the evolution of the demand environment across your total client base, the balance between if you are assuming macro stability or any sort of additional softness in any of the verticals or geographies you are operating in? I know Bryan sort of alluded to the sequential declines and the last question in regard to 3Q and potentially 4Q. So just sort of any clarity there helping us frame the demand environment would be appreciated?
Jason Peterson: So just -- I am going to give you the numbers, what we are currently seeing from a forecast standpoint for Q3 and then I will let Ark comment and maybe provide more color. From a sequential standpoint, I think, with some of the budget reductions that you have seen in major customers, you are likely to continue to see sequential decline across a fairly large number of our verticals. I think you could see sequential growth in the emerging, which has got a significant energy manufacturing footprint. I think you could continue to see -- are likely to see a sequential growth in the healthcare and life sciences, where we are making good traction here in fiscal year 2023. So that’s kind of what I am seeing from that standpoint. I think you still have a little bit of impact from customer decisions to reduce spend in Q2. And I think as Ark has indicated, that we are more hopeful that clients are beginning to sort of stabilize their spend and could even see some increase later in the year, but.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yeah. I think that’s right with what I shared at the beginning of the first question. It’s still soft. It’s still unpredictable. It’s still slightly going down. At the same time, we see different conversations starting to happen. There are more activities with new logos and that’s what we shared during our thought at the beginning. But also existing clients, different sort of conversations that we saw a couple of months, a couple of quarters ago. Again, it’s still difficult to predict, we reacted and we forecasted based on what we really kind of see right now.
Tyler DuPont: Great. Thank you, both.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. The next question will come from David Grossman of Stifel. Your line is open.
David Grossman: Thank you. Good morning. I wonder if I could just -- a couple of quick follow-ups to some of the questions that have been asked. I mean, the first is just getting back to the customer dynamics and their own desire to kind of diversify risk geographically. If things stabilize from here, when would the sequential revenue headwinds begin to diminish if things just stabilized from here going forward?
Jason Peterson: Yeah. Yes. So, clearly, we would expect a sequential decline in Q2 to Q3, so when would the sequential stabilize. And then, David, I think, you are aware of this Q3 to Q4 is just you have got to bill day impact and so you have to have an improvement in demand to stay flat Q3 to Q4. And so we think that, that’s possible as we talked about in the guidance or maybe you could see a little bit of growth Q3 to Q4. But you do have -- you are walking uphill Q3 to Q4 with the lower bill days.
David Grossman: Right. So excluding…
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yeah, David. Yeah. Go ahead.
David Grossman: No. I just wanted to clarify, so excluding seasonality, right? If things stabilize from here, things would be flattish sequentially, right, excluding the seasonal dynamic.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think earlier what I would commented, in June when we talked last time and in May kind of when we were clearly felt that situation worse than we expected before. We said that we are thinking about two quarters, three quarters, four quarters. And I think that’s the feeling which we still have today, okay? Because it’s very difficult to predict like you are asking when. So I do believe that within this timeframe, we will probably will get to the situation when sequential -- quarterly sequential growth will start to recover. But we clearly -- we will be updating this quarter-after-quarter. So we definitely see it slow down. We are definitely seeing different signs from the clients. But again, some clients when they made some decisions, they within themselves have some type of inertia, which would take some time. All market will be very clearly changed or less satisfaction with some other matters will be not as high, okay? Some of this has started to feel, that’s what given us some level of opportunities. But I don’t think we can say anything more than another two some level, three quarters from now, maybe four some level.
David Grossman: Got it. All right. Thanks. I appreciate that. And then just back to your own internal efforts to geographically diversify. And without getting too far into the details, are there some high level dashboard items that you can share that would provide some insight into recruiting kind of yield utilization, attrition? Anything that would give us a sense of kind of how these new geographies are ramping?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. You are asking about what we feel about our progress with diversifying like our global delivery, is this...
David Grossman: Correct.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay.
David Grossman: Correct.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. So, I think, we are actually pretty much satisfied with the progress. I think our efforts in India and Latin America definitely starting to pay out. India, right now the second largest location we have built and that was part of the lab, which we started in May 2022, where we at least all of you had said, [inaudible] what we are planning to do. So right now, Ukraine and Belarus production together, it’s more like 25%, 26% for the total capacity. Where India -- Latin America caveat, probably, by the end of the year, it will be closer to 18%, 20%. The quality and the effort which we put in there are definitely improving. We also have very specific programs how to share knowledge between people who stay and depart for a long time and how to raise the bar with improvement and operations. I think we still committed very much to Ukraine. We do believe that it will be growth there. Yes, we don’t know when, but maybe we will be very much aligned with the sequential growth, which we are expecting in two quarters, three quarters, four quarters coming back. So besides India and Latin America, which is more traditional, we have actually Central Western Asia, which is interesting, because it’s, I call it, a significant number of people who knows how well it could be located during the last 18 months. So, we have very interesting ways and we have potentially a very good demographics for the growth of the target in these countries and clients started to experience this and getting comfortable. And again, with the demand coming back, I think, it will be a good opportunity for us. And finally, more traditional fast location, Central Eastern Europe, mostly inside of EU, sometimes outside of EU, what, Hungary, Poland, this is very quality -- high quality engineering location for us. Clients very comfortable there. In good demand environment, it’s always very high demand. So it’s also becoming stronger because good level of talents located from our traditional data centers. So I think we go in actually to the direction of building probably the most balanced global delivery platform. And as soon as the rebound will be started, we will feel comfortable to grow. One of the important things and we mentioned this, we very carefully kind of balance in the cost structure is because in all of the sectors which I outlined, there are different cost structures and we are going back to improve our gross margins by reallocating focuses across these locations. So if it’s a short question, we will be able to provide quality which clients expected from us, it’s simply kind of recent clients, but it’s actually very much minimum.
David Grossman: Got it. Thanks very much. Really appreciate that color.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And one moment please for our next question. The next question will come from Maggie Nolan of William Blair. Your line is open.
Maggie Nolan: Hi. Thank you. Just to follow-up on that last question and your last comment there, Ark, around the margins. Can you give us a little bit of a preliminary thought on what all of this might mean for gross margins into 2024, when we might see things kind of start to pick up and to what magnitude?
Jason Peterson: Yeah. I think I will step in. And we are probably not quite ready to talk about the 2024 in terms of, let’s say, specifics or even ranges. But Ark explained, as we moved into the different delivery locations, obviously, we did so quickly. In some cases, we probably have a little bit more balance in the higher cost geographies, including traditional kind of on-site markets. We would look to kind of rebalance that somewhat. And then the other thing as we have talked about over the last couple of quarters is that, as we move into new geographies, and particularly, as we sort of either relocated or stood up new geographies quickly, we ended up with a somewhat more sort of senior delivery organization and delivery pyramid and we are working to begin to introduce more juniors later in the year that would then give us a more balanced pyramid and therefore also improve margins. And so that, obviously, combined with utilization improvement, would be the things that we are looking to do to sort of stabilize and improve gross margins over time
Maggie Nolan: Okay. Thank you. And then on the new logo additions, it was good to hear the progress on that this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the ability to keep the sales force intact during all this transformation and then any kind of patterns that you are seeing on those new logos in terms of the time it’s taking for them to convert to revenue?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, I think, I will comment on new logo and new business is kind of illustrated that while sales force is also some dynamics. So I think, directionally, it’s working through positively right now. I think after our comments like several quarters ago, when we were in the middle of all these allocations points and we have to deal with thousands of people, so it will slow down. Right now, it’s all coming…
Jason Peterson: Yeah. So very much actively focused on external opportunities and much of the internal things that we had to manage over the last, say, four quarters are substantially behind us and there’s a focus with both the account teams, the sales force and the executives on driving incremental growth.
Maggie Nolan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Your line is open.
Ramsey El-Assal: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up with your mentioning kind of tighter integrations and partnerships with the hyperscalers. Can you talk about the strategy, how these relationships might act or expand your capabilities or your addressable market, and then also just comment on whether this is part of positioning EPAM for growth once the demand environment picks up again?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yeah. I think it’s dynamic also in general because of the market change in comparison like during a year ago. And now we are talking about much closer relationship from both point of view, because we definitely, like everybody else, focusing on client’s perspective where hyperscalers can open additional doors and all competitors doing the same and this is kind of nothing new. On another side, the partner should become stronger because just migration to the cloud is kind of as is business becoming not so interesting as usually. It means very complex modernization efforts and this is where strength of EPAM come in from. This is why the partnership with hyperscalers become more important, not only for us, but for them as well, because EPAM has a reputation, which actually can do complex modernization -- complex innovation. That’s what we mentioned based on the status of partner of the year in this category with Microsoft. That’s exactly a confirmation on this. And as we mentioned, we will be following this some announcement during the next couple of weeks, which will be confirming improved partnership levels, specifically because of our ability to deliver complexity. And it’s definitely a very good preparation from our point of view for rebound, because when demand will be back, everything which wasn’t finished, and it’s a lot, in all categories, in cloud and data modernization projects add huge pressure on demand for data engineering because of the AI components. So the hyperscalers relationship will be very critical.
Ramsey El-Assal: All right. Thank you. And a follow-up for me. Can you contrast the demand environment in Europe versus North America? It looks like the growth rates are different in those geographies, although admittedly, they don’t -- necessarily have not tabulated the constant currency number. But is it a different environment you are seeing in different geographies or is it very similar trends across the business regardless of geography?
Jason Peterson: Yeah. So, certainly, some of what happened in Europe is due to foreign exchange. But what we are seeing is that some of the larger kind of budget reductions and conservatism is actually showing up more in North American clients. Think about the couple of clients we have talked about in healthcare and tech. Those were both North American clients. We have seen less of these types of reductions in spend in Europe. At the same time, we have got some pretty good traction also even in the consumer and retail side in Europe. And so, yes, there does seem to be a bit of a divergence, but we will see what happens as we work through the remainder of the year.
Ramsey El-Assal: Fantastic. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: In general, it’s still benefitting, but it is still, all I assume [ph], what we are talking about several specific client situations. Mostly it’s happened in…
Jason Peterson: North America.
Arkadiy Dobkin: …in North America and those situations were independent from general economic environment.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from Moshe Katri of Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.
Moshe Katri: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. A couple of follow-ups here. So do you -- looking at the new logos, can you confirm that you are actually getting the same bill rates as you are selling via some of the other delivery centers, including India, as you have been getting in Eastern Europe? So are we talking about comparable billability?
Jason Peterson: So what we usually talk about is an environment where potentially you can get higher bill rates with new engagements. That’s probably less likely to occur in today’s demand environment. And generally, Moshe, if you are trying to get it just kind of what happens as you deliver more out of India. India does have somewhat lower price points than some of the geographies in Eastern Europe, maybe not significantly different than a few of the geographies in Southwest, in Western Asia or Soviet Central Asia. But we get somewhat lower price points than certainly sort of Central Europe.
Moshe Katri: Okay. So would you say that the new logos that are coming on board are more dilutive to margins versus what you were accustomed to or is there any way to mitigate that?
Jason Peterson: Yeah. So if you -- you can have different bill rates in different geographies and still have the same margin percent, right? You have got different cost structures, you got different cost of benefits and that type of thing. And so lower price, or higher price even, doesn’t necessarily mean lower or higher margin, again -- so I would say, yes, we can kind of mitigate, and no, I don’t expect that new business is being attained in super expressive margins. We are working to kind of sharpen our pencils but be appropriate in our pricing.
Moshe Katri: All right. That makes sense. And last…
Jason Peterson: Absolutely.
Moshe Katri: Sorry. Last one here. So we visited your center in Hyderabad. And I remember, you have a significant capacity to kind of expand there. Can you talk a bit about your future plans in terms of how important India or critical India is going to be able to continue to get those new logos onboard and actually to be able to accelerate growth down the road? Thanks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yeah. Still, I know like we answered it a little bit in grey area. But in general, you need to understand the current market environment is not what it was and everybody knows it like 18 months ago or two years ago. The whole rate structure for everyone, not only for us, is different for new deals as well. So the other things which could change it is actually the demand turning into more normal scale and the demand for complexity for build stuff will go up, then correction will be happening in other side. So, there is nothing magical here. So the new deals coming today is very different environment if it was, again, 18 months, 24 months ago. It’s number one. Number two about India, now I don’t know when you visited. I don’t remember when we visited Hyderabad, but right now, we have five development centers. We -- Hyderabad is still -- is the biggest one, but we have two others, which are growing very strongly and a few others which we started recently to growing strongly as well. So that’s definitely an important part of our future, but it’s one of the parts. It’s not like we are going to switch completely. That’s what I mentioned before. We are really looking how to build very balanced global delivery network for EPAM.
Moshe Katri: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question will come from Puneet Jain of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Puneet Jain: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I also wanted to ask about demand. Do you expect like clients to spend on CapEx investments to modernize or re-platform their core systems sometime this year, maybe in 4Q or is that type of work is something that could come through on their next year’s budget, meaning that it might not come in anytime this year?
Jason Peterson: Do you expect to see modernization and spend occurring in Q4 or more likely to see a return to budget growth in the first half of 2024?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It’s difficult to answer that. I think we answered this question already in another way a couple of times. We don’t know right now. There is not so much visibility. That’s difficult. Some of them, who knows, it’s sometimes unexpected happening in Q4 will be the quarter when clients will really start spending. But let’s see, so.
Puneet Jain: Got it. And are you seeing any pricing pressure on like-to-like basis?
Jason Peterson: The pricing pressure on a like-for-like basis, so I think Ark obviously picked it up in a more pronounced way than I did earlier. So this is definitely an environment where you need to sharpen your pencil. And so really, we are being thoughtful, but it is in an environment where clients are particularly cost sensitive and that is showing up in pricing. And to Moshe’s question earlier, is that traditionally in certain newer engagements, it’s an opportunity to sort of improve price and that’s less the case in this fiscal year.
Puneet Jain: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And one moment please for our next question. Next question will come from Arvind Ramnani of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Arvind Ramnani: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about your new clients. Are they coming from specific industries and geos or maybe are you able to provide some color on the nature of work on your new clients?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think at this specific time, again, there are some industries like, let’s say, oil and gas, which is in pretty good shape, okay? But this is more an exception today. The rest of the new clients, in our view, happens from two kind of categories. Some clients who actually try to utilize this time as an opportunity and decided to go and invest instead of like and get some competitive advantage and that’s exactly what you recall before say, as soon as these type of clients will demonstrate some results, it will trigger a faster recovery of the market for build and kind of transformative programs, okay? And the second category, I think, it’s a client which is, at this point, not trying just to do transformative programs, but trying to utilize this time to build relations with stronger vendors for the future return and be prepared for this. Because, in our view, demand for talent when market will rebound will be very, very strong with everything what’s happening right now in technology, in technical debt and since which we have not done or not finished and with everything was triggered by, it seems like everybody is trying to talk about generative AI on the operations, but it’s still there and it will change actually the landscape. So that will put pressure on the talent demand as well. Well, a lot of people speculation that it would replace companies like EPAM very soon [ph], okay.
Arvind Ramnani: Yeah. That’s helpful. And I mean, I know typically, when you start your client relationships, they start small and then they kind of ramp over time. Is that kind of a similar dynamic that you have with these new clients?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So there are a few example on -- we kind of give, I think, five, six examples across different vendors. There are few of them, which is pretty large and that’s why we mentioned that it might be that they will be driving our growth to the next years. There are some of them, which is more framework contracts, which we won and just started and there is a specific place how it’s happening. So it might start to bring results like closer to the end of the year, maybe beginning of the next year, visible results. And there are some which is very, very specific programs, but not big, but very interesting from the new technology standpoint. So it’s kind of a variety of this. If we will see better trends, that would mean that it’s actually the market change.
Arvind Ramnani: Perfect. And just last question from me. I just -- I did want to ask about Belarus. Can you share some sort of headcount trends and utilization in Belarus and are you also seeing any pushback with sort of your exposure to Belarus?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think I have answered for kind of Ukraine and Belarus here. I think with Ukraine clients who stayed with Ukraine are much more comfortable right now. We see some clients coming back. Again, it proves that nothing was happening from the quality of delivery or kind of impact on any production activities during the last 18 months, making clients more comfortable. Yes, it’s kind of new normal, but the normal is a key part of this. With Belarus, it’s a slowdown. We still have clients which operate there and we have some clients who are exiting there. So, Belarus is, from headcount point of view, kind of slightly faster than as of anything else.
Arvind Ramnani: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. I am seeing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the conference back to Arkadiy Dobkin for closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. I think we will update you in three months. But in general, that we get in with all unpredictability, we feel a little bit more stable and predictable than the quarter ago. So thank you very much and talk to you in three months.
Operator: This conclude today’s conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-05 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the EPAM Systems First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
David Straube: Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter 2023 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind those listening that some of our comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measure and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website. With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin : Thank you, David. Thank you for joining us today. Three months ago, we shared some details of what we are thinking about 2023 and how we saw the main factors and trends driving our performance during the year. As you will recall, we anticipated some level of market slowdown in general demand, but we are not certain of the impact level of this slowdown in our own portfolio yet. We also saw that some of our customers were mitigated the risk exposure due to the war in Ukraine and we are showing signs of managing those risk by [indiscernible] and work streams to some other partners. With the understanding of all of that, we were proactively investing in building scalable quality delivery locations outside of our traditional comfort zone to consistently delivering comparable engineering quality across all of our growing global delivery markets. And we also said that we were expecting to continuously optimize operations across our global delivery locations to bring the cost structure back to our traditional metrics in near and medium time frame. And despite a number of EPAM specific challenges, we believe that the market for our services continues to be strong and our proposition remains extremely relevant so we were broadly expecting a general uplift in demand going into the second half of 2023. Today, three months later, we understand that with the visibility we had in fewer quarters we underestimated the breadth of the macroeconomic slowdown and the depths of the impact, specifically in the transformational sector of the IT services market. And as you know, we always stated that our customers are almost exclusively Global 2000 enterprises leading global platform companies and venture backed emerging tech firms who rely on EPAM to design, engineering and deploy a large scale transformational and digital engineering programs. Helping them to grow and to differentiate themselves based on technology advanced solution. Our work largely supports their disruptive business model, accelerates growth and specifically targets new product data and cloud platform development and modernization programs. Such work was an ease in our focus area and represents a very significant share of our revenue, especially in comparison with most of other companies within the global IT services segment. Exactly that type of work was largely responsible for a significantly stronger growth rate during the last few decades. Unfortunately, it is exactly those programs are all currently showing visible signs of weakness. Instead, during the last three months, it become very clear that the economic environment is more focused than it has been for decades. On cost optimization, which for now benefiting more traditional outsourcing firms, with strong cost takeout offerings. We understand this is likely a continuous story as the market adjusted to the new economic conditions and the investment requirement changes. It means, this is all global and usually impact on demand and the headwinds associated with the war. We must accept the picture for EPAM is more complex than [indiscernible] and yes, visibly changed today from what we shared with you just three months ago. But before we go into what we're doing to address the immediate challenges and to share some of our more practical priorities and efforts, I want to restate our view on our mid and long term positioning in the future beyond 2023 growth perspective. Let me start with [indiscernible]. Technology change and the disruption of traditional business models was the main growth driver during the last decade. During those decades, we saw only three relatively short recessional periods for the technology sector. There is simple evidence that those companies who invested in their digital transformation during these slow periods and those who adapted to new tech and applied new business models realized by the [tech faster] (ph) versus those who just focused on straight cost cutting become the new leaders in their markets. For us each of those short downturns led to resurgence in demand for our unique retail services and consequently to our historical growth rates of 20 plus% and on very consistent long term basis. We believe that nothing changed from that trend and we are in the middle of another term when we about to adapt a new wave of technology impact. That is why we believe that the current situation is temporary and that in line with the path we will see a similar comeback pattern. Pushing companies, we strive to lead for accelerated investments in new and disruptive complex solution based on rapid adoption of new advanced technologies. With that, we also believe that we will continue to benefit from our traditional capabilities and our delivery track record and that give us the confidence that we are fundamentally better positioned for future accelerated growth than most of other market players. Those critical EPAM pillars includes: First, our continuous focus on differentiated product and platform development versus more traditional outsourcing BPO and [indiscernible] and our engineering DNA built over decades. Those make us the best partner to learn and understand and implement new solutions, which aligns in the next generation technologies. And yes, we don't do want to share with you in anticipation of the like equation that is a public adoption of generative AI and widespread use of large language models or LLMs, we already have dozens active use cases across the global network of practitioners in all our verticals and horizontal functional areas that we are actively proceeding with both internally and with our customers. Second, our investments and broad deployment of EPAM continuum integrated consulting services boost strategy and experience even closer with engineering. And together accelerating the value we can bring from investments in data, in machine learning and GenAI technology by advising on what is possible tomorrow and what can be made real today. And third, all of our customer engagements and our people are enabled by our own digital platforms, which preparing us much stronger for our plan and current capabilities of ML and AI and LLMs to drive increased work productivity and always sharing at a new global scale for us. To sum up, in our view, even with complicated macroeconomic headwinds, the market still points toward disruption and demand companies to transform again to address the challenges posed by many emerging technologies including such as Generative AI, which everyone is talking about it today. But what is difficult to predict right now is, when this come back will start at full speed. We believe that it will be happening rather sooner than later. In quarters, not in years. Still right now, we obviously have an immediate and different challenge. So let us talk about our last quarter and now thinking about the rest of 2023. With all the complexities of current environment, our performance in the first quarter was sorted. While that gives us a better start to move further into complex 2023 environment, we have to acknowledge that the combination of conditions we talked already today of general pullback and delays on transformation spent and the [indiscernible] concerns taken by our customers has now translated into a revision to our initial revenue expectation for this year. With this new view we are drafting visibly our full year revenues and EPS outlook. And during the year, expect to be thinking more about sequential growth metric versus our traditional year-over-year trends. Jason will talk about all relevant details in his section. For now, as long as we are seeing contracted buyers for new builds business, we will be adapting a three pronged approach to navigate the current environment. First, pushing all possible efforts to address our current customer's most present tactical items, including the mix of engagement models, cost takeouts and consolidation priorities, while protecting our share of wallet and long term relationships, all possibly leading to lower short term profitability metrics. Second, winning and quickly growing new business through increased focus on sales and GTM, motions and partnerships. Especially across those champions who would like to use the slow time to build a competitive advantage. Over the last two, three quarters our global business field organization and specialized practice teams have focused on developing new offerings, new engagement models and new ways of working with our customers and have done so with some success, a new momentum and new logo acquisition which will still take some time to realize as larger revenue impact down the line, especially in the current economic climate. And third, continuously investing in our strategic priorities. Which are staying in line with what we communicated before. Expansion of differentiated consulting agency [indiscernible] cloud capability is building, improving our work by delivering strategy implementation simultaneously, expanding our engineering DNA across all strategic global delivery location. All in anticipation for the sharp return on demand for the next generation transformational services. With that, as part of our continuous investment strategy, I want to share some updates on our global delivery expansion programs. During the past quarter, we have made good progress in both maintaining the level of delivery quality in Eastern and Central Europe and strengthening such quality in Central and Western Asia. We have both years benefited from integrating strong EPAM talent moving to many new locations across the regions. As part of our heritage and our core differentiation, Eastern and Central Europe delivery and most notably our Ukrainian operation will continue to be an cornerstone of our proposition. While we accelerate our investments in new center of excellence and while we continue to hire across our global footprint for high demand skills. As part of the global delivery strategy, we continue to focus on building out further our two currently fastest growing regions, India and Latin America. In addition to opening several new locations across those geographies, we are happy to see sizable work streams starting and expanding there. And now not only from our existing clients, but also with brand new logos who are attracted by the advantages demonstrated by EPAM in those regions. It's also important to mention that the configuration of our client footprint in those still relatively new for us geographies now very much represents our traditional client's mix with some of our top 10 customers, but also new ones across multiple verticals from large corporations to technology platform, firms and to software product companies. In our view, it's a very good illustration of the quality of the services we are delivering from the region, confirming that continued investments into engineering excellence programs, education and integrated delivery platforms bring the results we expected to achieve to date. Also with experience over the past few years, we are now able to stand up new locations across EPAM global footprint in months versus years, by leveraging all elements of our digital platform ecosystem, and strong talent acquisition capabilities. We believe during the next few years, we will be able to build the most geo balance delivery talent platform on the market. To conclude, we believe that while we are experiencing and addressing accordingly very specific but still temporary challenges, fundamentally, we are moving in the right direction. Our strategy for future accelerated growth is based on delivering complex business solution driven by advanced disruptive technology and quality engineering. Many of those solutions require unique alignment of consulting and implementation services and are specifically attracted to the client base consisting of leading global enterprises with markets are driven and disrupted by continuous technological transformers. We do believe that such enterprises will have to come back to significant investments into technology build component to lead and disrupt further their respective markets and they will need partners like EPAM to progress. With that, I would like to pass to Jason to share more details and numbers for Q1 and for our change in outlook for the rest of the year.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. Before covering our Q1 results, I wanted to remind you that in addition to our customary non-GAAP adjustments, expenses related EPAM’s manager and commitment to Ukraine and costs associated with the exit of our Russian operations business continuity resources and accelerated employee relocations have been excluded from non-GAAP financial results. We've included additional disclosures specific to these and other related items in our Q1 earnings release. In the first quarter, EPAM delivered solid results. The company generated revenue of $1.21 billion, a year-over-year increase of 3.4% on a reported basis and 4.9% in constant currency terms, reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of 150 basis points. Additionally, the reduction in Russian customer revenues resulting from our decision to exit the market had a 220 basis point negative impact on revenue growth. Excluding Russia revenues year-over-year revenue growth would have been 5.6% reported and over 7% on a constant currency basis. Beginning with our industry verticals, travel and consumer grew 4.9% driven by solid growth in travel and hospitality and muted growth in retail. The ongoing exit of Russia operations also impacted growth in this vertical. Absent the impact, growth would have been 6.7%. Financial services grew 4.1% with strong growth coming from Asset Management and Insurance Services. Excluding Russia customer revenues, growth would have been 12.5%. Business information and media delivered 4.2% growth in the quarter. Software and Hi-tech produced no growth. The lack of growth in the quarter reflected a reduction in revenue from a former top 20 customer we mentioned in our Q4 earnings call and generally slower growth in revenues across a range of customers in the vertical. Life Sciences and Healthcare declined 10.1%. Growth in the quarter was impacted by the ramp down of a large transformational program mentioned during our Q4 earnings call. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered strong growth of 14.7%, driven by clients in manufacturing, automotive and energy. From a geographic perspective, Americas, our largest region representing 59% of our Q1 revenues grew 3.4% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency. EMEA representing 38% of our Q1 revenues grew 10% year-over-year or 13.3% in constant currency. CEE representing 1% of our Q1 revenues contracted 68.8% year-over-year or 70.8% in constant currency. Revenue in the quarter was impacted by our decision to exit our Russian operations and the resulting ramp down of services to Russia customers. And finally, APAC declined 9.4% year-over-year or 6.7% in constant currency terms and now represents 2% of our revenues. Revenue in the quarter was impacted primarily by the ramp down of work at a financial services client. In Q1, revenues from our top 20 clients grew 5.3% year-over-year, while revenues from clients outside our top 20 grew 2.3%. And moving down the income statement, our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 29.3% compared to 33.4% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 31.5% compared to 33.3% for the same quarter last year. Gross margin in Q1 2023 reflects a negative impact of lower utilization and some year-over-year compression in account margins. GAAP SG&A was 17.5% of revenues compared to 20.3% in Q1 of last year. Non GAAP SG&A came in at 15.3% of revenues compared to 15.6% in the same period last year. Both GAAP and non GAAP SG&A expense in Q1 2023 include $9.5 million in severance related expense incurred as the company works to better align its cost structure with the current demand environment. GAAP income from operations was $120 million or 9.9% of revenue in the quarter compared to $129 million or 11% of revenue in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $178 million or 14.7% of revenue in the quarter compared to $189 million or 16.1% of revenue in Q1 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 19.6% versus our Q1 guide of 18%, primarily due to lower excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefit was 22.9%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.73. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.47, reflecting as $0.02 decrease compared to the same quarter in 2022. In Q1, there were approximately 59.3 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to cash flow and our balance sheet, cash flow from operations for Q1 was a positive $87 million compared to a negative $52 million in the same quarter of 2022. Q1 2022 cash flow was negatively impacted by an increase in DSO and the payment of a higher level of company-wide variable compensation based on our 2021 performance. Free cash flow was $79 million compared to a negative free cash flow of $75 million in the same quarter last year. We ended the quarter with over $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. At the end of Q1, DSO was 69 days and compares to 70 days for Q4 2022 and 69 days for the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, we expect DSO will remain steady throughout 2023. Now moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended Q1 with more than 51,100 consultants, designers, engineers, trainers and architects. Production headcount declined 7.1% compared to Q1 2022. The net decrease in headcount is a result of the reduction in Russia based headcount, a lower level of hiring across the organization and a largely completed program designed to produce modest levels of encouraged attrition. Our total headcount for the quarter was more than 57,415 employees. Utilization was 74.9% compared to 78.4% in Q1 of last year and 73.6% in Q4 2022. Now let's turn to our business outlook. We are beginning to see the results of our focus on generating demand from new programs and customers. However, we are also seeing a continuation in the uneven demand environment that began in Q4 2022. And the global economic environment has not yet stabilized sufficiently to support client confidence. The demand environment continues to be characterized by slower decision making, caution around spending and program ramp downs due to uncertainty in certain client end markets. As a result, our overall level of demand is not improving sufficiently to support our initial revenue outlook. As highlighted during our Q4 earnings call, our operations in Ukraine have not been materially impacted and our teams remain highly focused on maintaining uninterested production. Our guidance assumes that we will continue to be able to deliver from our Ukraine delivery centers at productivity levels at or somewhat lower than those achieved in 2022. Consistent with previous cycles, we will continue to thoughtfully calibrate our expense levels, while investing in our capabilities and focusing on the preservation of our talent in preparation for a return of demand. We expect headcount will continue to decline somewhat in Q2 due to limited hiring and more typical attrition and we will limit hiring in the second half until we see improving demand. We expect utilization in the mid-70s throughout the remainder of the year. As a reminder, the exit of our Russian operations and the reduction in Russia customer revenues, produces a tougher year-over-year revenue comparison primarily in the first half of 2023. Moving to our full year outlook. We now expect revenue will be in the range of $4.95 billion to $5 billion reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 3%. On an organic constant currency basis, excluding the impact of the exit from Russia, we expect revenue growth to be just over 3% both at the midpoint of the range. We're currently expecting sequential growth in both Q3 and Q4. However, we no longer expect to be able to generate double digit year-over-year growth in either quarter. We expect GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5% and non GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to continue to be approximately 21%, our non GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation will also continue to be 23%. Earnings per share, we expect the GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $8.11 to $8.31 dollars for the full year and non GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $10.60 to $10.80 dollars for the full year. We now expect weighted average share count of 59.4 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Now moving to our Q2 2023 outlook, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.195 billion to $1.205 billion, producing year-over-year growth rate of less than 1%. On an organic constant currency basis excluding the impact of the exit from Russia, we expect revenue growth to also be less than 1% both at the midpoint of the range. For the second quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 10% to 11% and non GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 14% to 15%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 20% and our non GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation to be approximately 23%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.82 to $1.90 for the quarter. And non GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.38 to $2.46 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59.4 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumption that support our GAAP to non GAAP measurements in the second quarter and remainder of the year. Stock based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $33 million for Q2, and $38 million for each of the remaining quarters. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $6 million for each of the remaining quarters. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be negligible for the remainder of the year. Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be $9.5 million for Q2 and $9 million for each of the remaining quarters. We expect excess tax benefits to be around $6 million for Q2 $4 million for Q3 and $2 million for Q4. In addition to these customary GAAP to non GAAP adjustments and consistent with the prior quarter in 2022, we expect to have ongoing non-GAAP adjustments in 2023 resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Please see our Q1 earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our GAAP to non GAAP guidance. Finally, one more assumption outside of our GAAP to non-GAAP items. With our significant cash position we are generating a healthy level of interest income. We had expected an elevated level of interest income relative to past years when we developed our original full year guidance. However, due to the larger positive impact on EPS in 20 23, we are updating our assumptions regarding interest income and making them explicit. For the remainder of the year, we expect interest income to be $8 million for Q2 and $7 million for each of the remaining quarters. Lastly, I'd like to thank our employees for their continued dedication and focus on our customers. Operator, let's open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
James Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate all the color and details so far this morning. It sounds like most of your revision and view for the rest of the year is attributable to macroeconomic environment. Just wondering if you can kind of give more detail on the underlying assumptions there. And I know back in the previous quarter you had talked about that there was some engagement and reengagement that you need to do with clients. I'm just wondering how that has gone and if that engagement and those kinds of conversations are impacting your outlook at all right now.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Good morning, everybody. I think you're asking if or because we were a [indiscernible] trends. One of the concerns coming from clients because of special conditions we are working and second was [indiscernible] economy. And so, what is the main driver here. And I think definitely both of them were playing a role in our previous estimation. I think at this point we definitely see the economy driving the behavior of the clients and the biggest impact on our kind of guidance and forecast on what's happening. And on top of this, if you remember, our previous guidance call was at the beginning of February and already in the beginning of March we will always hear news from the banking sector from North America first and very quickly from Europe as well. And all of these were translated to increased [indiscernible], which was very visible. Specifically on the transformational programs, as I mentioned. So I think at this point, we believe it’s a general slowdown [indiscernible] latest events.
James Faucette: Got it. Thank you for that, Ark. And then, I guess, from the ramp downs and softness, any sense of how much of that. It sounds like you feel like that that is probably broad based, but any clarity on those ramp downs? And is that -- how much of that maybe idiosyncratic to EPAM, given delivery challenges or it sounds like you think it's more really macro driven. I just want to make sure I understand that.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, that's exactly what I’m saying and clearly after our previous call, some new things were happening and now that were driven by client question based on the economy.
James Faucette: Great. Thanks for that Ark.
Operator: Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Darrin Peller: Hey, thanks guys. If you could help just by maybe dissecting a little bit more around the demand environment versus what you're seeing that's more specific to some of the regions you're in now, some of the newer regions. And what I mean by that is really just whether or not there's been anything that is tougher to execute from some of the new regions you've built into post Russia, post Ukraine or is that really not a factor? And instead, it's really just demand and at the end of the day you have all the talent you need executing the way you should. And then I guess a quick follow on related to that is just pricing dynamics to pass through. What's the latest on the wage environment in those newer regions and how you are executing on that and your ability to pass through on pricing around that?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think that's what we're trying to bring kind of color during this morning [indiscernible] definitely like when the economy acting like this, clients are definitely reacting on this accordingly and the question on pricing and discounts all coming to the play. And this is part of the life right now. It started several quarters ago as we were talking about it, but it's become very visible, specifically today. And that's exactly what we try to highlight that we're executing kind of with multiple approaches. One of them, yes, we do something which not necessarily our traditional approach. We try to put ourselves in client choice. We're trying to understand what we can do and help in short term actively changing some models and focusing on the insurance that we maintain and the relationship with the client and continuously serving them. So -- and that's a big portion of what's happening today. So let's answer to your question. While at the same time there are still transformational deals that’s still happening, not at all at the level [indiscernible] like 12 months ago. And we focus on this and we continuously doing this. Again, we continue to work in the future as we mentioned. But definitely cost pressure is here.
Jason Peterson: So, no real challenges in terms of delivery or the ability to add headcount or to get work done. But as Ark said, it's really an issue of kind of the uncertain macro environment and clearly more uncertain than we expected by the time we kind of get to summer. And we think that's having an impact on customers investment decisions. From a wage standpoint, we did do our promo campaign here in Q2. And as we talked about, we clearly were seeing wage inflation over the last year, but I think you're going to see a more muted wage inflation environment through the remainder of the year. And then just the pricing environment is clearly not one that is super supportive of price increases and we're finding both clients are cautious in terms of spend and in terms of rates. And even sort of new engagements or requiring that we sort of sharpen our pencils a little bit.
Darrin Peller: Just a very quick follow-up. You guys have always done a good job of having more visibility than most, and you try to take that into accounting guidance being conservative at oftentimes. I mean how do we feel about it now? I know you've probably given the macro uncertainty wanted to take as much of a stat of being conservative as possible in this case, is that fair?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Listen, we understand what you're asking, but I think we reflect on exactly what we're seeing right now. And unfortunately, last quarter, we were seeing this differently.
Darrin Peller: Understood.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And the stability right now is very different, like this is a pretty new environment. I don't think we can compare this with second quarter of 2020, it was a different reaction of the clients much more sharpened. So right now, it's different, but yes, that's what we see. And I think everybody needs to think about quarter-by-quarter adjustments because that was what we will be the next quarter.
Darrin Peller: Okay. Understood. Thanks, Ark. Thanks, Jason.
Operator: Please standby for our next question. The next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Bryan Bergin: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First one, just a follow-up on budget behavior. So I'm curious if you're seeing clients cut an outright cancel programs or if this is more so deferral and delay of spend. So more like a wait-and-see approach? I'm trying to understand if there is potential pent-up recovery that could actually form later this year or if the potential budget dollars are more or less out for 2023?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we also try to educate how we're thinking about it. And based on what we saw in our previous slide based on what we think happened with technology right now. We mentioned that we're thinking in terms of quarters, but that's a question how many quarters two, three, four quarters. Not in terms of [indiscernible] the market will restore. That's our belief, we're making mistakes as everybody else. But in this case, still the same quarters versus years.
Jason Peterson: And so, we saw those couple of ramp downs that we talked about, which one in the health care space and one in the tech space and those were largely -- not largely, they were very much sort of economy-based. A client making a decision just based on kind of how they were looking at their future revenues and profits. What we're seeing today is more kind of, let's say, a trimming or adjustment to spend, which is generally a contraction. So Bryan, it's not a people saying, Hey, look, I'm not going to do any work. It's just people sort of reducing their spend. And as Ark said, eventually, we think that people have returned to a need to make the investments to make their businesses competitive and successful in the future.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And it's definitely combination across all of the different environment. When somebody telling you that we will delay for one quarter, we will start next quarter and the next quarter, we said we have to do it for another quarter and what is happening for several then. Okay, that's not a cancellation, but it's definitely not allowing us to count on this.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. That's helpful. Okay. And then just shifting over to margin here. So can you just talk about any update around your thoughts on structural margin as the business does recover? And then, near-term levers to balance the profitability and the global diversification efforts. I'm just trying to get a sense on how you're expecting gross margin really to trend forward?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So I think with the updated guidance is that, we're probably thinking that utilization is going to remain more in the mid-70s rather than the high 70s in the second half. However, we do have characteristics in the second half, with generally the higher bill date in Q3, social security caps and a little bit of trend up in utilization. So I am expecting that gross margin will be maybe somewhere around the 33% for the second half. SG&A and other areas of variable expense, we're definitely working to control. And so, SG&A will likely be below 15% as a percentage of revenue. And then what we're looking to do is still run the business at sort of close to 16% for the full year. But what that means is the second half will probably be closer to our -- the top end of our traditional 16% to 17% range.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Please standby for the next question. The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is now open.
David Grossman: Thank you. Good morning. I wonder if I could just go back to a question that was asked a little bit earlier. If I look at your guidance for the year, just take the midpoint of about $5 billion, it looks like you are kind of guiding to sequential increases in revenue in the back half of the year. So I think, Ark, you said you're guiding to what you see. So does that imply that you have some visibility on backlog or new ramps that give you confidence that revenue growth will kind of accelerate sequentially in the back half of the year?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we see programs which started to show up in conversations and based on this, we seek for moderate increase in demand. Especially like if you think about how much technology is potentially changing; as we speak, a lot of experimentation starting and we've seen a lot of conversation across practically all industry components. So that's how we'll get right now for the H2, but it would be moderate increase.
Jason Peterson: Yes. And despite, obviously, the guidance for Q2 and some of the growth figures you see in the top 20 and the below top 20 is, we aren't seeing a significant amount of new logo activity. So there's a fair number of wins, a lot of new MSAs being signed. The challenge right now, David, is that most of those new programs are relatively small. And so, they're not contributing to the same extent revenue growth as they might have in the past years, but we are sort of hopeful that they'll grow over time. And then just a quick comment on the growth rates that we saw with the top 20 and the below top 20 is with the movement of clients between those cohorts and particularly the two clients we've talked about in technology and health care when they move from the top 20 to out of the top 20, it tends to distort the growth rates, particularly in the below top 20. And so, that's why we're seeing a somewhat lower level of growth outside our top 20 clients.
David Grossman: Got it. And just to go back to your comments, I guess, 90 days ago when you -- I think you talked about client that shifted a workload to another vendor and you just really didn't get notification, I guess, until late last year. Have you seen any other major clients shift workloads to other vendors over the course of the last 90 days or any activity that would suggest that's still a possibility this year?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don't think we saw during the last 90 days, specifically as we saw more delays and more delays with decisions and delays with the strategic programs, which we were promising. At the same time, there is a pretty big consolidation effort across the industry. And specifically, consolidation efforts versus pricing and cost cuts, cost kind of sales. So it could be impact across the portfolio in this area, for sure.
David Grossman: So just to be clear, I can...
Arkadiy Dobkin: This is a whole part of the pressure. That's exactly what we try to -- I try to explain this morning that when transformational progress on the [indiscernible] was becoming the main driver. We all know it. And the recent redistribution of the budgets is results. But again, that's why we show the stat, which we're sure. On the other side, it's critically important, and that's what we believe is the reason. Now both quarters, the situation will be changing as we -- many times we see how this redistribution of work were coming back because then you need like actually to deliver and deliver with the quality and deliver on new technologies and business changes. We unfortunately have to share our projections right now as is exactly because of this, because of cost situation and many decisions which clients making right now.
David Grossman: All right. I think I got it. Thanks very much.
Operator: Please standby for our next question. The next question comes from Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Margaret Nolan: Thanks you. Jason, you started to get into this a little bit, but you've mentioned in past quarters that new client additions were kind of a big focus area for the sales force for 2023 after focusing more on delivery in 2022. Is that still an area that you're really focused on investing into for 2023? Or is that sort of changing alongside the demand environment?
Jason Peterson: No. That continues to be a really significant focus of the company, right? So in addition to maintaining the existing relationships and growing in existing accounts, there's a huge focus on new logo activity. And just the only challenge right now -- in past years, you might have initiated a new relationship and seen millions of dollars of revenue in the first quarter and maybe over $10 million in the second quarter or third quarter. And right now, just people are more cautious about their budgets. So those relationships are starting with kind of smaller projects. But I think over the period of quarters, may take into 2024. I think a number of those new relationships are going to produce growth, and I think it will begin to show up in our numbers. And at the same time, and I think I talked with some of you kind of face-to-face is we got a little bit of a two steps forward, one step back scenario where we are having some of the larger clients, not discontinued relationship or shift work to another vendor. But what they are doing is they're trimming their budgets. And so, while we get some of these incremental revenues from new clients, then we also have these offsets that are coming from larger clients looking to sort of trim their spend, and that's kind of the behavior that we see in Q2 and was more pronounced than we had expected when we guided in our way in February.
Margaret Nolan: Okay. And then can you comment on how much of a priority M&A is right now or share repurchase?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So M&A continues to be a priority. As always, we want to make certain that we're acquiring assets that we think can be integrated successfully and will help us sort of drive and evolve our business. And so, we have active discussions going on today. I can't comment what we're going to close and when, but certainly, we've got some active conversations occurring and you likely would see something in the future. And then from a share buyback standpoint, we did initiate our program in Q1, it was modest, less than $10 million bought back, I think, 30,000 shares. And I would expect that we would continue to move forward with participation, although we don't have a predetermined level for Q2 but expect to be active in terms of share buybacks in the quarter.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And on M&A, I would -- as it -- it's pretty much same approach we have before. We're looking for things, which is longer term or strategic, and there is no any specific efforts to make situation better for the short term. So, it's all about longer term what would be happening in the [indiscernible]
Margaret Nolan: Okay. Thanks, Ark. Thanks, Jason.
Operator: Please stand by for our next question. The next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Ramsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question this morning. I wanted to ask about the -- some comments you made about clients, obviously, shifting to more kind of cost takeout focused work how much of an internal pivot is required for you to address and meet that shifting demand? Do you have to reskill or invest? Or is it just a -- does it take time to get there? Or is it just a matter of you have the skills on hand, you just have to sort of change the orientation a little bit in terms of kind of getting there with your clients?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we do believe we have -- again, as you know, as we communicated, it's not a primary focus of our services lines. But at the same time, we have the skills we were building on [indiscernible] we have people who understand what to do in this area. And from technology skills in some situations we have definitely capabilities to apply this for cost-out engagements. So we put in our efforts around it. I don't think it's about specific risk [indiscernible]. It's still, even with this effort, it's relatively a small portion of what we do it in general, and there is no goal to repurpose company for this type of cases. So this is much more tactical effort for us those quarters, which we believe this type of trend will be before the market will come back. So we still invest in the very specific area for the future growth.
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And could you also provide a little more color on the pipeline right now? Is it -- has there been a shift to any particular type of deal, large versus small? Is it more new logo versus expansion? Are there easier -- is there a path of least resistance there? How is the composition of the pipeline evolving?
Jason Peterson: I mean there are still a handful of large deals that are out there, they were expected to generate revenues in the second half that are significant mainframe to cloud type engagements that will have significant revenues. And I think we talked about this in the last conference call as well, which is that, most of the new work that we're seeing is generally smaller in size. There are relatively fewer clients who are kicking off large-scale transformation programs. At this time, they're looking for kind of near-term return on their investment. They're looking for modifications updates to existing platforms rather than sort of creating new platforms. And again, it's back to the, let's say, the instability in the macroeconomic view is long as people aren't certain whether the bottoms are going to be in Q3 or Q4 or Q1 of 2024, it just makes it more difficult for people to make investments in large-scale transformation programs.
Ramsey El-Assal: Got it. Thank you so much.
Operator: Please standby for the next question. The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is now open.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Good morning, folks. Ark, I appreciate the thoughtful comments at the top of the call. First question goes to Jason. Is the idea, Jason, to hold the line on operating margins because you kind of mentioned quarter-to-quarter variability and the need to be flexible based on revenues, not having visibility into revenues. So is that the idea that you will hold the line on margins?
Jason Peterson: Yes. Our focus continues to be on a return to stronger demand over some period of time as Ark talked about, whether that's two or three or four quarters. And to make sure that we're making investments in the business that will allow us to continue to advance our capabilities and be successful in the market. And at the same time, we are being very careful in terms of spending really addressing discretionary costs, controlling anything that's more variable in nature. And Ashwin, trying to drive the business at least to the do it around a 16% or maybe slightly below that range. So trying to maintain profitability throughout the year at 16%. And what you'll find then is that the second half will have stronger profitability just because there are characteristics that make gross margin stronger. And then with continued focus on SG&A efficiency, I expect that SG&A will go below 15%. So again, it will be a focus on the longer term, so we don't want to do anything that hinders ourselves to return to growth. And at the same time, we want to be careful about our discretionary spending.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Understand. And as it sort of relates to the portfolio of services and your delivery do your clients, particularly the older or more -- the more tenured clients, do they all understand at this point that you have a more diversified delivery than before that it's not primarily three Central and East European countries? Or does that come up as a factor? And I just wanted to also clarify from Ark. Is there an intent here to get into things like application management and so on, more deeply broaden out the service portfolio in response to what's going on.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So this is what we do as we speak. At the same time -- okay, let's -- from the beginning. First of all, absolutely, clients understand that we have a different delivery kind of structure today. So that's what also I was talking this more about that we bringing new clients and existing clients coming to new geographies, which they didn't experience with the bank before. And we have pretty good progress because it's not already like one or two quarters. It's already almost like 18 months. And we have a new client, which is very typical clients as for engineering differentiation. And technology services, which come into new locations with us as well and appreciate the differentiation which we them because again, as I mentioned, the direction was taken even before war started for globalization of our services and investments were done in different regions for some time. First of all in India, but then very actively in Latin America as well. Other degrees for us like Central Western Asia, which is benefiting strongly from the Italian from our traditional historical locations as well. So, which is a little bit more predictable from this point of view for clients, too, because some projects move in there because of the talent well. So from this point of view, there is everybody that is direction. So from the portfolio of the business, definitely, we do more new saw experiencing with our staff. We also were growing over the years application management component as well, but it's still a relatively smaller portion of what we do. And it's addition user addition to transformational work, which we do it as soon as we do it big modernization, we have taken on increasing components of application management as well, but still focused on transformation program, as I mentioned. What we see right now is that the delayed and we do believe that while Q2 definitely was impacted I think some of that will start to be realizing in H2, and that's why we believe that it would be some growth there because there are too many programs and we don't believe that clients will be able to afford to delay the full load. They already delayed them for multiple quarters. So I think it's -- it will start with H2.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Understood. Thank you for that.
Operator: Please standby for the next question. The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Tyler DuPont: Good morning, Ark and Jason. This is Tyler DuPont on for Jason. Thanks for taking the question. I know I'm putting up on time, so I'll try to be quick. I think you briefly touched on this, but maybe just to ask it in a different way and just to clarify on my end, if you could spend a bit of time talking about the linearity of the quarter. For example, the last print was in the second week of February. And at that time, you talked about some positive green shoots. Did the demand picture fall off significantly in March, particularly? And if so, is that fully attributable to the banking sector crisis? Or just any clarity there would be helpful.
Arkadiy Dobkin: All right. I think we do believe that the news of the market was impacted a lot of decisions. And it's not necessarily impacting just banking or financial services, but most of the other industries put a lot of programs on hold. And you can see with company like this announcement of other technology-driven companies due to the last couple of months. So this is the sole part of the same very kind of sharp reaction of the situation. For transformational aspect of all the services which we provide. And as a reminder, that this is majority, big majority of what we do.
Tyler DuPont: Okay. Great. Thanks, Ark. I appreciate that. And then just as a follow-up, it seems like while financials and travel seem to put up pretty solid growth numbers ex-Russia, I was a little bit more surprised to see the life sciences and to a lesser degree, high-tech experienced a bit of a slowdown. So I was just wondering if you could parse out what you're seeing in those verticals? Like how much of that decline, for example, was from the ramp down of those large clients mentioned on the last call compared to, I guess, as Jason described, more of a trimming of spend across the client base?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So quickly, on the Life sciences and health care, it's largely a significant sort of ramp down. And specifically, they put a program. They effectively sort of ended a program kind of restarted some work, but not specific to that program, and there's been a very significant difference in the revenues we generated last year from that client from the revenues we expect we'll generate this year. And then, from a high tech standpoint, again, you've got the one client, but then you also just have a generalized kind of slowdown in spend and I think we all see in the news from the high-tech sector.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And if you will, this is, in some ways could be accidental or driven by a couple of clients, but in some ways, very logical industries, if you see, because software and high-tech more obvious life science, if you've seen how much investment was done there during the core time and how much all the investment was done as well with current situation, some things should be done and a lot of sinking would be that way vestment were pool. So I think it's a lot of thinking is by science industry right now after a huge spread due to the pandemic or big portion of pandemic.
Tyler DuPont: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: At this time, I would now like to turn the call back to Ark for closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you again for joining us. And, yes, it's unusual period in our kind of life after a significant growth and now seeing a little bit different well, but again, our belief that technology will be derived in the future. We didn't talk too much about all this nice conversation about open AI, et cetera. But we do believe that a lot of engagement, digital ecosystem will have to be rebuilt very, very soon and it will be inclined for competition and those who would like to drive the future will come to us for help as well. So thank you, and talk to you in three months.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-16 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to EPAM Systems Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
David Straube: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind those listening that some of our comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measure and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website. With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. 12 months ago on February 17, we were looking towards -- to 2022 with optimism. [indiscernible] has been added to S&P 500 and we expect it to grow almost 40% and generate over $5 billion in revenues in this year. Even with some falling volumes, the Russian invasion struck the world one week later and put us on a very different place or priorities. The new reality redefines the meaning of success for us. And we are very grateful to the tens of thousands of EPAMers and our customers around the world who mobilized support for people in our business during the past year. Our success in 2022 was defined by new criteria and priorities, many of which we have shared it with you in our regular calls and updates during 2022. Priority one was to do everything possible for the safety of our people in Ukraine. Next, our global mobility mission was immediately repurposed and scaled to support over 10,000 EPAMers. We chose to stay [indiscernible] countries and many with their families. In addition, our business continuity strategy was adapted to include an exit of our business from Russia. And throughout the year, our customer focus was further elevated to ensure that even with environment that was anything but normal, our clients continued to bear the consistent, high-quality of delivery and level of service that they would expect under normal business conditions. 2022 was in every way the most disruptive year for EPAM I remember, and I have a previous history to remember all of them. You might ask why we are considering 2022 a relative success. As a result of our 2022 efforts, in 2023 we have a global delivery footprint in urbanization that makes EPAM one of the most geo-diversified IT services companies in the world, and the one that now operates in more than 50 countries. When we began 2022, roughly 60% of our delivery was in just three largest locations [indiscernible] together. And today, only 30% of our talent is there. While we expect that will fall closer to 20%, 25% concentration by the end of this year with accelerated growth outside. We also didn't lose any significant clients during the last 12 months despite actively running a global delivery location rebalancing program. And in real-time, we were continuously developing new capabilities across our major markets. We were also prudent with our delivery out of Ukraine. We can consistently demonstrate productivity and quality, very much in line with previous expectations. And finally, that our new locations are very much in line with EPAM productivity and quality engineering standards term. Why then we use a relative qualifier to the stated success up to date? Simply, the war within Ukraine is not over. And we believe that it will be our daily reality for some time to come. Having accomplished what was extremely difficult transformation, and while finding our [indiscernible] much stronger, more capable and effective company than we have been before. And with a strong foundation to build upon to the network of our journey, we do realize that it's very much an ongoing process which demands our even higher-level preparedness for new and unexpected challenges. Additionally, as I've mentioned during our last earnings call, some of our partners and customers have been messaging their expectation for global slowdown in demand and started taking resultant actions to better align their businesses to the new environment. While we also expected [indiscernible] slowdown, our reality happened to be more complex than the typical slowdown indicated by others. When we shared our Q3 results in November, we were not yet seen a detailed picture of what EPAM specific demand environment would become in 2023. Today, what we are experiencing is slightly more than caution related to macroeconomic conditions. The emerging view is specific to both, the overall global market conditions and also reflects the client expectation as part of our mitigation and diversification plans, and their corresponding decision-making process during the last year. First, we now understand that some of our clients didn't expect that we would mitigate the past 12 months as well as we did. So at some point, they choose to mitigate their risk associated with our situation in advance and to consider alternative for them new work streams. We believe that while they are now comfortable with our diversified delivery footprint and committed to continue working with us, a number of decisions made two, three quarters before became visible for us just now. Second, due to immediate redistribution of our talent to new locations, our overall cost structure and cost to our customers of our [indiscernible] were disrupted to some level. During the [indiscernible] environment, the changes were accommodated was relative eased. But in current slow environment, the new location and price and mix present a greater challenge, at least while we were fixing the imbalance. Third, there are several key verticals, such as software and hi-tech, for example, which were disproportionately impacted with the current slowdown. And there are also several large clients, which were impacted by their own specific circumstances during the last several months, who had to delay previously committed initiatives. And finally, our attention on bringing in net new logos during the last 12 months was de-prioritized as we focused on retaining our existing customers and repositioning our global delivery as our key priorities. So because of those EPAM-specific factors, we believe we are now seeing a lower revenue growth outlook at the beginning of 2023 than we historically would expect at this time. Our current view for the year now shows relatively low growth during the first half of the year, with acceleration in growth in the second half of 2023, potentially approaching the high-teens in Q4, and with opportunity to come back to our pre-pandemic 20%-plus organic growth profile right after that. At this point, we are investing in our customer and partner relationships and working across our global portfolio to build on our strong [indiscernible] differentiators with the value-added services in consulting client data and customer experience. These are long-term programs which we've had underway for several years. And our current positioning as a top-tier partner to our clients, and additional credibility we built during the last 12 months should help us to create uplift in demand going into the second half of 2023. Today, we continue to stabilize our delivery global platform and develop talent across new geographies. A significant part of those continuous efforts will allow us to restoring the balanced cost structure across all major delivery centers. At the same time, while we are fully committed to continuing our investments in our strategic differentiators, we are watching very carefully the balance of those investments to our current and immediately visible demand. Given the uncertainty of looking at our business was from a long and shorter-term point of view. We are heavy utilizing our digital platforms, which have been instrumental in guiding our decisions so far and allowing us to monitor our business on a daily basis and making real-time calibrations when necessary to ensure that we protect our best talent as a key priority while still driving towards our historic growth and profitability levels. On the general slowdown issue, we do believe that in today's technology dependent world, the real impact of slow demand on the IT services global market, most likely should be limited just to several quarters. The pull-back will encourage new players to enter the market with new technology led business solutions and push enterprises to respond with new investments in order to protect their competitive positions. This in turn should accelerate growth for EPAM, as our proposition is focusing exactly on [indiscernible] to bring new strategy and implementation simultaneously in most [indiscernible] and efficient ways. So our goal today is to prepare EPAM exactly for the time and to be able to respond fast for the next growth and capability challenges. That is why the plan to focus our attention in the next quarters to further stabilize our global operations and to continuously invest into new talent, new capabilities, new [indiscernible] and new markets, and to maintain our strong engineering DNA, but this time as a much more globally diversified company than ever in the past. Looking at our results for 2022, we generated over $4.800 billion in revenues, reflecting a greater than 28% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $10.90, a 20% increase over fiscal 2021. And we also generated $382 million of free cash flow. And one more time we did all that during the year when we had almost 60% of our talent in regions directly or indirectly impacted by war and when we were supporting many thousands of EPAMers and their families due to the continuous relocation process. In 2023, we are committed to accelerating our mission of becoming a true world orchestrator for our customers, and we are working every day to stay focused on our customer needs and demands, even while we continue rolling our geographic expansions, our capabilities in our commercial offering of a larger more diversified and more capable EPAM. It is a bit strange to talk today again 12 months later about crossing $5 billion revenue mark in 2023, as we did back in February 2022. The war took a year of our life, year of our growth. But we all know too well that it's just nothing in comparison to what people in Ukraine must go through today and what is happening on the ground in Turkey as we speak right now. So that is why with all that, what didn't change at all is our confidence that with what we build and continuously building, we would be able to navigate the challenges and come back to our 20% plus organic growth rate in the next several quarters and to our $10 billion aspiration in the next several years. With that said, let me turn the call over to Jason, who will talk about our Q4 and full-year 2022 results and our business outlook for 2023.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. Before covering our Q4 results, I wanted to remind everyone that in addition to our customary non-GAAP adjustments, expenditures related to EPAM's humanitarian commitment to Ukraine, the exit of our Russian operations and costs associated with accelerated the employee relocations had been excluded from non-GAAP financial results. We have included additional disclosures specific to these and other related items in our Q4 earnings release. In the fourth quarter, EPAM delivered solid results. The company generated revenues of $1.23 billion, a year-over-year increase of 11.2% on a reported basis and 14.4% in constant currency terms, reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of 320 basis points. Additionally, the reduction in Russian customer revenues resulting from our decision to exit the Russian market had a 440 basis point negative impact on revenue growth. Excluding Russia revenues, reported year-over-year revenue growth would have been 15.6% and constant currency growth would have been almost 19%. Beginning with our industry verticals, travel and consumer grew 16%, driven by strong growth in travel and hospitality with some moderation in retail and consumer goods, as customers exhibited incremental caution in the last few months of 2022. The ongoing exit of the Russian market also impacted the growth in this vertical. Absent the impact, growth would have been 19% or 25.4% in constant currency. Financial services grew 2.4% with very strong growth coming from asset management and insurance. Excluding our Russia customer revenues, growth would have been 17.8% and 20.8% in constant currency. Software and Hi-Tech grew 10.3% in the quarter. Growth in the quarter reflected a reduction in revenue from a customer that was previously in our top 20, in addition to slower generalized growth in customer revenues across the vertical. Life sciences and healthcare grew 11.5%. Growth in the quarter was partially impacted by the unexpected ramp-down of a large transformation program at a customer that was previously EPAM's top 10. We currently anticipate further ramp-downs in this customer spending in Q1 of 2023. Business Information and Media delivered 10.9% growth in the quarter. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered strong growth of 20.8%, driven by clients in manufacturing and automotive, as well as energy. From a geographic perspective, the Americas, our largest region, representing 59% of our Q4 revenues, grew 14.7% year-over-year or 15.6% in constant currency. EMEA, representing 37% of our Q4 revenues, grew 18% year-over-year, or 25.7% in constant currency. The accelerated growth in the quarter is partially the result of recent acquisitions. CEE, representing 1% of our Q4 revenues, contracted 71.8% year-over-year, or 72.6% in constant currency. Revenue in the quarter was impacted by our decision to exit the Russian market and the resulting ramp-down of services to Russian customers. And finally, APAC was flat year-over-year, but actually grew 3.8% in constant currency terms and now represents 2% of our revenues. In Q4, revenues from our top 20 clients grew 8% year-over-year, while revenues from clients outside our top 20 grew 13%. Moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 32.4% compared to 34.3% in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 34.1% compared to 35.9% for the same quarter last year. Gross margin in Q4 2022 reflects the negative impact of lower utilization and the positive impact of a more normalized variable compensation expense compared to Q4 2021. Gross margin in the quarter was also negatively impacted by the timing difference associated with EPAM's ongoing efforts to align bill rates based on employee relocations, most of which have been accomplished in 2022. GAAP SG&A was 16.6% of revenues compared to 17.2% in Q4 of last year. And non-GAAP SG&A came in at 14.8% of revenue compared to 15.6% in the same period last year. The SG&A results for Q4 reflected efficiencies made primarily in our facilities footprint and lower variable compensation compared to Q4 2021. GAAP income from operations was $170 million or 13.8% of revenue in the quarter, compared to $166 million or 15% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $220 million or 17.8% of revenue in the quarter compared to $206 million or 18.6% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 22.9% versus our Q4 guide of 21%, due primarily to lower excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, as well as the impact of the change in certain tax regulations. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits and includes the impact of the change in certain tax regulations was 23.5%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $2.61. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.93, reflecting a $0.17 increase and a 6.2% growth over the same quarter in 2021. In Q4, there were approximately 59.3 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q4 was $186 million compared to $285 million in the same quarter of 2021. Free cash flow was $165 million compared to free cash flow of $228 million in the same quarter last year. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. At the end of Q4, DSO was 70 days and compares to 69 days in Q3, 2022, and 62 days in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, we expect DSO will remain steady in 2023. Moving on to a few operational metrics for the quarter. We ended Q4 with more than 52,850 consultants, designers, engineers, trainers and architects. Production headcount growth was relatively flat compared to Q4 2021. Our total headcount for the quarter was more than 59,250 employees. Utilization was 73.6% compared to 76.8% in Q4 of last year and 73.5% in Q3 of 2022. Turning to our full year results for 2022. Revenues for the year were $4,825 million, producing 28.4% reported growth and 32.4% on a constant-currency basis when compared to 2021. During 2022, our acquisitions contributed approximately 5% to our growth. Excluding Russia revenues, reported year-over-year revenue growth would have been approximately 32.1%, and constant currency growth would have been approximately 36.3%. GAAP income from operations was $573 million, an increase of 5.7% year-over-year and represented 11.9% of revenue. Our non-GAAP income from operations was $818 million, an increase of 20.6% over the prior year and represented 17% of revenue. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 17.3%, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.4%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $7.09. Non-GAAP diluted EPS, which excludes adjustments for stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs and other certain one-time items was $10.90, reflecting a 20.4% increase over fiscal 2021. In 2022, there were approximately 59.2 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And finally, cash flow from operations was $464 million compared to $572 million for 2021. And free cash flow was $382 million, reflecting a 59.3% adjusted net income conversion. Cash flow in 2022 reflected expenses associated with our ongoing humanitarian efforts in supporting our Ukrainian employees and certain cash impacts related to the exit of our Russian operations. We're very pleased with our 2020 results given the significant amount of disruption in transformation which we navigated throughout the year. Now let's turn to guidance. For 2023, we will resume providing a full year outlook, in addition to guidance for the next quarter. To date, our operations in Ukraine have not been materially impacted and our teams remain highly focused on maintaining uninterrupted production. Our guidance assumes that we will continue to be able to deliver from our Ukraine delivery centers, productivity levels at or somewhat lower than those achieved in 2022. As we mentioned during our Q3 earnings call, we began to see signs of moderation in demand, including delays in decision-making and additional scrutiny on program budgets early in Q4. At that time, this was isolated to a few customers in the retail and consumer goods industries. Since then we've seen further evidence of slower decision-making and caution around spending, including some program ramp-downs. For most clients, caution around budgets has only resulted in a slowdown in growth. But for some clients, we experienced actual reductions in spend in Q4, combined with continued cautious spending entering Q1. For two customers that were in our top 20 in 2022, we've seen ramp-downs in programs, which will negatively impact Q1 revenues. We expect neither of these customers to be in our top 20 in Q1, but we already see one of those customers once again requesting incremental project teams. At this time, we are expecting a lower level of revenue in Q1, producing a slower start to our 2023 fiscal year. Consistent with previous cycles, where we managed through a temporary softening in demand, we will continue to thoughtfully calibrate our expense levels, while focusing on the preservation of our talent in preparation for expected stronger 2023 second-half demand. In the first half of 2023, we expect headcount will continue to decline as a result of reduction in hiring, combined with normal levels of attrition. We are planning on returning growth and production in headcount in the second half of 2023. We expect utilization in the mid-70s in the first half of the year as demand and supply normalize with utilization in the second half of the year expected to return to our more traditional 77% to 79% range. As a reminder, the exit of the Russian market and the reduction in Russia customer revenues produces a tougher year-over-year revenue comparison, primarily in the first half of 2023. Starting with our full year outlook. Revenue growth will be at least 9% on both a reported and constant currency basis. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be negligible on a full-year basis. Additionally, at this time, there is no inorganic revenue contribution for 2023. So our guide includes organic revenue growth only. Excluding the impact of the exit of the Russian market, reported revenue growth is expected to be approximately 11%. We expect first half revenue growth to be in the single digits, returning to double-digit revenue growth in the second half of the year. In Q4 2023, we expect revenue growth in the high teens. We expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 21%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation will be 23%. For earnings per share, we expect the GAAP-diluted EPS will be in the range of $8.64 to $8.84 for the full year and non-GAAP diluted EPS will be in the range of $11.15 to $11.35 for the full year. We expect a weighted average share count of 59.6 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For Q1 of 2023, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.200 billion to $1.210 billion, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 3%. Our guidance reflects an unfavorable FX impact of 2% and the year-over-year growth rate on a constant currency basis is expected to be approximately 5%. We expect negligible contribution to revenue growth from acquisitions. Adjusted for the impact of our decision to exit the Russian market, constant currency revenue growth would be approximately 8%. For the first quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 14% to 15%. Income from operations reflects the impact of the resetting of social security caps and lower utilization, which we expect to improve throughout the year. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 18% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation to be approximately 23%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.66 to $1.74 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.38 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59.5 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements in 2023. Stock based compensation expenses is expected to be approximately $152 million with $35 million in Q1, $36 million in Q2 and $81 million in the remaining quarters. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $22 million for the year, evenly spread across each quarter. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be nominal for the year. Tax-effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $44 million for the year, with $12 million in Q1, $10 million in Q2 and $11 million in each remaining quarter. And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $23 million for the full year with approximately $8 million in Q1, $6 million in Q2 and $9 million in the remaining quarters. Related to the support of our Ukrainian employees, through December 31, 2022, EPAM has spent approximately $45 million as part of the company's $100 million humanitarian commitment to our Ukrainian employees and their families. We expect further humanitarian expenditures will be made during 2023. Lastly, our Board of Directors recently approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the company to purchase up to $500 million of the company's common stock over the next 24 months. This program will allow the company to substantially offset dilution associated with the issuance of employee equity. We expect to continue to generate solid free cash flows in 2023 and even stronger free cash flows in 2024. With our significant cash position and our confidence in EPAM's ability to generate strong free cash flows, we believe the company can both continue to pursue significant strategic acquisitions while evolving our capital allocation strategy to include a share buyback program. Again, my thanks to all the EPAMers who made 2022 a successful year and will help us drive growth throughout 2023. Operator, let's open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.
Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question this morning. I wanted to ask about Ark's comments on some clients preemptively making the decision to move some workloads sort of off of EPAM and that sort of playing out as we speak. I guess the question is, is that dynamic already largely complete, or is that something that's sort of ongoing into -- deeper into the year? And then maybe you could speak to how do you -- if you can and how you can go about winning those workloads back?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think with the [indiscernible] first of all, it's very difficult to measure what's happening, but we have not taken -- say that work taken from EPAM. What we were saying, look, we are realizing right now that some work -- future work which we traditionally will be getting from existing client base were waking probably to some alternative vendors and decisions were made to [indiscernible]explore this several quarters ago when clients were not sure how well we're going to navigate the whole disruption in Eastern Europe. So again, it's very difficult to measure, but seeing the current demand situation in Q1, that's what we assume happening. And the reconfirmation of this is not necessarily easy to get. At the same time, we know that with majority of the client, as we mentioned, we didn't lose practically any client or didn't lose significant clients at all. So they understand that we have been able to prove that we can navigate continuously working from Ukraine and the quality of our delivery is comparable with traditional, even when working in our new destinations of the world. And we believe that right now there is a level of comfort that clients will be considering us for future work as well. And there is confirmation for this. But at the same time, we mentioned cost changes as well. This is another challenge or another thing which we are actively working to make sure that we bring in the balance there too.
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay, thank you. And one quick follow-up from me. Maybe Jason, could you comment on the margin cadence this year? Should we expect margins to sort of step up along with revenue in somewhat of a straight line as we move deeper into the year and all the way to the fourth quarter, or is there any other color on just the cadence in margins that you might need to share?
Jason Peterson: Yeah, let me you actually use this opportunity to be a little clearer on kind of what we think we'll see in 2023. And so, I think the first statement I would make is, clearly, we were very thoughtful about our guidance with a 15.5% to 16.5% adjusted IFR range. At the same time, we do anticipate that we would operate above the midpoint of that range in 2023. And you're correct that in the first half of the year, we expect to see lower levels of profitability. And then in the second half of the year higher levels of profitability. And let me take this opportunity to be sort of specific. So, we entered 2023 with a reset of Social Security caps and a lower utilization that resulted from some of those ramp-downs that I talked about earlier. So we expect to see gross margin in the first half of the year probably in the 31% to 32% range, and quite possibly closer to 31% than 32%. At the same time, with the lower level of revenue, I think you're going to see SG&A go somewhat above 15% in the first half. And then what I anticipate in the second half with stronger growth, a stronger bill days -- greater bill days in the second half, improved utilization and we will be focusing on kind of matching our cost to our demand. And then a little bit of SG&A efficiency that results when you have the stronger revenue growth that you would see an improvement in the gross margin, probably around the 34% range in the second half. And then what you would see is SG&A below 15% in the second half. So again, so SG&A above 15% in the first half of the fiscal year and below 15% in the second half.
Ramsey El-Assal: Very helpful. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Bryan Bergin: Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask on the outlook here. So as you built the 1Q and the 2023 growth outlook, is that a baseline from 4Q and really the December client activity you saw, or is that more sort of a real-time view of client contract into the last few weeks? I'm trying to understand the underlying assumptions there in that full-year guide. And maybe whether you have a different level of visibility to the full year target versus what you would normally have at this point in the year, just given all the moving parts.
Jason Peterson: Yeah. Clearly, it's a more challenging environment to sort of forecast. And clearly, I think we're all seeing some positives around the macroeconomic environment that maybe gets us a little bit more comfortable. But as we exited 2022, we clearly saw slow December and I would say a slow January. And what I think we're beginning to see is what I would call, a little bit of green shoots of incremental demand as clients potentially get more comfortable with what 2023 might look like. And so with this, I guess, full year view shows clearly that the start of Q1 and then we're beginning to see more activity in terms of at least RFPs and other kind of requests for discussions with clients. And as a result, we feel relatively confident that we can generate stronger revenue growth and probably more consistent with the type of sequential growth that we've seen in the past. And I think, Bryan, you know that usually pre-pandemic we sort of generated between 5% and 8% sequential growth throughout the year.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yeah, I would say, our assumptions -- because [indiscernible] you've got a general economic slowdown [indiscernible] And given the very specific trends in the case of EPAM, it's also in some way a reflection of this slowdown as well, because clients got comparably less work out, as they also got more optionality vis-a-vis others as well. So our assumptions right now, as we mentioned that probably this difficult situation would be for several quarters, and then demand will start to pick up and then we will measure this approximately in the terms which we consider pre-pandemic and in this situation [indiscernible] growth as we do. And with this, we think that again high-teens should be happen closer to the end of the year and potentially we will go to normal somewhere in the beginning of next year.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. My follow-up on margin here. So just within this margin outlook, can you talk about the degree to which lower growth impacted the year-over-year decline versus the global investments you're making to support diversification versus just normal pricing and wage pressures, just as you move to new lookout, trying to rank what are those three in this margin outlook. And, Jason, is there any structural change to the margin profile from here, just based on how you're seeing this play out?
Jason Peterson: Yeah. So I think the first thing is that, it's a little bit of a tale of two halves, where the first half is definitely lower profitability due to the unexpected lower level of demand. And so, you do just have lower utilization in the first half. And then as we said, we'll make certain that [indiscernible] appropriately matching cost to demand in the second half. Then I think the other piece, just on a year-over-year basis is, I do think that -- the pricing power that I think probably all of us saw over the last couple of years is going to be not quite as pronounced in 2023. And so price is going to be a little bit harder to come by. And at the same time, you have an awful lot of cost inflation around the world that is driving relatively high wage inflation. And so, I do think this year is going to be a different year where I think we've benefited from obviously strong price and, let's say, appropriate sort of wage inflation. I think this year, you're going to see still relatively high wage inflation and a little less opportunity on the price side. Structurally, Bryan, we've talked a lot about [indiscernible] into these new geographies, that over time we will sort of scale and optimize and that will improve profitability. I think, with the slowdown in demand, it's a little bit hard to make some of those changes to bring in more junior staff to improve off the relations that improve scale. And so I do think that as you move throughout the year, particularly as you enter 2024, there's greater opportunities, and generally I feel comfortable on our ability to continue to improve our profitability when we enter 2024.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. Thank you all the detail.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Maggie Nolan: Thanks very much. I'm curious what steps you're taking to revive the new business pipeline, given that with a secondary focus as you were adapting last year.
Jason Peterson: What we are doing to revive the pipeline.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. I think we kind of mentioned this, but in general, there is much better stability in our global operations which is giving us opportunity to focus on business. We were talking about our focus on consultants and this is working for us. We have new opportunities which is driven by this. But also we are working on a number of different models, specifically for this market today. And we talked about it even last time. So attention to sometimes shorter programs in [indiscernible] before. These are transformational programs, will be a [indiscernible] for our clients again. So multiple activities. I don't think it would be possible to kind of describe this in a couple of minutes. But we focus really to support new revenue generation right now from small deals to consulting-led deals as well.
Maggie Nolan: Okay. And then [Multiple Speakers]
Arkadiy Dobkin: So what I think important to mention here that we've definitely seen [indiscernible] good life at the markets there are large deals, where we are invited and we participate in right now, [indiscernible]. And most important, we do believe that the clients' confidence that we can continue even in this environment and given still not finished war is very, very different than it was at the beginning of the disruption when some of them started to consider alternatives. I think this situation changed. But, as you understand, every time there is a delay as we were really seeing the visible impact in Q4 and Q1 right now.
Maggie Nolan: Okay. And then you mentioned a top 10 customer -- top 20 customer that was slowing. Outside of those two, can you talk about the rest of the top client portfolio, how you see growth materializing with that base, or is there a level of caution there into 2023? And then any patterns emerging amongst those top customers in terms of where they'd like you to deliver from a geographic perspective?
Arkadiy Dobkin: That's another point that we are actually delivering now from very different geographies, and I think majority of the clients are comfortable. And again, there is no 100% of clients ready to work in occasions with the size of the portfolio we have today. We really don't have the problem from a geographies point of view, because there are clients working from different regions, and from this point of view, utilization, today it is well kind of balanced across the regions. At the same time, if you are talking about other trends in clients, then I will say that it's very much in line with everything else -- everybody else talking about it today, because there is a caution as there is a slowdown. There are some clients still growing fast, but again some decisions making much more slower. And some of them still delay. And on top of this, let's not forget, it is the mid of Q1. And Q1 in a normal year, there is no full kind of confirmation what will happen. I think in the next month or two, we will understand a little bit more about -- taking an account of this very special year, not only for EPAM. So I think the delays in decisions will be a little even one. But in general, the rest of the portfolio action for us, more in line with the -- kind of normal to the market.
Maggie Nolan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
James Faucette: Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to dig in just quickly a little bit on some of the comments Ark you and Jason have made around the relationships with your customers and the like. I'm wondering what levers right now you're looking to pull or can pull to reengage and maybe rebuild some of the relationships, and more specifically, the work streams? And should we expect any changes to pricing or delivery strategy in response to kind of those client dynamics?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I will reply, of course, obviously, in general terms. I think we are watching what's happening in real-time. And for specific clients for specific deals, we are actually making sometimes real-time decisions as well, because again there are two trends we are clear about. There is a general situation on the market and there are some specifics to EPAM. And specifics still will withstand here, but on another side, due to the last 12 months we probably make our clients feel much more comfortable, our ability to overcome the challenge. You could imagine [indiscernible] due to the first couple of months after the war started, or even when it was destruction in Ukraine in infrastructure and we kind of overcome all of these challenges that Ukraine has delivered. So I think we mentioned that thousands of people have moved and they [indiscernible] because we don't have complaints. But clients clearly were expecting some problems. We are saying right now that this is probably behind of us. While the challenge is still there. So when you say rebuilding the trust with the client, I think, let's put caution kind of there.
Jason Peterson: Yes. And I'll just comment on the pricing. And so, as I said, the environment is probably a little less -- there's little less opportunity for price improvement. And clearly, we're going to go off and make certain that we're able to sort of win opportunities, but at the same time, we're still working on pricing and we're certainly going to make certain that we don't do anything that would impair profitability over the long term.
James Faucette: Thank you for that. And then quickly just on capital allocation, how are you thinking about acquisitions, especially given the buyback authorization, and what are you looking for in acquisitions and what's the current landscape and pipeline for potential deals? Thanks.
Jason Peterson: Sure. So similar to the comments that Ark made around where our priorities were in 2022, that would also be consistent for our acquisition activity. We had other priorities. And so the aggressive pursuit of acquisitions was somewhat de-prioritized. At the same time, we have continued to be active through due-diligence. Sometimes we've sort of disqualified potential opportunities. And so, what I said in my prepared script really is consistent with, we believe that we can do pretty active acquisitions and also pursue a share buyback. And so, we do expect to be active throughout 2023, certainly a lot more active than we were in 2022. And I would say that generally the same sort of focus. So things that are probably somewhat more sort of consulting kind of oriented, maybe things that have a platform flavor to them. And we're tending to see a fair bit of growth in Continental Europe. And so, we'll clearly continue to look for opportunities to drive growth in that region as well.
James Faucette: Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Surinder Thind: Good morning. I think in your prepared commentary you talked about potentially seeing some green shoots. So just as a clarification, are you seeing that clients are a bit more optimistic now than they were in December and January? And I guess, if that's the case, what kind of gives you comfort around maybe growth in the back half of 2023, given some of the challenges of maybe forecasting demand in the near term or the changes in demand that you've seen in the near term from clients?
Jason Peterson: I'll start at the front end of that, because I was the one who introduced the green shoot language, and that was in response to an earlier question. And so, David and I do sort of our own channel checks internally with the business units. And so that commentary, Surinder, was based on a number of conversations that we've had with business unit heads. And so you see, even in consumer goods, hopefully, retail will also return with a little bit of strength in the retail sector. So we are seeing clients begin to come back and look for work. I specifically said in my prepared remarks that even the client who sort of had to ramp down between Q3 and Q4 is beginning to ask for new teams. And so, there's just a whole series of kind of anecdotes, or more than one or two. And then maybe Ark, you want to talk about what we're seeing in terms of larger deal opportunities and RFPs and that sort of thing.
Arkadiy Dobkin: As I mentioned, we've seen [indiscernible] that are opportunities. There is very active work with our business development and the sales team right now. There are some deals in probably some regions which we are participating in the process as well. So when you are asking about how confident we are about the guidance right now and how have we calculated, I think I was trying to address this already, but we are definitely working through multiple assumptions. And how good is transaction, this is a different question, because if you think about 2020, 2021 and 2022, so each time it was a very different situation in the last three years where there's a lot of news to the market. And results were really different than people expected at the beginning of the year. But versus assumptions, I think I feel that situation -- now development efforts will be similar to what it is right now, including aggression in Eastern Europe. So we assume that we will be maturing our delivery and pricing structure across new locations which we entered within the next quarters. We assume that demand will grow stronger in the second part of the year, based on our, again, assumptions that what we were seeing before, maybe slowdown in technology, usage of [indiscernible] relatively fast comeback, because as we've mentioned in the current world, new companies will be coming and bringing new technology, and the traditional [indiscernible] status quo, and started to invest very greatly despite of various events. And we saw it during the pandemic time. And again, we are absolutely a country that is not good with this type of growth, but it will be coming back. I think the combination of these assumptions and our ability to come where we're standing right now in Q1 should lead us to the number which we shared with you.
Surinder Thind: That's helpful. And as a follow-up here, can we maybe talk about the delivery footprint cost? Obviously, your global deliveries changed over the past year, the average cost of delivery has gone up. How should we think about that from a structural perspective? It seems like some of the competitive edge that you may be had in the past from maybe lower-cost talent in Eastern Europe, has that gone at this point, or how should we think about that from a competitive standpoint, the cost of your new delivery footprint and what clients think of it?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think that's a question which -- or that's a challenge which we are working right now. We are still in Eastern Europe that we -- over aggression in many countries inside of EU, but also outside of EU. At the same time, like the fastest growth in headcount happened in India and Latin America. So this is two new countries now which are, I mean, organic fast growth, because we have kind of some countries which is growing fast, but because of the allocation impact. So is in Latin America, this is a organically growing and we will be focusing on these regions. Plus, we have in our portfolio right now across Central and Western Asia, a number of regions which we do believe will be cost-competitive, and at the same time with a level of talent comparable and in line with general EPAM requirements. So I think it's a little bit moving target, but that's exactly what we simply will be able to manage in the next quarters as well.
Surinder Thind: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is now open.
David Grossman: Thank you. Good morning. I'm wondering if you could -- looking at the 2023 guide, perhaps you could break it down in terms of the headwinds that you're experiencing from geographic diversification concerns among your clients' demand and lower benefit from rates.
Jason Peterson: And David, are you talking about in terms of revenue growth or profitability or...
David Grossman: Yeah, Jason, revenue growth, just the revenue growth headwind from each of those three things, if you could break it down.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Let me clarify the question, was that breaking down between what -- breaking revenue [Multiple Speakers]
David Grossman: So on a year-over-year basis, the revenue growth headwind. I think we identified kind of three buckets, right? One was some clients concerns earlier in 2022 about geographic diversification, who initiated a process for that. There is a demand issue on a year-over-year basis, as result of slowing economic growth. And then third, the environment is creating less opportunity to get rates than what you would typically get. So I'm just wondering if you could help us understand the size of the headwind of each of those three dynamics on a year-over-year basis.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don't think we can speak specifics right now. I don't know, Jason, if you would be able to create some...
Jason Peterson: Yeah, a little bit complicated, David, because we still have probably some benefit in rate from the rate changes that we did as people moved geographies in the second half of 2022. And then, of course, that shows up in a full-year impact in 2023. But we think we'll see less, what I would call, traditional kind of pure rate in 2023. We moved into a lot of new geographies, as Ark talked about, Central and West Asia, which we think is an attractive location longer term. We probably still need to make certain that our clients are comfortable with the region in the same way that decades ago we had to get clients comfortable with Belarus. And so this is probably just some -- let's say, some timing lag [indiscernible] very comfortable with growing there.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yeah. David, I think it is very difficult to split between two things what you were talking about, some clients were [indiscernible] were counted on more growth in existing clients and we don't see this, and the cost factor as well. So I think calculation between these two, almost impossible because it's more distended and there is a trend between these versus specific calculation. So we definitely can't say how much we counted on couple of clients which changed their mind. But I don't think -- again, it's tens of million of dollars as well. That's all.
Jason Peterson: And then I just think I'll just sort of close David with, these are things that, obviously, we're working to address throughout 2023, and as Ark said, already the ability to sort of deliver from these new geographies, we feel that clients are comfortable -- clearly comfortable with our ability to generate -- to deliver from geographies that have been impacted in Eastern Europe. And then, as Ark talked about, we continue to sort of grow geographies that offer our clients very cost-competitive solutions. And, of course, we've got the high level of talent in geographies, might be a little bit more expensive, but are appropriate for specific clients need.
David Grossman: Got it. Fair enough. Thank you for that. And maybe just back, I think, to the question came up about supply in a couple of previous questions, but I'm just curious, as you look at these new geographies, can you share any information in terms of trends in utilization rate or churn and how we should think about that in each of these locations? I'm sure it's all over the board given there are new start-up operations. But just wondering if there's any observations about any of those dynamics as well, with just kind of your recruiting model in these new geographies and how that template is playing out for you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yeah. So it will be a question to go in details. So, yes, as I mentioned, 2022 was a big growth in India and Latin America. And so I'll start actually in those locations. It was a significant growth in 2021 as well. As you know, 2021 was a reasonably good year. And what -- so it was already proved in 2021. So it was like -- India was growing like -- I don't remember, 70%, 80%. And Latin America, probably in the same terms. Now it's 30%, 40% in India and even more in Latin America as well. So these regions, we are pretty comfortable. And yes, it's different from traditional, but we bring in there a lot of experience or expertise, how to build and grow within our status. And I think it's working. So this is one bucket. Another bucket, it's a number of locations where we have simultaneously bring in local talent and bring in experienced talent from other locations. And we started to -- knew it, as already mentioned previously, not only after the war started. It started actually in 2021. And we also feel comfortable that this has been in the quality results in line with what we experienced in kind of traditional EPAM locations as well. So now, definitely second part of 2022 was a very different trend than before. That's why when you were asking about practices, how are we hiring, what's the speed, how the Group is working? I think we are very comfortable that we will be able to speed it up, but we didn't need to speed it up. And I think we are much more diversified, and we have many more kind of tools right now, how to grow as soon as the growth will be there, demanded as before.
David Straube: So, operator, I think we are running a little bit late. We have time for one more quick question if we could.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Jason Kupferberg: Thanks, guys. I'll just ask a quick two-parter. I guess, of all the factors impacting the revenue growth in 2023, which really surprised you the most? And then can you just speak to the type of conservatism that you feel is in the revenue guide, in particular, because it does sound like you're incorporating these green shoots into the guide? There is some pretty big acceleration that you're building in between Q1 and Q4. Thank you.
Jason Peterson: Yeah. I think what we clearly saw in the month of January was slower demand, and specifically, obviously, further ramp-downs with a couple of clients that we had talked about in our prepared script. And so, just probably the entry point, Q1 2023, is kind of what changed, and in a couple of cases, it was specific to a few large customers. At the same time, we've stripped those two customers out. The dialog with our BUs is they sort of drive revenues and carefully evaluate their pipelines. But actually, there were some positive tonalities associated with it. And so the guide really does incorporate kind of the lower starting point, but obviously, four quarters is -- it's 12 months. So it's hard to predict exactly where you are going to end up in Q4, but it does already suggest that we're beginning to see an improvement in potential demand relative to that we saw in November, December and January and that's kind of what gives us the confidence in the guide. But at the same time, of course, we want to make certain that we'll be able to achieve the revenue guidance for the full year. So hopefully that answers that question.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I'd like to hand the conference back to Mr. Ark Dobkin for closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you as always for attending today's call. As you know, any questions, David is available to help. And talk to you in three months. Thank you.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-03 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by, welcome to the EPAM Systems Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
David Straube: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company’s third quarter 2022 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today’s call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. I’d like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today’s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company’s earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website. And now let’s turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. Let me begin today with a simple statement that we're very proud of everything EPAM achieved over our nearly three decades and that we are very thankful to the people who pass for their tremendous contribution over those years. And I would like also to add one more side, which feels very important to bring to the top of our conversation. Well, we you all know that the war in Ukraine is still dominating global headlines. And we are seeing this ripple effect across many sectors and geographies, for us as EPAM and many people around us. This war continues to be a very central part of our lives, deeply personal and the constant priority. With this, I would like to start with an update on our progress across our four phased approach, which we shared with you six months ago, back in May, as well as an update on some adjustments we are making as a result of newly available information. Our first phase, the safety of our employees and stabilization of our operations in Ukraine. The war has been ongoing for eight months already. Last time we met, we indicated that we thought that it was going to be longer than anybody was thinking when it began. And we all understand the situation continues to be very serious. And also, the safety is a very relative term for people, who is in Ukraine borders today. With all of that, we are constantly and proactively helping our employees, their families and the people of Ukraine as much as we can, but providing a wide range of support, including the regional allocations and all forms of local assistance, making it possible for our people, their families and often industry colleagues to continue to live and work in Ukraine. We are also continually developing ways to address new and unpredictable just yesterday challenges. And we are trying to also think proactively about what we can do today to make it easier and safer for tomorrow. As a result of that, we are working together across our all locations to maintain the highest level of service possible for our customers across all of our delivery locations within Ukraine. Even with the recent level of infrastructure instability, the productivity of our teams in country remains high, which make us believe that we can count on this level of resilience in our delivery operations, when we are sharing our guidance with the market today. Thank you to our Ukrainian team, and all the farmers for making this possible. It's simply just incredible. Thank you. Moving to our second phase, the acceleration of our global diversification effort and continued growth of our diverse capabilities. Over the last eight months, we have accelerated key parts of our global strategy in many ways accomplishing what we had planned to do over several years. Our delivery location and geographies become more and more balanced. Last quarter, we reported that impacted regions accounted for 40% of our time, while today this practically influence it from Russia, approximately 30% of our talent remains in the immediate regions. Something we plan to achieve closer to the end of this year. So our presence in Europe, outside of those regions in Central and Western Asia, India and Latin America are growing proportionally. In short, the adaptation of our business as a position of our delivery organizations is moving forward at unprecedented phase. We are very thankful to the many thousands of the farmers and their immediate families for their loyalty, trust and their decision to move to new country locations, while staying with and continue to work at EPAM. Well, it has been a complex undertaking. We are encouraging while overall levels of engagement and productivity we're seeing them now many new crops, and satellite locations. Many of those employees bring in years of experience, skills and knowledge with them, and are key to our global expansion efforts. And we had the safe, integrate and scale the globally resilient workforce now operating in more than 50 countries. Please note that during that time, we practically doubled the number of locations, which should enable us to establish additional lives, was means over 5,000 people tied in crops during the next few years. And some of these crops didn't do an executive form in February of 2022. As you can see, we are passionate about creating technology hubs and expanding our investment in many of geographies. As a result, our global delivery platform, in new ways of working should position us to become one of the most geographically balanced and value-added services company in the market. Moving to Phase 3 of continuing to serve and expand demand for our services for our growing global customer portfolio. And Phase 4, our focus and profitability, those two are very connected. We are working closely with our customers to reposition sizable portions of our program portfolio without disruption and impacting employees. And well, our business continuity programs create the necessary to plan for continued genesis and enable uninterrupted services quality. Our customer portfolio is now better diversified and more resilient, given the new level of engagement and new talent options. The two established a broader, more available partnership framework for us post the war. Today, we are staying close to our customers and working through different project plans and contingencies in what has become for us new normal. That also includes our efforts around coming back to the project levels that are in line with our historic numbers. As you can see we have some intermediate success in the direction already. While it is still too early to say that we are further calm the challenge to make it sustainable. On this topic of navigation unpredictable, I would like also to share here that during the recent Gartner Symposium on October, EPAM was a future case study on labor and global target resiliency, especially based on our efforts over the last eight months to adapt to provide safety to our people and assistance with relocations. And so continually investing in our capabilities and future growth, while navigating the unpredictable. We believe that most of the efforts highlighted by Gartner have put us onto a new trajectory or establishing foundation, if you will, that will position EPAM for continued future growth and market differentiation. Here, I would like to mention three more on top of what we have already shared. Progress in EPAM continuing our integrated consulting portion, which opens new market entry points and extend the depth and breadth of our existing relationship with customers to cover even more strategic set of buyers in our portfolio, also reflected by our increased onsite production with [indiscernible], which is now 13.6%, the highest in our system. Furthering our ecosystem partnerships enabled by our product and platform resilient heritage and new scale and market to bring them in relevant solutions to customers facing increasingly complete business and technology environments. Lastly, significantly investing on our educational platforms, which keeps our employees on the cutting-edge and allow us to attract and work to develop and deploy global talent for EPAM, as well as offer composable education services to our customers. In a more simple way, with all above efforts, we are very focused on maintaining our engineering and technology advantage and reputation across all our new and already established locations. Yes, we do understand that it is exactly one of the key questions you as investors and all our clients are asking today. And also probably about our ability to continue moving higher in the value chain, something we started 10-years ago and what we're very eager to continue doing now and in the future, proving to the market that we would be able to navigate the next transformation of EPAM to be able to offer to our clients something, which is rare in the market; strategy and implementation simultaneously and at scale and doing that better than most of our competitors can. With that, let's talk a bit about our Q3 results, while Jason will share as always the full level of detailed write-up. In the third quarter, EPAM delivered $1,230 million in revenues, a 24% year-over-year growth and non-GAAP per share of $3.10, a 30% increase over Q3 2021. I think, it's important to mention that in constant currency terms and with proper adjustment on discontinued revenue in Russia, that growth would be about 35%. Also during this quarter, the company generated $234 million of free cash flow and now has approximately $1.5 billion of cash on hand. We are proud and grateful to all our teams for continuously managing the business at this level, while responding to constant pressure to plan and execute a large number of tactical adjustment in an increasingly complete global geopolitical and economic environment, and especially thankful to our teams in Ukraine. As you have likely heard during the last month, some of our partners and customers have been messaging the expectation for a global slowdown in demand, and they result in actions to better align their businesses to this new environment. So for us, while the demand environment continues to be active across a number of our end markets, including planned second half transformational programs, products, platform development and modernization efforts in addition to the opportunities triggered from the recent acquisitions, we can confirm that there has been an increasing focus of programs that are tied to driving the short-term cost savings, other OpEx efficiencies and growth range of optimization programs. For each EPAM is also properly positioned today. Still, even with all confidence that our services remain highly relevant and in demand, we are beginning to see signs of growth level for that. So while we are taking steps to moderate our hiring spend in response, we are also reminded of previous downturns, out of which we grew at unprecedented rate. As such, we are working to carefully equilibriate our supply and demand outlooks to capture the demand up since when it returns, as we did it in the past. As we wrap up 2022, we believe that we will have contained the initial impact of the war within the fiscal year, including the discontinuation of our operations in Russia. But overall, we know that we are still in the middle of ongoing crisis in Ukraine. And unfortunately, it doesn't seem that right now it will be possible to contain the full imapct of the world just within 2022, as we have previously talked. What has changed over the past three quarters is that, when we say we can and will adjust our operations, we are confident that under circumstances, we can do so reliably and quickly. And exactly that for us is a very important confirmation, that after almost 30-years of our existence, after 10-years of being a publicly traded company and after becoming a S&P 500 member, we still can demonstrate our strong entrepreneurial DNA and we still can benefit from it by acting as a startup, as it ensures our ability to adapt and to grow further there. While for the current time, we are still playing for different types of mitigation scenarios in response to ongoing war, events to protect EPAM and our employees, who remain in the region. Nonetheless, we are confident that the steps we have taken to reposition and diversify the company have created an even stronger foundation for future growth, as we focus on EPAM as a $10 billion company, very much in line with what we’ve shared with you in early 2022 before the [indiscernible]. Now let me turn the call over to Jason, who will talk about our Q3 results and additional perspective as we look at Q4 and beyond.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. Before covering our Q3 results, I wanted to remind everyone that in addition to our customary non-GAAP adjustments, expenditures-related to EPAM's humanitarian commitment to Ukraine, the exit of our Russian operations and costs associated with accelerated employee relocations have been excluded from non-GAAP financial results. We've included additional disclosures specific to these and other related items in our Q3 earnings release. In the third quarter EPAM delivered another set of strong results across both top and bottom line, in addition to strong cash flow generation. During Q3, EPAM generated revenues of $1.23 billion, a year-over-year increase of 24.1% on a reported basis and 29.8% in constant currency terms, reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of 570 basis points. Additionally, the reduction in Russian customer revenues resulting from our decision to exit the market had a 470 basis point negative impact on revenue growth. Adjusting for the exit of our Russian operations, reported revenue growth would have been approximately 29%. Looking at the performance of our industry verticals in geographic regions in the quarter, growth was negatively impacted by the ongoing exit of our Russia operations and the effective foreign exchange on our U.S. dollar reported results were helpful, I'll provide an adjusted year-over-year comparison. Beginning with our industry verticals, travel and consumer grew 41.9%, driven by strong organic growth, primarily from our retail customers, as well as revenue contributions from recent acquisitions. Life Sciences and Healthcare grew 35% with strong growth coming from the healthcare industry in addition to growth in Life Sciences. Financial Services grew 10.4% with growth coming from asset management, banking and to a lesser extent in insurance. Excluding our Russia customers, growth would have been 25.4% and 29.9% in constant currency. Business information and media delivered 20.8% growth in the quarter, driven primarily by customers in the business information industry. Software and high-tech grew 17.8% in the quarter, and finally, our emerging verticals delivered 26.6% growth, driven by clients in energy, manufacturing and automotive. Excluding our Russia customers, growth was 29.5% or 39.4% in constant currency. From a geographic perspective, America is our largest region representing 61% of our Q3 revenues grew 26.3% year-over-year or 27.7% in constant currency. EMEA, representing 36% of our Q3 revenues grew 35.3% year-over-year or 50.3% in constant currency. EMEA performance was driven by strong organic growth combined with an incremental contribution from recent acquisitions. CEE representing 1% of our Q3 revenues contracted 77.2% year-over-year or 80.2% in constant currency. Revenue in the quarter was impacted by our decision to exit Russia and the resulting ramp down of services to Russia customers. And finally, APAC grew 10.5% year-over-year or 15.4% in constant currency terms and now represents 2% of our revenues. In Q3, revenues from our top 20 clients grew 22% year-over-year, while revenues from clients outside our top 20 grew 25%. Moving down the income statement, our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 32.6%, compared to 33.9% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 34.4%, compared to 35.1% for the same quarter last year. Compared to Q3 2021, gross margin in Q3 of 2022 reflects the negative impact of lower utilization, as well as the benefit from foreign exchange and the positive impact of a more normalized expense related to variable compensation. In Q3 2021, expense related to variable compensation was unusually high, based on the strong bottom line and extremely strong top line performance during that year. Q3 2022 was also negatively impacted by the timing difference associated with EPAM's ongoing efforts to align bill rates based on employee relocations. However, we have made better progress adjusting rates than originally anticipated. As a result, the negative impact on profitability was more limited than originally expected. GAAP SG&A was 16.1% of revenue, compared to 17.1% in Q3 of last year and non-GAAP SG&A came in at 14.1% of revenue, compared to 15.3% in the same period last year. SG&A performance in the quarter reflected a lower level of cost related to both variable compensation and facilities and also includes a positive benefit of foreign exchange. GAAP income from operations was $180 million or 14.7% of revenue in the quarter, compared to $144 million or 14.6% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $232 million or 18.9% of revenue in the quarter, compared to $180 million or 18.2% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Q3 non-GAAP income from operations reflects a lower level of variable compensation and a positive impact from foreign exchange, offset by a lower level of utilization. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.4%, primarily driven by excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits was 23.1%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $2.63, reflecting a $0.68 or 34.9% increase year-over-year. GAAP EPS includes the impact of the Ukrainian humanitarian expenditures, expenses related to accelerated staff relocation and costs related to the planned exit of our Russian operations. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $3.10, reflecting a $0.68 increase or 28.1% growth over the same quarter in 2021. In Q3, there were approximately $59.4 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q3 was $252 million, compared to $206 million in the same quarter of 2021. Free cash flow was $234 million, compared to free cash flow of $185 million in the same quarter last year. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. At the end of Q3, DSO was 69-days and compares to 71-days for Q2 2022 and 70-days for the same quarter last year. In Q4, we traditionally experienced a further improvement in DSO and expect a similar result this year. Moving on to few operational metrics we ended the quarter with more than 53,900 consultants, designers and engineers, a year-over-year increase of 14.5%. Our total headcount for Q3 was more than 60,250 employees, compared to Q2, we saw a net decrease of approximately 1,000 thousand headcount. The net decrease in headcount is a result of the reduction in Russia based headcount combined with a lower level of hiring across the organization, due to better than expected productivity in Ukraine and with a focus on moving utilization towards higher levels. Utilization was 73.5%, compared to 77.1% in Q3 of last year and 78% in Q2 2022. Utilization continues to be impacted by the war in Ukraine. Now let's turn to our business outlook. As we've done in previous quarters, let me provide some context that is informing our guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect a solid demand environment, including demand for programs, helping clients drive additional revenue, modernization and optimization. In a few cases in the retail and consumer space, we are seeing signs of moderation in demand due to delays in decision-making or additional screwed neon program budgets. As certain customers become more cautious regarding shifts -- shifting demand in their end markets. As a reminder, the exit of our Russian operations and the reduction in Russia customer revenues produces a tougher year-over-year revenue comparison, particularly in Q4, which has generally been a seasonally strong quarter in Russia. To-date, our operations in Ukraine have not been materially impacted by the recent escalation of the tax, and our teams remain highly focused on maintaining uninterrupted production. Our guidance assumes that we will continue to be able to deliver from our Ukraine delivery centers and productivity levels at or somewhat lower than those achieved in Q3 and consistent with our experience in the month of October. Through September 30, EPAM has spent more than $39 million as part of the company's $100 million humanitarian commitment to our Ukranian employs and the families. We expect further humanitarian expenditures will be made in Q4 and during 2023. Now moving to our Q4 2022 outlook, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.220 billion to $1.230 billion, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 11% on a reported basis and 15% in constant currency terms, both at the midpoint of the range. Included in these growth rates is approximately 100 basis points of revenue attributed from acquisitions closed over the last 12-months. Additionally, the ramp down of Russian customer revenues due to our decision to exit this market has a negative impact reducing our expected revenue growth rate by approximately 500 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 12% to 13% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 21% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation to be approximately 23%. Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.02 to $2.10 for the quarter. And non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.62 to $2.70 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of $59.6 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions have supported our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements in the fourth quarter. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $33 million. Amortization of intangible sales is expected to be approximately $5.7 million. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be negligible. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $9.6 million. And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $4.3 million in the quarter. In addition to these customary GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments inconsistent with the prior quarters in 2022, we expect to have ongoing non-GAAP adjustments Q4, resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Please see our Q3 earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP guidance. Our fourth quarter outlook reflects a solid demand environment combined with improving operating performance allowing EPAM to return to its traditional 16% to 17% adjusted IFO range sooner than anticipated. Although we still face ongoing challenges, this is a significant achievement given the amount of descriptions that company is managing through as a result of the war in Ukraine. We will continue to closely manage the operations of EPAM, while remaining a tenant to any changes in the demand environment. Lastly, I'd like to thank our employees for their continued dedication and focus on our customers. Operator, let's open the call up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Bryan Bergin: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thank you, I hope your colleagues remain safe here. Just first, I was hoping you could just dig into more on the detail on how you're forecasting that 4Q growth. Just as we consider a 30% adjusted rate of growth on a constant currency organic basis this past quarter and we try to bridge that to the implied level in 4Q. Can you just talk about some of the puts and takes you factor there? Is it really just a combo of lower utilization and some macro uncertainty on demand?
Jason Peterson: Yes. I mean, I think, there's a few things. First, there is a decline in revenues associated with bill days, so it's just the natural algebra of there are fewer bill days in Q4 than there are in Q3. And that would net-net would kind of actually reduce revenue by 2% between Q3 and Q4 it gives all things else were held equal. At the same time, I think that we continue to feel good about the growth that we’ve generated in Q3 and I think the other thing Bryan to point out is that we have the same impact on our growth rate from the exit from Russia, so we had a $50 million Q4 last year and we'll have a single-digit -- mid to low single-digit Russian revenue contribution in Q4 of this year. So it's a combination of those two things. And then again, we continue to see growth -- we continue to see spending and investments on the part of our clients, but it's probably at a somewhat lower growth rate than we have experienced earlier in the year.
Bryan Bergin: Okay, okay. And then on the delivery footprint on understanding how the Russia exit this quarter that really impacted that workforce level? Can you just comment on your comfort levels ramping in these other regions? And are there any notable changes in the delivery mix plan that you expect to exit this year at?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So Bryan, I think, we’re kind of illustrating that we were talking like a couple of quarters ago about our -- I think balance in our delivery capacity. We actually exactly on the plan or on progression a little bit. And I think by the end of the year, probably a couple more percentage points we’ll be down from impacted regions, which means that, we're continuously building our operations in Western, Central Asia and India and North America as well. But right now it's all balanced out. Again, inside of the company, probably we will go from current 30%, 31% to 27%, 28% trends in the positive future.
Bryan Bergin: All right. Thank you, guys.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is now open.
David Grossman: Good morning and thank you. Just a couple of quick follow-up questions about some of the comments that you made about the dynamic between, if you look at the quarter, you had a sequential decline in headcount. You beat the revenues modestly yet margins performed with utilization down. You mentioned rate, is there anything else that kind of helps to reconcile all those different variables with the outcome?
Jason Peterson: Yes, there's a couple of different ways to look at this. From a pricing standpoint associated with the realignment of pricing for the relocation of employees, we did better than we expected. So we had expected that to have a more negative impact on profitability in Q3 than it actually did. However, on a year-over-year basis, that wouldn't really show up as a benefit. What we saw was a couple of things, we are getting some benefit from foreign exchange, so foreign exchange is obviously having a negative impact on revenue growth rate. But we have a number of countries in which we deliver from where the currencies obviously have devalued more substantially than the devaluation of the euro or the pound. And so, that's had a somewhat positive impact on profitability on a year-over-year basis. Then the other thing, which I tried to call out in the script is that we had an enormously successful year last year relative to expectations, which drove a higher variable compensation cost. And this year where we're effectively, sort of, booking a bonus, if you will, at 100%. It's lower than it would have been last year. And so, last year, I guess, you could say we would have been even more profitable. And this year, we're sort of booking at a more consistent level of variable compensation based on our performance. So I'm not certain if that gets to the part of it, but foreign exchange would definitely be one of the things that's a positive.
David Grossman: Right. And you had said, Jason, I think last quarter that you expect to get to more normalized margins in the first quarter obviously, next year, and you've obviously, kind of, exceeded that this quarter. As you think about next year and you kind of eliminate some of this noise, is kind of a 17%. I know you don't want to give guidance since earlier in the year, but I guess I'm just trying to get a sense, are you still comfortable with that? Comment of getting back to normalized margins and sustaining that next year? Has anything changed?
Jason Peterson: Yes, so I think that if I remind, I said, we get -- we expect to get back towards, right, which is -- and right now, I feel actually that the company has done a phenomenal job with not only the profitability in Q3, but also the guide getting back to the 16% to 17% in Q4. And part of that has to do with all the work we've done on the geographic transformation and the realignment of rates. But I think it's too early right now to talk about what profitability could be in 2023, just because there's still a lot of moving pieces with what's going on in -- with the war and some other things. But I definitely am encouraged by the fact that we've generated such a strong level of profitability in Q3, and again our confidence in being able to guide to 16% to 17% in Q4.
David Grossman: Right, and just one last one, if I could. In the demand environment, you give us a good insight into kind of how that informed your fourth quarter guidance. And you called out, I thought, consumer. Any other verticals that you're seeing similar dynamic? Are you just anticipating based on qualitative commentary from your customers that they're planning for a slowdown beyond the consumer vertical? Just any more color you can give us there would be very helpful.
Arkadiy Dobkin: David, your wishing and reading exactly what we do. And in general, I think, I don't know if you use noise as kind of qualifier, but there are enough messagings on the market that many industries are very careful right now and seems like, of course, saving priority becoming number one versus transformation. That's at least what we've seen. It's not necessarily seen in the market from specific actions across the industries. But I think it would be fair to assume that retail probably usually reacting much faster, sometimes much faster recoveries as well, that's what we saw in 2021. But some other you’ll fall and I think it wouldn't be surprised. So I think everybody much more careful, obviously, in compared to just several quarters ago.
David Grossman: Okay, great. Very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Darrin Peller: Thanks, guys. When thinking about where we are now in terms of the transformation you wanted to be in by the time -- by this time in the year around Russia, and all the sourcing in the labor side and the relocating. Could you just give us a quick update in terms of the percentages more you still have to go to finalize plans on that front? And when we think about the new geographies, obviously, you talked about how pricing in those new markets is helping the revenue side to some degree versus the headcount growth. But I'm curious what you expect your headcount growth capabilities to be from here just being in some of these new markets?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think in terms of plans, we kind of shared pretty detailed plans during our Investor Day. I think, we're very much on target with this plan, at the same time, as you understand, each month, not even talking about quarter, but sometimes each week making some adjustments to this. So at this point, we do believe that we do in a recent possible based on the real-time information happening and at large our plans still stays the same. So we're going to become probably the most balanced from delivery perspective company in our sectors. And we’re very strongly looking how we grow it and going to develop talent market across new for us [indiscernible]. So it's all in plan, and that's very much moving forward. So what else we will be necessary -- we'll be doing if different type of scenario will be developed, we have answers for this, I don't think we will be saying in all details, but we have plans for this. But I guess, right now, we're going practically with the same plan, which we shared and we're very much on target for this, which we shared on Investor's Day.
Jason Peterson: Yes, so we feel quite good about our ability to add headcount in the regions in which we're currently expanding in Latin America and India and in other geographies outside of what we call the impacted region. And so, I think, we’re very much can respond to future upticks in demand and again, feel comfortable with our ability to continue to generate growth in excess of 20% based on available demand. Okay, right now, there's a little bit more focus on taking up utilization again. And so, that's kind of what you see around the headcount additions.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. So the question was, you will feel comfortable that we will be able to find the right talent in new locations. Then the short answer, yes. Right now, we even more comfortable that we were a couple of quarters ago, because now we have much more experience in terms of how to do it as we understand how to reapply the experience, which we developed during our growth in our kind of comfortable zone in Eastern Europe, that is very much applicable to new locations as well.
Darrin Peller: Just thanks. Just very quickly, when you think of the macro and the demand environment for a minute, I mean, it's pretty clear that companies are taking a little bit longer to make decisions, but for the right technology, the demand is still very high. Have you seen a shift to cost takeout plans or efficiencies by your clients yet? Or is it still very much focused on -- like digitization and differentiation competitively in other projects like it?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I would characterize this like if two, three quarters ago, the growth and so as always, I think, collectively, whatever people mean by digital transformation and growth sense of this. It was absolutely number one priority. I think, right now, it's very much balanced with cost savings and what will be tomorrow, I think, it's visible. So it's pretty balanced from our point of view. Digital transformation is still there and its still one of the two priorities, but it's now one of the two.
Darrin Peller: Understood. All right. Thanks guys.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is now open.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. And good quarter, guys. I wanted to just kind of take a peek at the planning assumptions as you're going through that process for next year? And as we think in terms of granular modeling. Again, not asking for guidance, but how are you thinking of the setup for next year in terms of the underlying demand for digital transformation? Obviously, Q1 is a tough comp for things like that. Could you just walk through your thought process as you do your own budgeting?
Jason Peterson: We're in the midst of it today, and so we -- the standard process that we would use where we've got kind of an aspirational model and then a very detailed account level planning, and we're beginning to get feedback from each of the business units as to kind of what they're expecting at the account level. Then as you can imagine, we sort of consider the investment priorities and all of that, and we come back with a guide in terms of both revenue growth and profitability. And so, clearly, we're not at a stage yet where I can talk about that based on where we are in the planning cycle and we're also not guiding to 2023, but I will provide some color on the revenue growth. And so, as we've talked about, we do expect that we will return to a rate of growth greater than 20% at some point in the future. At this time, based on what I'm seeing with our numbers, I would not expect that to occur in the first half of the 2023 fiscal year. And instead, I think that would be more likely to occur sometime in the second half.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Understood. Got it and thank you for that. The other question I had was, obviously, as we see everybody else's results coming through, a lot of weakness in the high-tech vertical? How does that affect, sort of, your thinking in terms of -- thinking or expectations in terms of your own client base and the work you're doing? And are you beginning to see any specific impact in that or other verticals?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Ashwin, I think that we already kind of brought color on this, that in general, everybody much more cautious than before. And I think, I don't think like to loudly say this, like you open any media as everybody talking about it. And there is no very clear sign what would happen, but again, everybody much more careful in making decisions. And it's not only in the retail, retail react in much weaker in consumer reaction as well. The rest of this pretty stable right now, but again, slower from gross point of view, definitely slow.
Jason Peterson: So we still see spending, we still see investment on the part of clients. Just the rate of growth appears to be somewhat slower and some of the decision-making is a little bit slower.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And if you ask in like broader long-term, then I think, as any other relatively large company, we have a history of going through difficult times and we definitely analyze this. And in our specific case, we know that each time after this, it was time of big growth. And again maybe quiet situation was the closest illustration, if considered as a quiet or little slowdown. Again, it was for several quarters, we don't know. But then it was big, kind of, come back. Similar was in 2008, 2009 for us. And we'll learn our lessons how to navigate through this and how to go through this, to make sure that we save, and in Western is the very right part of the company to come work correctly, and that's what we're focusing. And in short, we talked about it already multiple times. Consulting integrated with engineering, we’ve building up this piece now at our work, and we understand how to scale up the talent. That's another area which we keep intact all the time. Even if numbers of headcount is slowing, the whole machine how to bring talent back, it's still running and we tuning this very carefully.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Appreciate that. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Ramsey El-Assal: Thank you for taking my question this morning. I had a question on the pricing environment. And it seems like there's some puts and takes. On the one hand, you have a lot of inflation, which might give you some air cover to pass pricing through? On the other hand, you're talking about some softening macro, maybe some caution on the side of your clients. Can you talk about the puts and takes in pricing and whether you're seeing any changes in the environment?
Jason Peterson: I think, what I would just comment on, on what we've seen, let's say, over the last maybe five months and then it's a little harder to predict as to what you might see in the future, but I could talk to kind of what we're expecting for Q4. One of the things that was a positive surprise from both revenue standpoint and profitability in Q3 was that, we were able to execute on our realignment of rates for all of the relocations that we've done to higher cost geographies. And so, we made better progress than expected. Already, I think that as we end Q3, we think that we've already got the realignment of about two-thirds of the positions that have been shifted to other geographies. We still have ongoing work to do there. And also, we still are relocating people from countries to higher cost countries, but we do expect to continue to see price improvement associated with realignment. And then in addition, there are probably -- is some additional pricing, kind of, going on in the second half of the fiscal year. Hard to postulate, kind of, what could happen next year. Certainly, in the environment that we've been in where there's been very high demand and some disconnect between supply, that's supportive of pricing discussions and we'll have to see what pricing discussions look like in 2023.
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay, great. And one last one for me, a question on M&A and similar overlay with the sort of macro cycle. In past cycles, do you guys pull back on deal activity as the macro environment gets a little choppier? Or instead is it the opposite where you maybe see some opportunities that weren't around when times were better? How do you think about M&A in that context?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don't think we were like adjusting our M&A activities based on specific like economic climate environment. I think, we were looking for the right additions all the time and we continue doing this today as well. And I think it might be a better opportunity for us in a couple of quarters from pricing point of view. But in general, yes, we consider that we’re working on this and it's not happening right now, largely because we don't see the right things. But definitely, we have -- maybe with everything else, yes, we have some other priorities before this. But again, there is no specific slowdown or the M&A.
Ramsey El-Assal: Got it. All right. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
James Faucette: Thanks very much, a couple of follow-up questions for me. Jason going back to kind of your outline for 2023, I think, it makes sense, particularly given the comps that you faced with Russia and its contribution at least in the early part of the first half of this year. Are there other drivers or things that we should keep in mind as you think about like that, kind of, return to 20%-plus growth in the second half of the year? And kind of what are your planning assumptions are you looking at? New capacity coming online. Delivery capacity coming online? Or just how you're thinking about kind of the evolution of the current demand environment, just any incremental color on what's leading you to kind of think about that cadence?
Jason Peterson: Yes, you're right that we would have still generated significant revenues from Russia, particularly in Q1 of 2022. So that will be a tougher comp. We still think foreign exchange is going to have some headwind associated with it. And then, I think there's -- right now, we continue to sort of evaluate the demand environment as we've talked about. But I just think the other thing is that, if you look at our headcount additions over the last couple of quarters is that, oftentimes you need to have, sort of, ongoing sequential growth to them continue to sort of produce strong year-over-year growth two or three quarters out. And so, we feel very comfortable with our ability to add headcount over time. And again, as Ark talked about, we feel that we've got increasing, sort of, operational experience in the newer geographies. And right now, I just think as I kind of look at the numbers and the likely headcount adds this quarter, it just appears that your trajectory would, sort of, give you the opportunity for a greater than 20% growth in the second half rather than in the first half. And I think, you guys probably do the same types of math that we do, and you likely could see that as well.
James Faucette: Great. Appreciate that, Jason. And then the second part of my question is like -- and then I think it ties a little bit into what you were saying around employees and where you're adding heads geographically. But I think you had made the comment about wanting to increase utilization, et cetera. Is it right to assume that you're probably running higher utilizations in your more established geos, including maybe those that are impacted still by the war in the Ukraine? And that the improvements in utilization are likely to come primarily from the newer geographies? Or is there more nuance than that?
Jason Peterson: Yes, it would be mix. So we're definitely running with lower utilization and what I'll call the impacted sort of geographies. But there's also some opportunity for us to tighten up utilization in some of the newer geographies that we've expanded into. And so, again, the goal in Q4 would be somewhat improved utilization, but still maybe a little below our target. And then, as we enter the first half of next year is to make certain that we're continuing to focus on improved utilization.
Arkadiy Dobkin: But in general, what you asked, James, it is correct, because in new locations we have new people and utilization at the beginning of this area is still below. And in quarter two, it will be improved, because it will be stable at, but yes.
James Faucette: That's great. Thanks, Ark. Thanks, Jason.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. I'd like to start with a question about just, kind of, the delivery footprint that you have at this point. Can you maybe talk about the level of comfort that clients actually have with the current exposure to the region? So are they expecting you to maintain backup in case of further disruptions? Are they taking on some of the risk? How should we think about that balance that you have with clients at this point?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Surinder, basically question -- how well the making happening between what locations, clients leading to consider and where we're growing right now from talent point of view, correct?
Surinder Thind: Well, more about the idea that right now, I think the target is to have 30% of your delivery from the exposed regions where the war is, right? Is there an opportunity to further reduce that? Or it seems like clients are comfortable with that level of risk? And so, how should we think about -- do you have to make feedback in terms of clients, if there is further disruption? Or how should we think about you guys managing to this new global delivery footprint, like why not reduce it further?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think that's a very dynamic parameter. And I think clients -- because the risk is a very dynamic parameter. And in general clients comfortable with it, but as soon as the risk will elevate then this distribution will be happening, that’s the main challenge that's what we're living through. And at this specific point, I think there is a kind of status quo is some concerns and what will be one month from now or two months from now, it's a little bit different things. Again, that's exactly the challenge on hand. But another side, we have multiple new locations and we have, as we mentioned a significant number of EPAMers, who move from one location to another and came to new locations, which kind of seems to accelerate the EPAM knowledge and quality standards and growing new locations. And also make clients comfortable in these new locations, because some good concentration of people they already know moved there. So from this we’re managing the whole as a rebalancing of the talent. But right now, we have 30%, and it's people with pretty good level of utilization right now.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. And then as a follow-up, can you maybe talk little -- I understand there's been a lot of questions about demand, but can you maybe talk about the level of visibility that you have with customers? And what I'm trying to get here is, can you maybe talk about the rate that maybe projects are being delayed or canceled relative to historicals? And is there incremental risk in the sense that, once 2023 budgets get established, it's really then that clients have to make decisions. So maybe current conversations may be productive, but when it really the rubber hits the road, they're more hesitant to start projects. So just kind of trying to understand the risk in the numbers as it seems like some commentary from everyone else, things are just slowing faster than anticipated. And so, the question is why can't that continue?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think, our typical answer at this stage, it's too early to say, because it's kind of not even middle of Q4 and this is very, very true in any very normal year. With a kind of not what is a normal year, probably when I look into our revenue trends or the results of normal year the last time we saw probably at the end of 2019, which was a long time before COVID and before, then it was like being slowdown and a huge acceleration. Then in our case was started, but then the whole general economic trend like going different than we saw just six months ago probably, okay. So that's why like you're asking question, but even in normal year, we're not commenting on this. And this specific year, I don't think we can say like, it is very dynamic.
Surinder Thind: That's helpful. Thank you. That's it for me.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.
Jamie Friedman: Hi. Ark, in your prepared remarks, you called out the increase in the on-site composition, the highest in the company's history. So I just want to get some context on that, why now? And then, well, let me just start with that, any perspective. And then I had a question about the $10 billion comment as well, but how about the on-site first?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we're talking about EPAM continuing development as a brand. It practically didn't exist three years ago. Now that's in -- may which started to be recognized on the market and consultant field. So -- and with everything, specifically acquisition during 2019 or sorry, 2021, during the 2021, end of 2021, we were increasing this. And to support the new type of engagements, which we anticipate in and which we are doing already. So we actively were hiring in the market, so it's not specifically why now, it's just continuation of what's happening.
Jamie Friedman: Okay. Thank you. And then in terms of your comment about the $10 billion, I don't want to point to a specific time, but how are you thinking about that journey in light of everything that's going on, the $10 billion target?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So it's -- probably it is -- maybe sounds a little bit strange, especially taken exactly in account what's going on right now. But at the same time, while this is a very, very special situation and we will understand it, so all our experience from the past towards it is going to ramp in one quarter and in three quarters. On top of this, there is a potential economic slowdown I'm initially talking about it. If you think about our numbers during the last several quarters, based on economic environment, based on our competitors, if war wouldn't happen, these numbers might be consider it even normal. Not very much different from what others are showing, that I'm just bringing all this colors just to confirm that we're definitely looking into what's going to be with the next couple of quarters, so six months. But we're definitely looking at what we'll be here in two years or three years. And from this point of view $10 billion looks like a very realistic goal for us, still aspirational but realistic. Three years ago, probably $10 billion would be sounded very much aspirational. Right now, it's just a pragmatic target for us, that's all.
Jamie Friedman: Got it. Thank you. I'll jump back in the queue.
Operator: Thank you. I’d now like to hand the conference back over to Arkadiy Dobkin for closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, thank you very much for joining us today. Thank you for your support, which we are hearing from everybody. I think, it's important to one more time state that EPAM as a company, we're supporting Ukraine 100%. So we're very committed to our people in the country. We do believe that Ukraine will be part of our operation for many years. And while we're going through the difficult part, I think, we're still seeing a very bright future for EPAM and the growth. And we understand that it's a challenging time. So let’s talk in three months, and we'll see what's happening. And thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-05 08:00:00) =====
David Straube: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's second quarter 2022 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website. With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I want to start by reminding you of our earnings call three months ago and then our Investors and Analyst Day on May 19, when we shared our approach and higher-level plan for the following months. At that time, we said that we didn't expect the war to end quickly. And as a result, our plans for adapting the company were developing based on a series of overlapping efforts or phases. Today, we are still very much in the war time, and we don't fully see a definitive conclusion for it in the near term. That means that, as we expected, we are continually adjusting our operations, our delivery organization and ways of working to what is our new normal now. So let's go quickly by the progress we are making across those phases. The first phase is the focus of the safety of our employees and stabilization of our operations in Ukraine. At this time, all our employees are in safe locations, either within the country or in neighboring countries. And our teams continue to work supporting our customers at levels of productivity very much in line with what we experienced before the war or during war. In addition, in this new normal, we continue to support our Ukrainian employees and their families as well as the Ukrainian people. We are providing various forms of humanitarian relief with EPAM Ukraine Assistance Fund and our $100 million assistance commitment, which we have now done in March. I would just add that we are constantly moved by the resilience and morale of our Ukrainian employees, and we want to take one more opportunity to thank them for their incredible commitment and level of purpose they demonstrate. The second phase of our framework is acceleration of our global digitization efforts and continued growth of our diverse capabilities. And yes, this includes first of all geographical diversification of our delivery platform. But it also includes many other critical aspects of our operations and several key investments efforts, which ensures the quality of delivery while we are expanded rapidly across multiple tiers. We are located in already digital delivery locations in India, Latin America and Central Asia, as well as establishing several newly-created delivery hubs and expected many existing sites across Central and Eastern Europe and Western and Central Asia as well. This is also supported by the active redeployment of many of our current employees. We decided to explore opportunities outside of their home countries and simultaneously establishing a strong EPAM cultural foundation in those locations to further develop the local talent market and fastly grow its EPAM hubs. Looking at our global footprint. EPAM now serves customers from more than 50 countries around the world, which means we just doubled our country count in the last three years. And as a result, replenished our delivery platform across now four major geographies, which includes Central and Eastern Europe, India, Western and Central Asia and Latin America. Today's reach also didn't exist for us just a few years back. Today, with those efforts and accelerated growth outside of impacted regions, we have reduced our delivery capacity there from roughly 60% in February of 2022 to 40% now. And we expect to reach a level of close to 30% in to the second half of 2022. Part of this process, we are well underway in our commitment of our exiting our operations in Russia, where we moved quickly and anticipate completing the process shortly. We are still working through a number of regulatory requirements in the country, which means that the timing of full transition is still difficult to predict precisely. With that said, we can share that our local footprint went from over 9,000 people at the end of Q1 to just under 1,000 today. With that, I would like to say a big thank you to many people within EPAM global delivery and talent management and the financial organizations at very different seniority levels, who are enabling this massive talent transformation efforts across dozens of countries simultaneously and under very challenging timelines. Thank you. Moving to also phase in the framework. Continuing to serve and expand demand for our services for our growing global customer portfolio. Over the last five months, we have repositioned absolute majority of all client projects who requested their work to be relocated based on their sense of risk mitigation factors. As we also know, that such requests will continue to happen in the future depending on the different fast developing external factors. We just feel at this point, that we are much better prepared now to address such future needs. With this, I would like to state that while we continue to be extremely open and responsive to our customer needs and their preferences, we are seeing today some new incoming demand into the region and expect a significant proportion of our client portfolio, even with increased global diversification, to be continuously serviced from Ukraine and Belarus. Another indication of our success in our third phase could be expressed by the growth of our top 20 and top 50 client portfolio. Most of them have been with us and stayed with us through multiple phases of change and growth. And thanks to their support today during such a huge and terrible disruption due to current war in Ukraine. Finally, the last element of our framework is a focus on profitability, or Phase 4. As work has been repositioned to new geographies, we have begun the effort to align rate structures and optimize the performance of new delivery locations. This will continue throughout this year and into 2023. While still too early to provide specifics on our progress on this phase, we believe we will return to profit levels approaching EPAM's historical ranges during the first half of 2023. In addition to all of that, we continue to progress our investment agenda across several key areas. EPAM Continuum is now the consulting brand recognized by leading analysts and strongly supporting our growing focus on more complex and advisory led engagements. Our cloud and data offerings are progressing fast into large modernization programs, enabled by our strengthening relations with key partners in this space. And we continue to see traction with EPAM's efforts in our IP and educational initiatives as well as our advanced remote supply model, enabled by our continuously invented digital platforms. In short, we feel good right now about our progress to date, of rebalancing our global delivery and moving forward with all other additional initiatives. This should allow us to maintain the sequential constant currency revenue growth rate, despite the massive disruption we have encountered. With that, I would like to provide some comments on the current demand environment, or at least how we see it from our side. While we really are doing better today than we expected, we, like our competitors and all of you, see a growing number of mixed economic indicators and caution in the market. At the same time, we still believe the near-term demand environment remains intact. We also believe the medium-term broad-based demand trends, which have driven activity in our industry in the past will continue to support our ability to drive strong organic growth at or above our old normal 20% target. So while we are not immune to the impact of the global economic events, we shall being much better positioned today than in the past to address any future shifts. And we also believe EPAM remains well positioned for long-term growth and value creation opportunities, for our people, for our clients and for our investors. To summarize, our priority remains to contain, as much as possible, the impact of the current disruption of the war during 2022. We have made significant progress in this area over the last five months. And in addition, we are significantly accelerating key elements of our overall strategy. Because to big extent, other than the closing of our operation in Russia, what is happening right now and what we now call our new normal is very much the accelerated effort towards certain strategic directions, which have been part of our medium to longer-term plans. The resilience of our people, customers and operations have effectively created accepting this new normal for EPAM, an entirely different level of diversification, productivity and agility of the business to ensure future growth in this constantly changing market environment. So overall, these challenging times are helping us to build better and more adaptive EPAM, and faster. And in closing, as I mentioned on our Q1 earnings call, and it's worth repeating, EPAM as a company fully stands with Ukraine. Since the beginning of the war, our absolute top priority has been and continues to be the safety and well-being of our employees and their families. One more time, thank you to all of our employees for this effort and their loyalty during these not at all easy times. Now let me turn the call over to Jason, who will talk about our Q2 results and additional perspective as we look at Q3 and beyond.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, EPAM delivered another set of strong results, including a sooner-than-anticipated return to sequential revenue growth. These results were produced at a time when the company was experiencing unprecedented disruptions across all VPM's major delivery locations. As we mentioned during our Q1 earnings call, in addition to our customary non-GAAP adjustments, expenditures related to EPAM's humanitarian commitment to Ukraine, the exit of our Russian operations and costs associated with accelerated employee relocations have been excluded from non-GAAP financial results. We have included additional disclosures specific to these and other related items in our Q2 earnings release. During Q2, EPAM generated revenues of $1.19 billion, a year-over-year increase of 35.6% on a reported basis and 40.1% in constant currency terms, reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of 450 basis points. Looking at the performance of our industry verticals and geographic regions in the quarter. Growth was negatively impacted by the ongoing exit of our Russia operations and the effect of foreign exchange on our U.S. dollar reported results. Were helpful, I will provide an adjusted year-over-year conversion. Beginning with our industry verticals. Travel & consumer grew 61.1%, driven by strong organic growth, primarily from our retail customers as well as revenue contributions from recent acquisitions. Life sciences and healthcare grew 40.1%, with strong growth coming from the health care industry, in addition to growth in life sciences. Financial services grew 29.4%, with growth coming from asset management, payments and banking. Excluding our Russia customers, growth was 41.5% or 45.7% in constant currency. Business information & media delivered 25.4% growth in the quarter, driven primarily by customers in the business information industry. Software and hi-tech grew 22.7% in the quarter. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered 36.1% growth, driven by clients in telecommunications, energy, manufacturing and automotive. Excluding our Russian customers, growth was 40.6% or 49.1% in constant currency. From a geographic perspective, Americas, our largest region representing 60% of our Q2 revenues, grew 36.8% year-over-year or 37.9% in constant currency. EMEA, representing 35% of our Q2 revenues, grew 45.2% year-over-year or 58% in constant currency. EMEA performance was driven by strong organic growth, combined with the incremental contribution from recent acquisitions. CEE, representing 2% of our Q2 revenues, contracted 46.7% year-over-year or 58.2% in constant currency. Revenue growth in the quarter was impacted by the ramp down of services to our Russian customers. And finally, the APAC grew 20.8% year-over-year or 25% in constant currency terms and now represents 3% of our revenues. In Q2, revenues from our top 20 clients grew 27% year-over-year, while revenues from clients outside our top 20 grew 41%. Moving down to the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 29.2% compared to 33.8% in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 31.5% compared to 35% for the same quarter last year. Compared to Q2 2021, risk margin in Q2 2022 was negatively impacted by the ongoing transition of customer work to higher-cost geographies as well as lower utilization in Russia. GAAP SG&A was 19.5% of revenue compared to 17.2% in Q2 of last year. And non-GAAP SG&A came in at 15.2% of revenue compared to 15.6% in the same period last year. GAAP income from operations was $93 million or 7.8% of revenue in the quarter compared to $125 million or 14.2% of revenue in Q2 of last year. The lower level of profitability was primarily driven by costs associated with the exit of our Russian operations, relocation of our employees, and humanitarian expenditures and support for Ukrainian employees. Non-GAAP income from operations was $177 million or 14.9% of revenue in the quarter compared to $155 million or 17.6% of revenue in Q2 of last year. We are pleased with our operating profit in a quarter when the company was also executing a significant geographic transformation. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was negative 114.9%, primarily driven by excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation as well as a onetime deferred tax benefit associated with tax planning. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes the excess tax benefits as well as onetime benefit from tax planning, was 22.9%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $0.32, reflecting a negative $1.62 or 83.5% decrease year-over-year. GAAP EPS includes the impact of Ukraine and humanitarian expenditures, expenses related to accelerated staff relocations, costs related to the planned exit of our Russian operations and the FX impact of Russian ruble appreciation on the intercompany payables denominated in rubles and U.S. dollar-denominated assets held by our Russian entity. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.38, reflecting a $0.33 increase or 16.1% growth over the same quarter of 2021. In Q2, there were approximately 59 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q2 was $78 million compared to $69 million in the same quarter of 2021. Free cash flow was $59 million compared to free cash flow of $46 million in the same quarter last year. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. At the end of Q2, DSO was 71 days when compared to 69 days for Q1 2022 and 70 days for the same quarter last year. We expect to maintain DSO in and around this level throughout 2022. Now moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended the quarter with more than 54,850 consultants, designers and engineers, a year-over-year increase of 28.1%. Our total headcount for Q2 was around 61,300 employees. Compared to Q1, we saw a net decrease of approximately 300 headcount. Significant additions in India, Central Europe and Latin America were offset by the reduction of headcount in Russia. Utilization was 78% compared to 80.2% in Q2 of last year and 78.4% in Q1 2022. Our Q2 utilization includes those employees who have been assigned in a backup capacity to support projects substantially delivered from Ukraine. Although these employees were accounted to utilize for the purpose of our utilization calculations, this work was largely unbilled. Additionally, during the quarter, utilization in Russia was significantly lower compared to the same quarter of 2021. Utilization in Ukraine remains steady in a level similar to, but somewhat lower than 2021. Now let's turn to our business outlook. As a reminder, on February 28, we withdrew our full year business outlook due to the uncertainties related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. For the remainder of this year, we plan to provide guidance for the next quarter only and expect to resume our full year guidance at the beginning of the 2023 year. However, I will provide some additional insights and assumptions which will help frame our Q3 guidance and expectations for the second half of 2022. At this time, we continue to see a stable demand environment, which, combined with the progress in repositioning our workforce and portfolio, we expect will drive continued sequential revenue growth throughout the second half of 2022. However, with our reduced Russian customer revenue, we expect to see the impacts of tougher year-over-year revenue comparisons in both Q3 and Q4. We will continue to provide color regarding the impact the Russia exit has on EPAM's growth rates. We continue to see relatively high levels of productivity from our Ukrainian staff who were substantially located in the safer portions of the country. Our Q3 guidance assumes that we will maintain Ukrainian utilization levels only slightly lower than pre-war levels. Those Russian employees who wanted to relocate, we have relocated the majority of that population during the second quarter. Therefore, we expect a lower level of employee relocations in Q3. Parallel with the repositioning of our people, we are working through the process to align our cost and rate structures to reflect the prevailing economics in the geographies to which demand has been redirected. In many cases, the result will be increased billing rates to reflect higher costs, although we expect some lag in the establishment of these higher bill rates. The movement in customers, projects and people, we expect some short-term inefficiencies, including a higher level of bench, and therefore, a somewhat lower utilization as we scale new and existing delivery locations. The combination of these factors will continue to weigh on our profitability. However, we expect to see an improvement in profitability between Q2 and Q3 and are currently forecasting profitability in Q4 at levels similar to those we expect to achieve in Q3. And finally, today, EPAM has spent over $34 million as part of the company's $100 million humanitarian commitment to our Ukrainian employees and their families. We expect further humanitarian expenditures will be made throughout 2022 and into 2023. Now moving to our Q3 2022 outlook. We expect revenues to be at least $1.210 billion, producing a year-over-year growth rate of at least 22%. In constant currency terms, revenue growth is expected to be at least 26%. Included in these growth rates is approximately 400 basis points of revenue contribution from acquisitions closed over the last 12 months. I will also point out that we expect customers based in Russia to contribute less than $10 million in revenues in the quarter compared with the $44 million in Russia-based customer revenues generated in Q3 of 2021. For the third quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 15% to 16%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 19% and non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to be approximately 22%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be at least $1.65 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be at least $2.48 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59.4 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements in the third quarter. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $38 million. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $5.7 million. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be negligible. Tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $13.6 million. And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $5.9 million in the quarter. In addition to these customary GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments, and consistent with Q2, we expect to have ongoing non-GAAP adjustments in Q3 resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Please see our Q2 earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP guidance. We're pleased with our Q2 performance, which is the result of a lot of hard work by our employees around the globe, whom I want to thank for their dedication and the world-class service that they provide to our customers. Operator, let's open the call for questions.
Operator: Our question comes from Bryan Bergin of Cowen.
Bryan Bergin: I wanted to start with a growth composition question. So can you comment on how the attribution of growth between new clients versus existing clients turned out in 2Q? And how you see that progressing over the course of the second half? Just trying to understand if you're seeing a return to new client inflow versus servicing, that existing base amid all of this global transition. And really just trying to understand how you're thinking about the recovery of new logo flow if you haven't gotten back to it already.
Jason Peterson : Bryan, so this is Jason, and thanks for the question. From a demand standpoint and revenue growth, we continue to see solid growth in the existing customers and probably with a little bit of a slowdown in new customers in Q2, because I think you'll remember that our focus, certainly in March, probably April and May was really focused more on retaining existing customers. So we continue to grow significantly with the existing customers, as you can see by our revenue beat. And then probably by the time we got to the second half of Q2, we began to focus again on new logo activity. And so right now, you've got quite a bit of new logo-driven demand that we expect to come in the second half. But again, I think that probably just as a top line, I'd say that we continue to see growth in both our new and our existing customers.
Bryan Bergin : Okay. That makes sense. And then just on the workforce, if you excluded the workforce attrition from Russia, can you give us a sense of how the sequential billable headcount landed in the second quarter? And really just how you're thinking about your ability to return to the pre-war quarter-over-quarter headcount levels across the broader global footprint as you go through the second half.
Jason Peterson : I'm going to let Ark talk about headcount, but let me just mention attrition. So if we exclude Russia, where we've had higher both voluntary and involuntary attrition, our attrition rates have remained very consistent in Q4, Q1 and Q2. Ark, do you want to talk about headcount?
Arkadiy Dobkin : Yes. And on headcount, I think definitely, the total number is impacted by our exiting in Russia right now. But in general, just to understand, we're pretty comfortable that we will be able to return to our pre-war situation. I think it's difficult to compare this with 2021, which was a special year for everybody from the growth perspective where sometimes we were growing the headcount against 2022, like in 30% plus, sometimes 40% per quarter on an annual basis. So I don't think anybody will be coming back to this. But definitely, to what we were experiencing in quarter-by-quarter and also on the annual growth in '19, for example, or in '18, we will be coming back to the same speed. And we're comfortable with this based on what we were sharing during our Analyst Day. We position ourselves outside of this traditional Eastern European landscape which we have, in Latin America, in Western and Central Asia and India as well. So that's making us pretty comfortable that we will be able to address the demand.
Operator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research.
Darrin Peller : It's good to see the execution. And I really just want to hone in on the actual headcount changes that you've been making over the last couple of quarters and how it's playing out in the new markets with the newer delivery centers now. And really just to give us a quick update on what kind of performance you're seeing out of those newer locations, whether it's where you move people or you've been really growing your headcount.
Arkadiy Dobkin : So our increase was between 1,200 and 1,300 people in Q2. And all of this clearly was outside of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. So we share -- if you think and compare it with the past, exactly explain why we feel comfortable right now that we will be able to continuously grow in the future as well with similar rates which we experienced before.
Darrin Peller : Okay. And so when we think about the execution and the utilization of those, where do you see in terms of time frame then being at more of a full run rate so they can actually produce the same types of revenue? And as a quick follow-up, I mean, the newer regions you were talking about at your Investor Day, some in the Latin American areas and some in further and incremental areas, even in Eastern Europe, if you could just give us a quick update on how it's progressed.
Jason Peterson : Yes. So from a utilization standpoint, if I talk about Q2, what we saw, as you would expect, is quite low utilization in Russia. But one of the reasons why you had the revenue beat that we had is our utilization was quite a bit higher in the rest of the world than we had originally expected. So utilization levels have remained pretty solid and particularly quite solid in Ukraine, considering everything that's going on there. We are expecting as we go from Q2 to Q3 that we may see somewhat lower levels of utilization. Because as you transition work from one country to another, you might end up with a somewhat larger bench in, let's say, the donating country and then we're building up capacity in these newer countries. And again, you have a little bit more bench there. But as Ark said, I think we feel really good about our ability to add headcount to support demand. We've made really good progress in both transitioning resources to some of these new geographies and adding resources in these geographies. And as Ark said, we're around sort of 40% of our delivery capacity in the traditional sort of CIS region. So I think we feel good about not only our execution in Q2, but our ability to support ongoing demand in Q3 and Q4.
Operator: Our next question comes from Maggie Nolan of William Blair.
Margaret Nolan : I wanted to check in on how the conversations regarding those -- adjusting those rate cards to the new delivery locations you're going as well as, obviously, wage inflation is probably complicating this. And then on the kind of new delivery locations aspect of it, do you expect a resolution by 2023? Or will there be an impact of that kind of adjustment phase that persists into the next year?
Jason Peterson : Yes. Maybe I'll let Ark comment on customers, but just in terms of the algebra. What we see as we transition resources to new geographies is that you have a change in compensation almost immediately. And then there's a lag, as you know, Maggie, in terms of our ability to get rate increases. And so we have some customers where the rate increases are immediate, some customers where there might be a quarter lag and some customers where we might not see rate increases until as we enter 2023. Traditional to EPAM operating structure, we collect data on all of this, which is updated on a daily basis. We run dashboards. And so we can see that we're making good progress, both in terms of the conversations. In some cases, we actually already have the rate changes in place. In other cases, we have agreement to have the rate changes in place later in the year. So Maggie, I think we're making really good progress and I would expect, let's say, the vast majority of those conversations to be completed with higher rates as we enter Q1 of 2023. I don't know, Ark, do you want to talk about conversations with clients?
Arkadiy Dobkin : I think, exactly like Jason said, we're still in the process. And right now, the feel is pretty optimistic from the result of this process. We know a significant number of clients already agreed on rate adjustments. Some of it is delayed for the next month, two or three. So as that's what we mentioned already today, that we expect approaching the profitability rate similar to pre-war conditions in 2023. Again, approaching this there are too many moving parts. Some of them not even related to these events, because if we think about what's happening, foreign exchange, for example, and sometimes, it's the market situation as well within euro and U.S. dollars and then what currencies we pay compensation in the future. So it's a more difficult conversation. But rates are right on the way, and we are optimistic on this, in this sense.
Margaret Nolan : That's helpful. And then Jason, how does the cash you generated this quarter compare with your expectations going into the quarter just given all the atypical expenditures you've had of late? And then what's the expectation for how cash flow should trend from here?
Jason Peterson : Yes. I would say that cash flow was pretty good. I think we tried to hold DSO to 70, and it did end up at 71. And to them may have had a modestly negative impact. And we're trying to sort of keep DSO in and around or maybe slightly lower than 71 on a go-forward basis. We do expect cash flow conversion to be over 100% in Q3, which is kind of more consistent with sort of historical patterns. And right now, both our cash position and our ability to generate cash is pretty encouraging.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America.
Tyler DuPont: This is Tyler DuPont on for Jason. Last quarter, you had suggested that you could be back to pre-war normalized growth in margins by the first part '23. But based on the 2Q results and the 3Q guidance so far, do you feel this could happen even sooner? And can you just like quantify what your benchmarks are for those pre-war levels?
Jason Peterson : I think when we -- so we're guiding to, what, 15% to -- 15% to 16% in Q3. And what I said, just in case it wasn't clear in the fixed portion of the call here today, is that we expected that we could see profitability in a similar level in Q4. So that's already trending back towards that traditional sort of 16% to 17% range. . And when we kind of talk about our historical range, that's more what we mean rather than the elevated profitability that we would have seen during very, very high demand periods last year. But again, I feel that the progress to date, I think, is pretty good, as you can see by the guide. And as Ark said, we're continuing to work through the pricing and the other adjustments, but it's still a little too early to sort of communicate exactly where we expect 2023 to end up.
Tyler DuPont: Okay. Perfect. And just one more. As you continue on your path for headcount diversification, can you maybe discuss some of the regions that have been relatively easier to build out versus the ones that have been a bit more challenging? And on that line, do you feel that you are past the riskiest phase of your headcount diversification efforts?
Jason Peterson : Okay. Yes, from the standpoint of the ability to add headcount, we feel that we've actually -- we're ahead of our own goals in terms of building out Latin America. And we've seen strong growth in India, seen very strong growth in Central Europe. And so yes, I mean, the market continues to be a bit of a challenge. But I don't think we've had any real difficulty hiring to meet demand and to create the capacity that we want to have outside of what we call the impacted regions. . And so not to say that things couldn't change in the future, but right now, I think we feel pretty good about our ability to build out capacity outside of the region through both relocations and through the additional headcount, effectively hiring in the region.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley.
James Faucette: I wanted to dig in again on demand and client relationships. Obviously, the client retention has been quite good, et cetera. But as you're moving resources around, is there -- are you still having customers decide and indicate that they want to change delivery locations and what are the trends around that? And how quickly do you expect customers if they are doing that to get settled on their preferred delivery regions?
Arkadiy Dobkin : I think it's a very right question. And I think there is no simple answer in which it would be addressed in. Everybody kind of approach -- there are some groups of clients which are really trying to mitigate risk and move out of the region in danger. There are some clients which is continuously working almost in kind of pre-war scenarios. And there are some new clients come in there as well. So -- but again, as you probably understand, too, it's all a little bit moving target. We're working month by month, day by day, and sometimes, seeing something unexpected. But in general, I think we shared exactly the numbers which we kind of aggregate in what we understand going to have. We're clearly not in business as usual in general situation. So when we have to move thousands of people and rest of our business continue to approach apparently outside, a lot of delivery capacity, it's nothing as business as usual. But if you think that we're still growing and especially if you think how growth happening without Russia, because this is where we disconnected, our organic constant currency growth outside of Russia in Q2 was like 37%. So which means that there is normal demand if you take in account that we exiting there. So I know I've not given you a precise answer, but there is no precise answer. There are clients which is trying to completely change, approaching the right clients which are picking up on this capacity which released from them. And in some respect, a little bit similar to what we were experiencing in 2014, second time.
James Faucette : Got it, got it. That's really helpful though. And then on top of everything else, what have been the macro-related conversations with your clients, both in terms of existing and potential? And are you seeing any indications of softening, whether it be lengthening sales cycles or having clients approaching and say, hey, these are projects that we'd like to put off because we're a little uncertain? And are you having those conversations at all? And how is macro contemplated in your outlook, if at all?
Arkadiy Dobkin : Are you relating to situation in Eastern Europe or you...
James Faucette : Or just the economy, yes, the economy more generally, yes.
Arkadiy Dobkin : Okay. I think, first of all, for us sometimes it's difficult to distinguish one to another because it's not necessary clients said exactly why this conversation might happen. So these conversations are happening. But again, they were happening like 12 months ago, they were happening 24 months ago. If it's a little bit more often, maybe. But it's still difficult because it's even volatile by quarter by quarter. And the reasoning for this could be that the situation where majority of our resources are or economy. So it's very difficult to distinguish for us.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Surinder of Jefferies.
Surinder Thind : Following up on the earlier question about just clients' desire for the delivery model. Are those -- are the client conversations continuing to evolve in the sense that there were clients last quarter that requested a change in their -- where delivery is from, and this quarter, there's new sets of clients that are asking for delivery changes? Or how should we think about the potential for your year-end targets to kind of evolve? Like I realize you kind of said that it's fluid. But I just wanted to make sure I understand all the push-pull factors here.
Arkadiy Dobkin : So I think -- again, I think we're repeating ourselves, but everything is a little bit moving target. Some clients were asking last quarter if we're settled. Some clients might be asking today and will be asking tomorrow as well. So at the same time, if you aggregate, we see the picture where demand independently from locations is still pretty strong. So -- and that's what I mentioned, which is not exactly right comparison, but some sense similar to what we experienced eight years ago when some clients were completely leaving the region and some other clients were picking up. And we see these trends as well. What would be bigger, we will see probably in two and three quarters. And it's also dependent on what would be happening. What would be actually happening in the region and what would be results of the current war as well. But with -- on top of this, and that's what we're communicating, we're pretty comfortable with speed of growth outside of the region. When we're talking about Latin America and India, West and Central Asia, we're pretty comfortable that we would be able to grow from apply point of view in line with what we need.
Surinder Thind : Understood. And then in terms of just a clarification on Russia, it sounds like all of the individuals that you wanted to relocate or have requested relocation are done. So what is left in Russia at this point? And is it assumed that all of that work will be transitioned within the next quarter or 2? Any color there or any additional color there?
Arkadiy Dobkin : Yes. We’re finalizing the conditions how we exit in Russia completely. And I mentioned today that the Russians regulated their requirements, and we're going through this right now, which might take another month or so. And after this, the rest of headcount which we have in Russia today will be outside of EPAM, which is currently already less than 1,000 people.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays.
Ramsey El-Assal: I was wondering if you could update us on your thinking around M&A and the degree to which potentially you could leverage M&A to help fill in some of the gaps or address some of the challenges that have come out of the geopolitical situation you find yourselves in.
Arkadiy Dobkin : I think approach for M&A didn't change for us much. Very similar like in the past M&A for us, it's additional capabilities. Sometimes, beginning of the growth in some region. But from the point of the current delivery platform and the delivery locations, we already feel pretty comfortable, these all foundations which we have. I don't think M&A will be specifically important for this part. So we are sourcing in traditional agent capabilities in consultant market and industry expertise and maybe sometimes, in new locations, but again, it's not critical for us because we already established a pretty good footprint with growth.
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And then my follow-up is just on a question around sort of the macro resilience of the business. And again, I'm not referring to Eastern Europe and the military conflict there. I'm referring more to just the economic environment more broadly. Can you talk about how you think about EPAM in the context of dealing with cyclical pressures, recessionary pressures? I think typically, historically, IT services has been somewhat cyclical. I think some of the digital tailwinds today may provide sort of a secular tailwind that might help quite a bit through a recessionary period. But I'm just curious, Ark, your view about how the business fares during a hypothetical recession.
Arkadiy Dobkin : So I think we do have experience in the past. It's always difficult to predict how experience from the past is applicable for the future and how different the next recession going to be. But in the past, we usually were practically left for two, three quarters and then started to grow again. I think in general, that's what we are mentioning as well. In our industry, with all what's happening, I think we will be able to kind of tune headcount for a couple of quarters, and all kind of challenges in 2020, 2021. And specifically, 2022 make us actually much more resilient and much more adaptive to address potentially necessary adjustments. So I think, and again, we already talked about it today about that we feel ourselves much more comfortable, much more prepared for some elements of unknown. And we probably during these last couple of years, we talked about it in Investor Days, not only about this war, it's about situation in Belarus during the last couple of years, trained and prepared better than anybody else on the market right now, for recession as well, if it would be happening.
Operator: Our next question comes from Puneet Jain of JPMorgan.
Puneet Jain : Good quarter, guys. I have like a question on gross margins. Given that your delivery profile is changing, can gross margins go back to the prior pre-war 35%, 36% levels? Or maybe like the new locations, the pricing dynamics, labor dynamics there might result in like a different gross margin profile over the medium term compared to what it used to be before this invasion?
Jason Peterson : Yes. So this is Jason. And so from the standpoint of gross margin, I think gross margin in Q2 came in somewhat better than we had expected due to our ability to continue to deliver at certain locations and just kind of manage demand. We are expecting a bit of an improvement in gross margin between Q2 and Q3. And as we've talked about, we think there's a temporary impact as we shift people into new geographies, some of which are more expensive than the geographies in which they're leaving. And so there will be a temporary impact that we expect to largely address by the time we enter 2023. But there could be a little bit of compression on margin relative to the very high levels that we were running at when we were running at 18% IFO or something, right? And so when we talk about kind of our return to profitability, we are really sort of thinking more about the traditional 16% to 17% range. We continue to see good efficiency from an SG&A standpoint. And so again, I think I probably would sort of guide us towards the adjusted IFO and just assume that we'll have to manage it between the two components. But again, feel good about our ability to head back towards the higher levels of gross margin. But they could be slightly lower than they've been during the particularly hot quarters of 2021.
Puneet Jain : Understood. And then, obviously, you mentioned macro remains healthy and all the good comments there. Has there been any change in client priority in terms of the type of projects they execute? Like have you seen any changes in type of projects or any changes in sales cycles or the speed at which they award new projects at all?
Jason Peterson : We -- I noted some people are talking about maybe an eventual shift towards efficiency or cost efficiency. We have not seen that at this time. So we still see the traditional drivers, application modernization, cloud migration, data, and then all the platform engineering that EPAM is well known for. And so we still see those as underlying drivers. And part of the reason why I think we feel comfortable guiding towards sequential growth both in Q3 and as we talked about it and expected in Q4 as well. But does that answer that question or?
Operator: Our next question comes from Arvind Ramnani of Piper Sandler.
Arvind Ramnani: I just wanted to ask about your kind of -- your ahead -- kind of roughly maybe six months looking at these new geos and kind of taking a closer look at scaling operations and input in geos across the globe. As you kind of digest what you've looked at in terms of local talent in markets, which goes outside say, Belarus and Ukraine and Russia are looking kind of promising to kind of scale up as you look out over the next two -- couple of years?
Arkadiy Dobkin : I think it's difficult to add something substantial in a couple of minutes answer versus what we shared already during our Analyst Day in May. And I think when we went actually to some level of details. And I can only repeat that, for example, what's happening during the last six months, in some respects, was prepared during the previous like years. We were specifically talking about how we were growing in India. And during the last couple of years, it's become one of the fastest talent growing market for us, and we continue to do this.  We were starting to focus in on Latin America before war happened. And we are pretty impressed with the level of talent there. And a number of countries across Western, Central Asia, which we started to focus in 2020, 2021. And some of them like after the war, we seeing as a good potential as well. That's why again already was answering several times today. We're pretty comfortable that we will be able to scale with the talent outside of our traditional locations. And don't forget that we're still growing pretty significantly in Central and Eastern Europe, which we have very strong experience and complement all of these locations with people who decided to relocate. And this is abysmal number of people too. So basically, we have advantage of being an EPAM DNA and EPAM experience in new ups for us.
Arvind Ramnani : Terrific. And just one quick follow-up. Just in terms of your gross margin, clearly, it's been impacted by this transition. Are you able to provide some color on how much of the impact was due to utilization in Russia versus the transition to higher cost geos?
Jason Peterson : Let me think. There's -- whenever we sort of give you a description of the impact, there's a whole series of different things that are impacting profitability. And so, I don't know, the change into the new geographies is probably having at least the impact or more so than the Russian utilization. And what it is going to -- we're going to continue to move people into new geographies, we did that in Q2. We're going to do that in Q3. And so you're going to see some accumulation of people who are still sort of in a holding pattern, waiting to get rate increases even though their costs have gone up. So that's why I think that you'll see profitability in Q3 and Q4 being more similar rather than an increase in profitability between Q3 and Q4. But again, we're working through it, Arvind. And again, I think we feel relatively comfortable that we're making good progress with clients around appropriate rates for the geographies. And then we continue to have the same menu of options we've always had and that we also have relatively lower cost centers in Central and Western Asia, India, other. And so we offer a full range of opportunities for clients.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Grossman of Stifel.
David Grossman : I just wanted to follow up a couple of things you said earlier in the call. The first was, I think you said you expect about 30% of your delivery capacity to come from the impacted regions in the back half of the year, and that's down from 60%, I believe, at the end of last year. So when you look at that change, is that the way to think about the distribution of work? And secondly, it seems about half of that decline came from closing down Russia. I just want to make sure that I got those numbers right.
Arkadiy Dobkin : Yes. At the beginning of this year, we were a little bit under 60% between three countries. Right now we're at about 40%. By end of the year, we expect to be closer to 30%. And this is approximately clearly present distribution of work as well, yes.
David Grossman : Well, I was -- it looks like about half of that decline, of that 30% change, 15% of that was shutting down Russia. I just wanted to -- it seems like the math works that way.
Arkadiy Dobkin : That's right.
David Grossman : Okay. And then the second question I had was just about the new geographies that you open -- that you're opening. Is the percentage of employees that are being paid in U.S. dollars, is that changing at all with the opening and expansion of the new geographies?
Arkadiy Dobkin : So it's a mix, and we still have not moved geographies which will be denominated in USD, which make it clearly the whole story a little bit complicated when you try to calculate it. But it's still going to be a factor, because in some new locations, which we enter in, especially in west -- specifically in West and Central Asia, we will be paying in -- salaries in USD calculation.
Jason Peterson : Yes, David. So it's mixed. But the Russian population -- the Russian employees were paid in rubles. And some of them are going to end up in countries that are paid in local currency and some of them are going to end up in countries where we are using a U.S. dollar as the currency for compensation.
David Grossman : Any idea of just of your cost of goods, what percentage is in USD?
Jason Peterson : I can't do that off the top of my head, David, and it would also be hard for me to do it, but let me see what we can do to provide information to the market. But I think we've historically talked about -- actually, want to some -- I can't do that off the top of my head, so let me try to provide some information on that later.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Arkadiy Dobkin, President and CEO, for any closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin : Thank you, operator, and thank you, everybody who joined us today. As always, if you have any questions, David is available to help. And in general, I think we're doing better than we would expect like four, five months ago. And we're still in challenging time. But again, we see that we kind of stabilizing and now we're much more comfortable to say that we know how to redesign like our delivery platform, and it works. Thank you.
David Straube: Valerie, before we close out the call, I'd like to acknowledge, we experienced some audio quality issues with the management commentary portion of the call. We have posted a copy of our prepared remarks in the Q2 quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations site on epam.com. So please go there if you need further clarifications on our prepared remarks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-05 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the EPAM Systems First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker host, David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
David Straube: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company’s first quarter 2022 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today’s call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. I’d like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today’s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company’s earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings material located in the Investors section of our website. With that said, I’ll now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. During our previous earnings call, I finished my remarks with our assurance that the level of maturity that the EPAM has reached over the last few years, along with our ability to operate and manage our performance during the difficult times in 2014 and 2015 in Ukraine and 2020 and 2021 in Belarus, allows us to say that we were well prepared to address the potential challenges of 2022 by leveraging our broad global reach and deep regional insight and by applying our strong engineering DNA and, most importantly, our never-ending entrepreneurial spirit to continue making the future real for our clients, our employees and our global and local communities while keeping everybody as safe as possible. Like everyone we didn’t expect the war. By any measurement, the quarter has been unlike any other quarter in our history. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has changed the world and impacted tens of millions of people, including tens of thousands of our employees, their families, friends, neighbors in Ukraine and around the world. What we thought was unimaginable when we reported our Q4 earnings on February 17, all changed a week later. Now let me repeat a simple statement. EPAM, as a company, fully stands with Ukraine. During the last months since the beginning of the war that was started by the Russian government, our absolute top priority has been and continues to be the safety and well-being of our employees and their families in Ukraine. Today, our employees in the region and around the globe continue to support each other, donating time and resources to help their colleagues in Ukraine. Additionally, the company has provided significant financial and logistical support to help move our Ukrainian employees and their families to safe areas inside and outside of Ukraine. As we have previously announced, EPAM has committed US$100 million in assistance to help with the broad range of needs for our people and their close ones. Along this financial assistance, there has been an outpouring of support from a great number of clients and partners responding with gestures and different type of aids. Thinking more broadly about the people of Ukraine, we established the EPAM Ukraine Assistance Fund to support charitable aid organizations that provide direct relief to those in vulnerable situations across Ukraine. This fund is a separate from and in addition to the $100 million humanitarian commitment previously mentioned. And despite the very challenging and sometimes unimaginable conditions on the ground in Ukraine, our Ukrainian colleagues have been resilient and dedicated to their work and customer responsibilities, continuing to produce and to deliver results. EPAM’s management team, together with our clients, are extremely impressed and grateful for those incredible efforts and we see today increased interest from our customers to continue directing work to Ukraine. I personally want to thank each and every one on our Ukrainian team. However, where we guided wrong, we were also somehow right about our level of readiness to address unknown. Because today despite the broad and disruptive nature of the events unfolding daily, we find ourselves to be better prepared than we imagined just three months ago. Our investments in hardening our operational and logistical platforms, teams and processes have enabled us to respond quickly and establish a framework for continued phased recovery procedures. Let us try to illustrate it in a bit more structured way by presenting several stages of our current journey or at least the way we are currently thinking about things. First, in addition to preserving the safety of our Ukrainian famers and their families, while helping to move many thousands of people from east to west inside the country and abroad, our initial focus during the last few months has been on maintaining our customer relationship and continues to deliver important initiatives, despite the war and interrelated, geopolitical challenges. Those opportunities [ph] we define for our self as a Phase 1, a period of safety and stabilization of our operations, it is very little detention to initiation beyond that. Under the current conditions we believe this phase is largely completed and we will call it out as a notable success. Jason will illustrate in more details with specific numbers for our Q1 results and our guidance for Q2 shortly. So while we are managing through the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, we also are working with our customers to address their concerns and request to reposition projects and teams to different geographies, which is very much guided with the business continuity plans we had previously established with clients, including multiple allocation alternatives for our employees. In April, we also made the decision to exit our operations in Russia, which is a step with the market and the broader global response to the actions of the Russian government. We are fully committed to our talent in Russia who share our values and our opposition. And for most of our employees in the region, we are working in multiple location alternatives to allow them to remain with company in advance their carriers at a farm. This statement bring us to what we consider to be a Phase 2, which is our activities to accelerate the diversification or a balance if you will, of our global locations and continued growth of our delivery capabilities. We have already begun the second phase, which closure overlaps with the Phase 1. This acceleration includes rapidly scaling already exists in other locations in India, Latin America and Central Asia, as well as establishing several newly created delivery hubs and expanding many existence across Europe. This expansion support active reposition for our current employees and simultaneously creates opportunity to develop the local talent market in those hot locations. This will allow us to maintain the experience delivery talent we current have, while also establishing new delivery footprints and allowing for significant increases in local value and better facilitating future growth in those locations. At this point, we can report that this development is in play already, and we seeing early success, we will continue to update you in our progress on those efforts throughout the year. I would also point out that in large part, the diversification program was well underway even during the past several years. Before COVID our allocation to [indiscernible] from Ukraine, Belarus and Russia was close to 70% of our total production capacity. By the end of 2021, it was less than 16%. And we believe by the end of 2022, we will manage to reduce the allocation of our production stuff in the region to about 30%. Additionally, we have a strong contention to maintain and potentially grow our talent pool on Ukraine, which we believe will continue to be significant talent market post one. While the size and scale of this disruption has been very significant and while we still should expect some very much unexpected things to happen, I think, it’s important to bring context that the rest of our business and customer portfolio continue to operate in the business as usual manner. The longer term demand trends that have driven growth in our business before remains very much intact. We believe these trends combined with our unique experience enabled bio differentiated in the DNA and market position will place us from the place to our family organic revenue growth profile sooner rather than late. And this brings us to what we call Phase 3 the period superior to focus on rising demand. This phase is also underway and we’ll occur in parallel with two phases we described above. What this means is that we are focusing on revenue growth for new and existing customers and starting to operate in type of new normal environment for us. We believe that this new normal should elevate us well to sequential revenue growth during the second half of 2022. After that we believe we will be able to enter Phase 4 of our recovery plan. We shall be time to focus on profitability with objective to return to profit levels consistent with farm historical target ranges. This goes through and area of attention on our agenda already today. But we plan to have a stronger focus on profitability, as well as on improving rate structures and optimizing performance of our new delivery locations throughout the second half of 2022 to show visible performance improvements, while this phase will likely carry on into 2023. I think it’s very much understandable that all the phases I just outlined are not sequential. And while many elements of these efforts will overlap in time, they also are very much interrelated and bring high level of operational complexity into our day-to-day activities. At the same time, it’s also important to underscore the first two phases are already very much underway and the next two phases are just getting started, that all phases will continue to be present in our life for some time. To summarize, well, the cost of this disruption is beyond our control. Today, we are responding at a scale in a place to put our best effort together to contain as much as possible, the impact of this war within 2022. Our new strategy is not really new, but an acceleration of our previously stated strategy, adapt, grow and deliver value across a broader, more engaged ecosystem of people, customers, and partners. Based on our revolving credit, tax integrated with innovation and information consulting capabilities we were developing over the last year. We will return to industry-leading growth and a more in line profitability model. While still challenging on the field, developing the company 2021 revenue in three years time, as we have done previously three times since our IPO in 2012. I’m confident we will execute through this unimaginable challenge and emerge as a more diverse, more resilient and more relevant apart. I hope you’ll be able to join our Investor and Analyst Day event on May 19 in Boston, where you’ll share more insights in our plans and goals. Now, let me turn the call over to Jason, who will talk about our Q1 results in additional perspective as we look at Q2 and beyond.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, EPAM delivered strong results despite the impact of the company’s decision in March to discontinue services to customers based in Russia. In Q1, we also incurred some of the new initial costs resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in the acceleration of our geographic diversification strategy. Certain of these costs, including expenditures related to EPAM’s humanitarian commitment to Ukraine, charges for impairment of Russian long-lived assets and costs associated with accelerated employee relocation have been excluded non-GAAP financial results. We have included additional disclosures specific to these and other related items in our Q1 earnings release. During the quarter, EPAM generated revenues of $1.17 billion, a year-over-year increase of 50.1% on a reported basis and 53% in constant current currency terms, reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of 290 basis points. Looking at the performance of our industry verticals in the quarter, Travel and Consumer grew 90.9% driven by strong organic growth from both our retail and travel customers, as well as revenue contributions from recent acquisitions. Financial Services grew 54% with very strong broad based growth coming from asset management, insurance and banking. Life Sciences and Healthcare grew 35.9%, business information and media delivered 31.5% growth in the quarter. Software and Hi-Tech grew 28.8% in the quarter and finally our emerging verticals delivered 59.4% growth driven by clients in telecommunications, energy, manufacturing and automotive. From a geographic perspective, America is our largest region representing 59% of our Q1 revenues grew 46% year-over-year or 46.5% in constant currency. EMEA representing 36% of our Q1 revenues grew 62.7% year-over-year or 68.1% in constant currency. EMEA performance was driven by stronger organic growth combined with an incremental contribution from recent acquisitions. CEE was representing 3% over Q1 revenues grew 10.5% year-over-year and 30.6% in constant currency. Growth in the quarter was reduced by the initial impact of the discontinuance of services to our customers located in Russia. And finally, APAC grew 41.2% year-over-year or 41.7% in constant currency terms. And now represents 3% of our revenues. In Q1, revenues from our top 20 clients grew 32% year-over-year while revenues from clients outside our top 20 grew 63%. Moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 33.4% compared to 33.5% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 33.3% compared to 34.9% for the same quarter of last year. Gross margin of Q1 2022 was negatively impacted by the inability to recognize revenue resulting from work done for certain of our Russian customers, as well as lower utilization in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. GAAP SG&A was 20.3% of revenue compared to 17.5% in Q1 of last year and non-GAAP SG&A came in at 15.6% of revenue compared to 15.5% in the same period last year. SG&A in the quarter reflected a higher level of bad debt, largely driven by a higher level of reserves associated with the customers located in Russia. GAAP income from operations was $129 million or 11% of revenue in the quarter compared to $107 million or 13.7% of revenue in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $189 million or 16.1% of revenue in the quarter compared to $137 million or 17.5% of revenue in Q1 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.6%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits was 23.9% and includes a one-time charge related to certain tax credits. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.52, reflecting a $0.34 decline or 18.3% decrease year-over-year. GAAP EPS includes the impact of Ukrainian humanitarian expenditures, charges related to the impairment of Russian long lived assets, expenses related to accelerated staff relocation and losses on Russian ruble forward contracts or that were unwound in the quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.49, reflecting a $0.68 increase or 37.6% growth over the same quarter in 2021. In Q1, there were approximately 58.9 million diluted shares outstanding. Now turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q1 was a net cash outflow of $51.8 million, compared to a net cash inflow of $13 million in the same quarter of 2021. Q1 cash flow was negatively impacted by expenditures related to our Ukrainian humanitarian support initiative and the payment of a higher level of company-wide variable compensation based on our 2021 performance. We also accelerated the timing of variable compensation payments with a higher proportion paid in Q1 than in prior years. Free cash flow was negative $75.1 million, compared to positive free cash flow of $2 million in the same quarter last year. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. At the end of Q1, DSO was 69 days in compares to 62 days for Q4 2021 and 67 days for the same quarter last year. We expect to maintain DSO slightly above current levels throughout 2022. Now moving on to a few operational metrics. We entered the quarter with more than 55,050 consultants, designers and engineers, a year-over-year increase of 41.8%. Our total headcount for Q1 was around 61,600 employees. In the quarter, we had approximately 2,800 net additions, production headcount growth was negatively impacted by lower than planned growth in Ukraine and an actual reduction in Russia based production headcount. We continued to experience accelerated growth in production headcount in countries other than Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus. Utilization was 78.4% compared to 81.4% in Q1 of last year and 76.8% in Q4 2021. Our Q1 utilization includes those employees who have been assigned in a backup capacity to support projects substantially delivered from Ukraine. Although, these employees were counted as utilized for the purpose of our utilization calculations, this work was largely unbilled. Utilization in Ukraine did decline somewhat on a year-over-year basis, but as being maintained at extremely high levels considering the current operating environment. Now let’s turn to our business outlook. On February 28, we withdrew our business outlook due to the uncertainties related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. For the remainder of this year, we plan to provide guidance for the next quarter only with the expectation of resuming our full year guidance to the beginning of the 2023 year. Additionally, to help align with our thinking around significant events, let me provide a few broad assumptions, which will help frame our guidance for Q2 and the remainder of 2022. Russian aggression continues to take a terrible pull on Ukraine, but most of the fighting is currently concentrated in the Eastern portion of the country. We continue to see relatively high levels of productivity from our Ukrainian staff who are substantially located in safer portions of the country. Our Q2 guidance assumes that we will maintain Ukrainian utilization at slightly lower levels than those experienced in Q1. During the initial weeks of invasion, we were able to relocate approximately 2,000 employees out of the country where they’re safe and productive. EPAM has spent over $25 million so far as part of the company’s $100 million humanitarian commitment to Ukraine and to Ukrainian employees and their families. Further humanitarian expenditures will be made in Q2 and throughout the remainder of the year. To-date, we have relocated significant numbers of our Russian employees to delivery locations outside of Russia. And we expect to relocate more of our Russian employees throughout Q2. Employees relocated outside of Russia are being moved to fill billable positions and are expected to be billable in their destination countries. However, during Q2, we expect that lower levels of demand for Russia based resources will result in considerably lower utilization levels for those staff remaining in the country. At this time, we’re planning to maintain operations in Belarus. However, we expect a lower level of utilization as we execute business continuity plans for a defined number of clients who would like us to deliver from countries other than Belarus. In parallel with the repositioning of our people, we have begun the effort to align our cost and rate structures to reflect the prevailing economics in the geographies to which demand has been redirected. In many cases, the result will be increasing billing rates to reflect higher costs. Although, we expect some lag in the establishment of these higher bill rates. Additionally, we expect some short-term inefficiencies as we scale newer delivery locations. The combination of these factors will put downward pressure on our profitability in Q2. However, we expect to see ongoing improvement and profitability in the second half of 2022 with a return to something closer to our historical levels of profitability in the first half of 2023. Lastly, based on the continued strong demand, stability in our customer portfolio and progress in accelerating our global diversification, we expect to return to positive sequential revenue growth in the second half of 2022. Now moving on to our Q2 2022 outlook. We expect revenues to be at least $1.14 billion, producing a year-over-year growth rate of at least 29%. In constant currency terms, revenue growth is expected to be at least 34%. Included in these growth rates is approximately 600 basis points of revenue contribution to come from acquisitions closed over the last 12 months. For the second quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 3% to 5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 10% to 12%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 19% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation to be approximately 23%. Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be at least $0.73 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be at least $1.70 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59.5 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements in the second quarter. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $27.5 million. Amortization of the tangibles is expected to be approximately $6 million. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $1.5 million loss. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $16.5 million. And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $4 million in the quarter. In addition to these traditional GAAP to non-GAAP measurements consistent with Q1, we will have additional non-GAAP adjustments in Q2 that are result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Please see our Q1 earnings release for detailed reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP guidance. In summary, despite a challenging March, we are pleased with Q1 results. In Q2 and for the remainder of the year, EPAM will continue to focus on the geographic repositioning of our company. Then in the second half of the year, we expect to see both improving profitability and a return sequential growth. Now, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all EPAMers, but particularly those EPAMers working from Ukraine. It is hard to imagine living for all that you’re living through and still doing all that is necessary to meet delivery obligations and sustain EPAM operations in the country. My thoughts and prayers are with you and your families. I also have a huge amount of respect for all of you. Operator, let’s open the call up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question coming from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open.
Bryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. And I hope all of your colleagues remain safe here. First question I have for you is around client retention. So obviously, you had very solid revenue results here. But can you just give us more color around client conversations? Have you experienced any client losses to just their choice for reductions and risk exposure. And how is the conversion of new work with the existing clients progressing relative to maybe historical pace?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think it’s pretty understandable that kind of similar to us, clients also went through multiple sorts during the last – first couple weeks of invasion and then through couple months and a lot of opinions and assumptions where it changed. So we do have several cases, where clients decided to stop growing with us. But it’s very, very much exceptions and we have multiple cases where clients were – work with us and then returning back in several weeks and starting to grow with us as well. I think it’s – I would describe it as much better than we would expect several months ago. And I think the level of comfort and confidence is practically growing each week. We have multiple clients who talking to our people in Ukraine and expression there – appreciation and really amazement what happening and how my producing the level of productivity, the same like myself and Jason expressing during this already today. So – and during the last week, we see new business starting to come, some clients specifically asking to accurate and work in location. And we starting again hiring in Ukraine as well. So I think that would summarize this.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. Okay. That’s good to hear. And then just on the profitability outlook, so I wanted to dig into some of the contexts you provided around this phase four. So it sounds like you believe there’s the potential to achieve your prior levels of profitability here in the future. But are there any structural considerations in those future plans versus the prior operating model that you consider? So really just what are the risks you’re thinking about in getting back to that view and I think you said first half 2023? Thank you.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So if we talk about, I guess, Q2 and then talk about maybe the journey as you head back towards 2023, is that initially we’re going to have lower utilization, as I mentioned during the prepared remarks. Clearly in Russia, as we’ve exited – as we exit operations and particularly we have determined to stop doing work for Russian clients. We’ve got – we’ve modeled somewhat lower levels of utilization for Ukraine, just because the situation remains dynamic. And then, we are also seeking some clients who are asking us to do delivery. As Ark said, stay with EPAM, but ask us to do delivery outside of Belarus. And so you’ve got in that entire region, you’ve got probably somewhat lower utilization. And I think you’ll work through a lot of that here in Q2 with improving utilization in Q3. You do have obviously some standup costs associated with creating a whole series of new delivery centers and growing existing delivery centers, while we’re ramping down and still maintaining some of the costs associated with our current delivery locations, particularly in Russia. And then, what you have and we’ve talked about this in the past is, as you move people into the next geography, into their next delivery country is in some cases those are more expensive countries. And we pretty immediately take people’s compensation up. So there’s an increase in compensation costs. And then there needs to have be a discussion with clients about the associated rate increase. Those conversations are already underway, and we’ll be working on that throughout the year. But that’s probably the balancing act, because I think you work through the utilization and then the SG&A efficiency, SG&A will go up as a percentage of revenue in Q2, but then I believe begin to come back down in the second half. And then we’ve just got to work through all those sort of rate discussions.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question coming from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Darrin Peller: Thanks guys. First of all, really just hope everybody’s doing well and stay as safe as possible. Secondly, it’s very impressive to see you guys manage through this. And on that note, I really just want to understand when you think about looking forward for the next few quarters, the new balanced portfolio from a supply side for your business, if you could just help us understand if there’s going to be, if you’ve identified like any specifically new centers of real differentiated talent development. The way that you would leverage Ukraine and Belarus in the past, are there other markets that you see becoming your go-to differentiated markets are maybe newer, whether it’s Turkey, I know there’s been areas you’re moving some of the Russian base too. And so I’m wondering if some of those could be that source. And then just on top of that, is there any way you can help us understand the breakdown, the percentage breakdown of your employee base that you’d expect it to be within a couple of quarters after these moves occur?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. Thank you for the question. And I think we directionally indicated already how much we think by the end of the year, we expect people between Ukraine and Belarus, because in Russia we’re closing in the next few months. We are also hoping, I think we indicated this as well and Jason mentioned this specifically, we considering right now – right now that good number of our employees from Russia and some from Belarus will be relocated based on our BCP requirements from the clients. The location is happening right now to multiple countries, because mostly in Europe and Western Asia as well and Central Asia as well. So I don’t think we can ferry now details and percentages, which we going to have. But the idea definitely that we identify a number of specific countries where we think we can scale. But we also bring there the talent, which exists at EPAM. And we believe that in this configuration, we will be able to accelerate recruitment and bring connectivity to EPAM culture. And what it [indiscernible], which we were building this company for a long time. So at the same time, during the last 12 months, the fastest growing market for us was actually India and Latin America. And so we were talking about it before, we started that we focus in on diversification and this is actually working for us, and we will be accelerating even more in this talent market. So India and Latin America will be in the focus and new dev centers and existing dev centers in Europe, which will be complemented with our talent reallocated from our traditional locations, this creates stability and client comfort, which will believe will be driving the growth. Okay. I think that’s what we can share. I don’t think we can share very specific numbers right now.
Darrin Peller: All right, Ark. And then just a very quick follow-up is – you mentioned pricing discussions will obviously come after this. But can you just comment on the receptivity? We heard from one of your competitors yesterday and others in the industry that they’re seeing pretty understanding receptivity on the industry around it, inflation being passed through in price. So especially in the context of what you have to do to move folks, what kind of reaction are customers having now to that price offset?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So, we – I think we’ve talked about over the last couple of quarters that the market, just because of the imbalance between supply of technical resources and the immense demand, is that those conversations have been easier for a while. And then on top of it, our clients are also seeing the cost of their employees go up. So there’s some cognition that there is inflation in the market. And so these discussions were easier. The one thing I think I’ve been pleased by is just in conversations with clients, I think there’s an understanding that they do get a different level of productivity from EPAM. And so there’s an understanding that as we’ve had to make all these difficult transitions to different countries, that what they get from EPAM from a delivery standpoint truly is differentiated. And so that’s helped with the stability of maintaining customers, but it also is supportive of the conversations that we’ll be having about pricing. So, I think that’s how I’d answer that.
Darrin Peller: All right guys. Thanks and be safe. Thanks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is coming from the line of Arvind Ramnani with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Arvind Ramnani: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. And congrats on operating in a really tough environment. I just had a couple of questions. We have done some checks with folks on the ground and we’re quite amazed with the resilience that we heard from Ukraine. Can you provide some, let’s say, granular feedback on how you’re delivering this high levels of productivity from Ukraine? I know you provided the high-level sort of feedback, but can you provide some kind of more specific feedback on how you’re able to deliver these levels of productivity from Ukraine?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So as you know, like Ukraine, our largest location. And we had pretty distributed delivery centers, infrastructure in the country with several major data centers there. So during the first weeks, like the main focus was to bring as many as possible people to the western part of Ukraine where we have Kyiv [ph] of our central and establish a number of new data centers in the smaller cities around the region as well. So from infrastructure point of view and activity point of view, so we didn’t have practically any interruptions in Kyiv as well, which is our major city, major development center. So between these two, we practically were covering majority of the necessary work happening. So, I don’t know what else we here besides like praising our employees who were focusing and actually keeping their mind straight with this difficult situation for the work. So that was – plus a couple of thousand people, specifically women, who were able to relocate to Poland and to Hungary and work from these locations as well.
Arvind Ramnani: Perfect. And then just as you transition your talent from Russia or Belarus or Ukraine, where most of them being moved to, right? Is this them being moved to like Poland and Hungary? Or are they moved to the U.S.? Where are most of these folks being moved to who are exiting there?
Arkadiy Dobkin: No, this is pretty – this is a pretty sophisticated operation right now. And if I start to list all countries where people might be being right now, it would probably will be by the end of this call. But there are several specific areas. Poland, obviously, was one of the key destinations, but it’s not only Poland. It’s countries in Central Asia, it’s countries in – countries like Turkey and Serbia. So it’s all known names. But at the same time, it’s not even one-phase exercise because in some situation we have to move people very quickly. And then after this, find the final destination, which could be U.S. or Canada as well, depending on people, depending on skills profile. So it’s very much longer-term operation for us.
Arvind Ramnani: Terrific. And last question for me, I just want to follow up on Bryan’s question earlier on sort of existing and prospective clients. Clearly, I think existing clients are being supportive. But what is the feedback from like new clients? Are you still sort of selling to new logos and getting traction with newer clients?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. As we’ve mentioned, like, clearly, the real, real focus was to stabilize operation with existing clients and address opportunities of growth in existing clients which still happen, okay. Definitely, there are new logos coming to us and there are very trusted network of people in the industry who like bringing us to their new destination because people moving and they’re comfortable working with us and this is very, kind of very normal. Some of these people really believe in the differentiation level of service which you can bring. So this is still happening. But as you can see, we’re practically flat right now between Q1 and Q2, which means that it’s a balance right now. We’re getting stabilization and we really believe that Q3 and Q4 should be more reflecting on what’s happening. But we cannot tell exactly. Our expectation, otherwise, we will be guiding for the year.
Arvind Ramnani: Terrific. That’s impressed with you and folks in the EPAM. Thank you very much.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Great, thank you.
Jason Peterson: Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hi, Ark. Hi, Jason. First of all, much respect for what you and your employees achieved this quarter. It’s truly amazing. I guess my question is, can you accelerate some of the delivery diversification using M&A? Or is there just too much going on operationally that you would not add that to the list of things to do?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we’re looking at the opportunities. And even in this very difficult period, I don’t think our M&A strategy changed. We’re looking for actually additional skills and additional locations, but we’re not looking for very large ones because that’s a different level of integration. As you mentioned, it’s probably not exactly on our mind right now. But we’re looking for some small accelerators in different geographies so we can grow faster that would be necessary.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So they might actually be entry points or beachheads in the countries in which we’re not currently operating. They give us management experience in those countries and then we grow around them. So in many ways, they might start small but allow us to accelerate in different regions, including beyond the Balkans and Latin America.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Understood. Understood. And I think I did hear a comment with regards to new business development having restarted. Could you maybe provide more color around that? And is that perhaps an indicator that even your client conversations, as you mentioned previously, are transitioning from figuring out delivery with you to perhaps figuring out growth with you?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I really didn’t get the question exactly.
Jason Peterson: The new business development…
Arkadiy Dobkin: New business development, it’s – well, first of all, again, we have significant presence outside of the region. And we have – we have built pretty good reputation during the last year from quality of delivery. So we still have people coming to us. And some of them actually looking for the type of talent which we were having in this difficult right now region. And we have opportunity to relocate and mix capabilities right now and many clients are actually looking for this as well. So it’s really difficult in this situation to say that it’s a huge not both new logos coming, it’s not because people careful, cautious right now. But we see definitely a very positive direction happening since the beginning of March.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Understood. Got it. Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: The next question coming from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.
Ramsey El-Assal: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today and also amazing job that you guys are doing as we can all see. Can you describe how your balance – actually, what I meant to ask was, when you’re relocating people right away, is there a lag that’s due to travel, et cetera? Or with those relocation efforts, are you able to make those people productive pretty quickly? And I guess the following question there is, is there a backlog of people who are still waiting to be relocated? Or is the relocation sort of process largely complete, at least as it stands today, understanding that the situation on the ground is fast moving in terms of the conflict.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don’t think we would be sharing all logistical components of what’s happening because it’s difficult to describe as there are multiple challenges there and we’re really telling very directly that this is not an easy process and there are multiple aspects of this. So what we – I think what’s important instead of like talking about all the specifics, that we do believe that by the end of the year, our locations in Ukraine and Belarus would be not more than 30% of our capacity. I think that’s important focus, the rest of this, I would rather skip right now.
Ramsey El-Assal: Fair enough. Fair enough. And has there been any issues with attrition outside the kind of conflict zone. In other words, are you having – are the staff who you’re having to lean on in order to keep the going, having any burnout or morale issues in terms of just the degree to which you need to sort of lever them to keep the operation going, or are things okay on that side as well?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I’ll comment on attrition and put a few numbers out there. And so the attrition that has – has also been a very positive, I don’t want to call it a surprise but certainly if we didn’t have any incremental let’s say voluntary attrition. Well, we have that is some incremental involuntary attrition primarily related to Russia. And so we – we are up around, let’s say around the 20% range from an attrition standpoint. But from an – from a voluntary stand point the attrition levels we are seeing are very similar to what we saw in Q4 and Q3. So at least at this time, very little change in attrition and EPAM employees are highly supportive of all the work that needs to be done and obviously that’s why we’ve executed as successful as we have.
Ramsey El-Assal: That’s great to know. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.
David Grossman: Thank you. Good morning. I was wondering if I could, excuse me, just go back to the supply side and I kind of, maybe you could speak to some of the key similarities and maybe even the differences in building supply outside of your historical strengths in Belarus and the Ukraine, and perhaps share some lessons maybe learned from the efforts years ago to start up in India is that operation kind of had some fits and starts. I’m just curious what lessons you took from there that maybe helping you scale outside the region?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Think it did for the question, because like – and with you specifically, and some other analyst on the call who saw EPAM [indiscernible] 10 years ago and visited our locations back then. So 10 years ago, we were operated practically in four countries only. So in those countries at this time nobody was thinking that it’s possible to put together 10 of thousands of people. And we put a lot of investments in infrastructure, in our digital platforms, in our locational eco system. And when you asking what actually similar or not, we trying to bring all of this experience, how to build in kind of not relatively scalable centers, relatively scalable operation. And you mentioned India; we started in India much, much later than anybody else really. 2014 was a trigger for us to open the productions and then in Latin America and Mexico as well. And through applying the kind of lessons we learn during our completely didn’t feel start up in Eastern Europe. So India last year was the fastest growing location for us. But it wasn’t fastest growing location for us for the first three years it was practically flat or even going down. So we changed operations and while we still have the same management, which we acquired long time ago. So we have support of this team to transition this to very different company today. And that’s why India probably by end the year would be probably Number 2, Number 3 locations for us. Very similar has happening in Latin America. We were selecting very carefully the management teams there to see that if they would like to put very different standards on themselves. And we did a small acquisition last year, which we’re very happy. And Columbia growing for us very quickly. We open it like across Latin America as well, and Mexico is one of the fastest-growing locations for us. So I think we’re bringing what we know to new locations. And that’s why we’re pretty confident that – again, it’s difficult to be confident when there are so many unknown. But with some assumptions how it could happen, we do believe that even by the end of this year we will be growing back to our close to normal rates.
David Grossman: Right. So is there – just at least from where you sit today, are there any differences in these other geographies that you would highlight? Or is it looking very similar to what you’ve seen thus far in your key locations that you operate today?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So there are definitely differences. It would be kind of not responsible to say that it’s not. Countries in different development stage, there is a different level of software engineering kind of maturity there. But we do believe that we have multiple locations where we’re moving today which would be able to reach the level of quality which is standard for EPAM. So I can say this. We don’t see right now obstacles which would stop our growth as it was before.
Jason Peterson: And David, one of the differences might be the circumstances, right? So we’ve got a much larger number of people moving into these newer delivery locations, so bringing EPAM delivery methodologies, culture, all the different types of tools that Ark referred to. And so we start with, I would say, a greater injection of kind of EPAM culture into each of these locations than maybe you would have seen in prior movement into new geographies.
David Grossman: Got it. Great. Thank you for that and I just wanted to clarify one thing. I think you made – maybe it was you, Jason, a comment about the bench included in utilization and maybe I just misunderstood the comment. But perhaps you could just clarify that. Are you maintaining a larger bench in the Ukraine now just to back people up? Or did I just misunderstand that comment?
Jason Peterson: Yes. No, that’s fair. So let me clarify that probably for everybody here, is that we’ve got some individuals that were – that were added. And as Ark said, the focus of Q1 was to make certain that we were able to maintain delivery and obviously maintain customers. And so we had a fairly significant number of employees that were added that are not billing at this time. They are potentially billable but are currently not being billed. They’d show up in utilization because they’re technically in sort of billable roles, but we’re not charging for them to customers. We did exclude the expense for the purpose of the non-GAAP numbers that we provided. And the idea is that at some point in time and already we’re beginning to have discussions as to make certain that those positions become billable. But right now, they’re there to make certain that if there was any concern about continuity in Ukraine, that we’d have effectively kind of backup resources available. Generally, those are in countries clearly outside of the affected region.
David Grossman: Right. Could you just give us a sense of the scale of that backup kind of work for us at this point?
Jason Peterson: Yes. I think that you can see it in the press release; I think we’ve got to call out in terms of the guide. And it will – and so you can actually see sort of the percentage, the costs associated with it. And so it’s there in the press release.
David Grossman: Got it. All right. Good luck to all of you. You should be very proud of what you’ve been able to accomplish.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, David.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Dobkin for any closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you. First of all, I would like to personally thank the entire EPAM team for their dedication and leadership and commitment. We have been through a lot of – during the last couple of years and we’re definitely dealing right now with something which we never expected during the last months. So I really appreciate everybody staying with us and doing this with us, and our clients and our partners. And as always, for people on the call, so if you have questions, you know where to direct them. And hopefully, we will see you also in Boston in a couple of weeks. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: 0:02 Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the EPAM Systems Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. 0:25 I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
David Straube: 0:41 Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company’s fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. 0:54 With me on todays’ call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today’s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described in the company’s earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings material located in the Investors section of our website. 1:27 With that said, I’ll now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: 1:30 Thank you, David. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before turning to Jason to provide a detailed update on our fourth quarter overall 2021 results and our 2022 outlook, I would like to spend some time reflecting on last year performance and share some thoughts on our positioning for 2022. But even before doing that, I would like to share a couple of other thoughts. 1:59 Just last week, we celebrated the 10-year anniversary of our initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. So that is why this call is a bit special. Exactly 10 years ago, we provided our first guidance on our first earnings call. 2:17 EPAM in Q1 2012 was a company with 7,000 people and about $335 million in revenue. We recall back then, which reflected a strong priority indeed. EPAM was very much an unknown start-up with a minimal presence in the United States and Western Europe and with development centers across just a few countries in Eastern Europe. And we were extremely nervous because of all of that. 2:54 During our first call, we shared that our quarterly revenue grew 34% and our annual headcount increased by about 30%. And we guided that our 2012 revenue should go up around 23%, 25% from the prior year of 2011. Ten years later, we are a very different company. Since our IPO, EPAM has grown more than tenfold, expanded our global footprint across five continents and growing our team of professionals to more than 58,000 people and across 40 countries to become a recognized world leader in digital engineering and consulting services. 3:39 So at this moment, I would like to personally thank all of our employees, customers and shareholders who participated in achieving this notable milestone in EPAM journey, which we just deliberated last week on New York Stock Exchange podium, unfortunately, in a very small team due to understandable quality restriction. 4:02 What is also important is that 10 years later, we still feel very much as a fast-growing, constantly changing and learning start-up. As of today, we still can share that in our fourth quarter, we grew 53% and 44% organically, increased our annual head count by 43% and plan to grow revenues by at least 37% in 2022. So in short, we are running today faster than we did back then during our first post IPO days. 4:37 To be on a bit more formal side, for 2021, we generated almost $3.8 billion in revenues, reflecting a greater than 40% year-over-year growth, which included a strong result across all dimensions of our portfolio. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $9.05, a 43% increase over fiscal 2020. And in 2021, we also generated $461 million of free cash flow. 5:10 During our previous call three months ago, we shared the history of our transformational efforts while we were setting our 3-year mission plans. I will not go into the details again, but I would like to mention that 2021 was actually a special year for us. For the third time in a row since our IPO, we doubled the company in three years. 5:34 2021 was a year when we were aggressively building and expanding EPAM capabilities through our strong organic, especially across cloud data and consulting credits. And also, it was a record year from an M&A point of view, which help us to fuel some white spaces and also to mature our offerings in consulting, cybersecurity, digital marketing, digital platform and cloud delivery as well as in data and analytics. It also allows to better diversify our global delivery organization. 6:09 For sure, our 2021 results would not have been possible if not for our ability to attract and retain talent. To meet the extraordinary demand in 2021, we refined our employee value proposition, to elevate EPAM as a company with new-generation technologies where engineers, designers, architects and consultants can embrace modern practices, cutting-edge tech and deep collaboration approach during our client engagement. 6:42 We added more than 17,600 EPAMers, which is approximately 2.5x more employees in our previous record year of 2019. 2021 was the second year in a row of very much distributed with very high percentage of remote work, and with still very limited opportunities to meet in person with our team members and clients on a regular basis. 7:10 So it was a year when we doubled our efforts to focus on talent engagement practices through understanding of people capabilities, investing in their training and development and providing a wide area of opportunities to communicate and gather together [Indiscernible] as a team as well as through finding the best suitable engagement both from professional and from vocational point of view. 7:36 Additionally, we drove deeper connections across our global talent pool to each other and to global community of people and partners through our digital platforms, all which help us to keep high level of productivity and our attrition levels manageable in the current very challenging environment. 7:55 In 2021, the majority of our clients have been at the center of significant amount of transformation. This has driven very strong demand for our services across all verticals. In travel and consumer, we absorbed an extra rebound as post-pandemic priorities once again moved to the forefront of the discretionary spend agenda. 8:20 In financial services, we saw demand growth in both our existing customers and in several new and previously smaller clients. We'll continue the same of modernization and innovation of key business domains. Insurance, which was relatively new focus area within our financial services last year is today one of our fastest-growing subsegments. 8:43 Telecommunications, automotive, all part of our emerging verticals [Indiscernible] outpace previous year performance as clients in these sectors turn to EPAM's expertise and innovation, design experience and product and platform in [Indiscernible]. Life sciences & healthcare and software & hi-tech both continue to grow fast and demonstrating the potential to accelerate fast. While business information & media slowed down during the year, returned to a 30-plus percent growth rate in Q4. 9:17 2021 was also a noticeable year from a market recognition point of view. Some of them we shared previously, but I would list those together to demonstrate the progress we achieved or being not only the engineers anymore, but moving beyond into the integrated consulting and advanced engineering zone. EPAM was ranked as a top IT services company on Fortune’s 100 Fastest-Growing Companies list for the third consecutive year and also was included on the list of Forbes Global 2000 companies; recognized by Ad Age as one of the top 25 largest agencies in the world; and Consulting Magazine named EPAM Continuum as one of the top 20 fastest-growing consultancies. 10:09 Also included by Forrester as EPAM Continuum in the list of eight largest customer experience strategy consulting practices, along with Accenture, BCG, Deloitte, E&Y, IBM, McKinsey and PwC; named in top 50 most loved workplaces by Newsweek; recognized for our employee-centric work by Great Place to Work in a number of our key talent markets; and was also awarded the Best Culture of Learning Talent by LinkedIn. Just last week was included in the top 100 Barron's Most Sustainable Companies list. And lastly, was accepted in S&P 500 Index in December. Just several quarters ago, in last May actually, we talked probably for the first time about becoming a $5 billion to $10 billion company sometime in the future. 11:07 Today, we know that we are guiding to close the $5 billion mark already in 2022. So we feel much more confident to set our near-term sights on growing to $10 billion floor company. We believe we are well positioned to do so with our overall progress today, and we continue advancing on our key client markets and growing a very fast, diversifying global delivery capabilities. I know it feels like I'm missing one hot topic at this point. And I am sure that you follow the news about Ukraine and Russia as much as we do. That is why I would like to share the following before passing the microphone to Jason. 11:54 2021 was actually a very challenging year, especially for us. First, due to fast-growing geopolitical and social uncertainties across some of our key talent markets and the continued disruption of global pandemic too. That is exactly why we are very pleased with our standing in first quarter and overall performance we delivered in 2021. Despite all of that, our results demonstrate the level of maturity published over the years and our ability to operate and win share performance during difficult times. 12:33 We also should remember that this conflict is not new for the region. We do well remember 2014 and 2015 and then 2020 as well. We have dealt well with those in the past, and we also learned a lot since then. So in 2021, to navigate the situation, we continued something which we started actively implementing since 2014. Both organic and M&A-based efforts to improve our geographic timing diversification and to do it without any degradation in quality of our delivery. 13:09 That was our key focus over those years as well as significantly maturing our portfolio of consulting industry and overall engineering capabilities. So today, we believe we are well prepared to address the challenges ahead in 2022 by leveraging our broad global reach in addition to our deep regional insight and by applying our strong engineering DNA and very importantly, never ending entrepreneurial spirit to continue making the future real for our clients, our employees and our global and local communities while keeping everyone as safe as possible as our key priority at the same time. 13:51 With that I would like one more time to send our employees customers and shareholders for their continuing understanding and support. Now let me turn the call over to Jason.
Jason Peterson: 14:03 Thank you, Ark, and good day to all. In the fourth quarter, EPAM delivered extremely strong results, reflecting continued high levels of demand for the company's services across a full range of industry verticals and geographies. During the quarter, EPAM generated revenues of $1.107 billion, a year-over-year increase of 53.1% on a reported basis and 54.1% in constant currency terms, reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of 100 basis points. 14:34 Q4 was the first quarter EPAM delivered quarterly revenues in excess of $1 billion, a notable milestone in the company's journey. Performance across the industry verticals in the quarter was consistent and very strong, long-standing trends, which have been driving significant growth continue and include the need to modernize and transform applications while transitioning them to the cloud. 14:57 Human-centered innovation is the merging of physical and digital experiences continues to spread across industries and creation of new digital products and businesses, while harnessing the resulting data to improve our customers' revenue growth, supply chain operations and end customer experiences. 15:14 Turning to the performance of our industry verticals. Travel & consumer grew 91.3%, driven by very strong growth from both our consumer and retail clients. The accelerated growth in the quarter is partially the result of recent acquisitions. Financial services grew 60.3% with very strong growth coming from payments, banking, asset management and insurance. Larger consulting-led engagements are helping to drive higher levels of growth. 15:45 Software & hi-tech grew 34.7% in the quarter. Life sciences & healthcare grew 33.9%. Business information & media delivered 32.9% growth in the quarter. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered 67.6% growth, driven by clients in manufacturing and automotive, energy and telecommunications. 16:08 Moving to our geographic performance. In Q4, we renamed our geographic regions to better reflect EPAM's ongoing geographic expansion. These changes are name only, the methodology used to report revenues remains unchanged. The Americas, our largest region, representing 58% of our Q4 revenues, grew 47.2% year-over-year or 47.4% in constant currency. EMEA, representing 35% of Q4 revenues, grew 66.6% year-over-year or 69.7% in constant currency. The accelerated growth in the quarter is partially the result of recent acquisitions. 16:50 CEE, representing 5% of our Q4 revenues, grew 46.4% year-over-year and 43.9% in constant currency. And finally, APAC grew 38% year-over-year and 38% in constant currency terms and now represents 3% of our revenues. In Q4, revenues from our top 20 clients grew 29% while revenues from clients outside our top 20 grew 70% year-over-year, driving greater diversification across our revenue base. Growth in our clients outside of the top 20, most notably below the top 200, reflected a higher level of inorganic contribution during the quarter. 17:35 Moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 34.3% compared to 35.6% in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35.9% compared to 36.9% for the same quarter last year. Gross margin in Q4 2021 was impacted by higher levels of funding for our variable compensation programs, given the company's outperformance versus financial targets established at the beginning of the 2021 fiscal year. 18:06 GAAP SG&A was 17.2% of revenue compared to 17.8% in Q4 of last year, and non-GAAP SG&A came in at 15.6% of revenue compared to 16.2% in the same period last year. GAAP income from operations was $166 million or 15% of revenue in the quarter, compared to $112 million or 15.5% of revenue in Q4 of last year. 18:33 Non-GAAP income from operations was $206 million or 18.6% of revenues in the quarter compared to $136 million or 18.8% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 11% versus our Q4 guide to 14%. Due to a higher than expected level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits was 21.9%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $2.40. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.76, reflecting a 95% increase and 52.5% growth over the same quarter in 2020. In Q4, there were approximately $59.3 million diluted shares outstanding. 19:26 Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q4 was $285 million compared to $159 million in the same quarter of 2020. Free cash flow of $228 million produced a 139% conversion of adjusted net income, compared to free cash flow of $141 million in the same quarter last year. The higher level of free cash flow in the quarter reflects a strong level of cash collections. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which is net of $366 million used in our acquisition efforts during 2021. At the end of Q4, DSO was 62 and compares to 70 days in Q3 2021 and 64 days in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, we expect DSO will trend up in 2022. 20:21 Moving on to a few operational metrics for the quarter. We ended Q4 with more than 52,600 consultants, designers, engineers, trainers and architects, a year-over-year increase of 43.2%. Our total headcount for the quarter was more than 58,800 employees. In Q4, we had approximately 6,100 net additions, a record number of new additions for EPAM. Utilization was 76.8% compared to 77.9% in Q4 of last year and 77.1% in Q3 2021. 21:01 Turning to our results for 2021. Revenues for the year were $3.758 billion, producing 41.3% reported growth and 39.9% on a constant currency basis when compared to 2020. During fiscal 2021, our acquisitions contributed approximately 4% to our growth. GAAP income from operations was $542 million, an increase of 43% year-over-year and represented 14.4% of revenues. Our non-GAAP income from operations was $678 million, an increase of 43.5% over the prior year and represented 18% of revenue. 21:45 Our GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 9.7%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $8.15. Non-GAAP EPS, which excludes adjustments for stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs and other certain onetime items was $9.05, reflecting a 42.7% increase over fiscal 2020. In 2021, there were approximately 59.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 22:18 And finally, cash flow from operations was $572 million compared to $544 million for 2020. And free cash flow was $461 million, reflecting an 86% adjusted net income conversion. We are very pleased with our 2021 results, which exceeded each of the guided metrics we set at the beginning of the year. 22:40 Before I move on to our outlook, I'd like to provide a few highlights on our progress in the area of corporate responsibility and ESG. EPAM has a long-standing commitment to serve the communities in which our people and our customers operate. As we continue to expand, we recognize our responsibility to act according to our principles by operating ethically, protecting the environment and supporting our global and local communities. Our focus on sustainable growth today will be a catalyst to fuel continued expansion in the future. 23:13 Over the last year, EPAMers have donated more than 30,000 hours of their time and skills across 27 EPAM sites and partner organization events, creating and conducting STEM-related courses, supporting social innovation platforms and environmental initiatives and supporting events, including the British Interactive Media Association's Digital Day, the Raspberry Pi Foundation's Coolest Projects and the global Scratch Conference. 23:40 While we are working through specific long-term commitments to fight climate change, we have continued to challenge ourselves to significantly reduce the effects of our carbon emissions. We're also focused on innovating new sustainability concepts and developing digital solutions to support sustainability in our communities. 24:00 Now let's turn to guidance. Starting with our full year outlook, revenue growth will be at least 37% on a reported basis, and in constant currency terms will be at least 38% after factoring in an approximate 1% negative foreign exchange impact. We expect inorganic revenue contribution to be approximately 6% from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months. We expect GAAP income operations to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%, and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. 24:36 We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 15%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation will be 22%. For earnings per share, we expect that GAAP diluted EPS will be in the range of $10.43 to $10.76 for the full year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS will be in the range of $11.36 to $11.69 for the full year. 25:05 We expect weighted average share count of 59.8 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For Q1 of 2022, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.170 billion to $1.180 billion, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 50% reported at the midpoint of the range. Our guidance reflects unfavorable FX impact of 1% and the year-over-year growth rate on a constant currency basis is expected to be 51%. Lastly, we expect approximately 9% of our growth to come from revenues contributed by acquisitions closed over the last 12 months. 25:45 For the first quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 8% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation to be approximately 22%. 26:10 For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.73 for the quarter, and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.58 to $2.66 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59.5 million diluted shares outstanding. 26:31 Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements in 2022. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $116 million with $19 million in Q1, $31 million in Q2 and $33 million in the remaining quarters. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $24 million for the year, evenly spread across each quarter. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $6 million loss for the year, evenly spread across each quarter. 27:06 Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $27 million for the year, with $4 million in Q1, $7 million in Q2 and $8 million in each remaining quarter. And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $67 million for the full year with approximately $27 million in Q1, $18 million in Q2 and $11 million in each remaining quarter. 27:30 Our 2022 outlook reflects the strong demand environment we see across the business and end markets we serve. In addition to expected ongoing investments across our people, platforms and processes, which will equip and position EPAM for future growth. As we've done in the past, we will adjust our business outlook each quarter to reflect changes in the demand environment and in our operations. Okay, operator, let's open the call for questions.
Operator: 28:02 Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.
Ramsey El-Assal: 28:18 Hi, and thanks so much for taking my call. And congratulations on your anniversary. I wanted to ask about the situation in Ukraine, whether you could give us a little more color on your potential continuity plans in the event that the conflict there sort of escalated and also maybe we've in whether the post pandemic remote work, model has made it a little bit easier to contemplate, shifting workloads around?
Arkadiy Dobkin: 28:49 Hello, this is Arkadiy. I think number one that we continue to work in normal environment, there is not any impact on day-to-day operation at this point. So we talked about our experience started from 2014. And in 2015, actually, it was active operations on the border with Ukraine and was questionable part of the lens there, and it was a very active military activities there. During all this time, it didn't have any impact on the EPAM operation. What we can bring, in addition to what you're reading, that nobody from EPAM and right now, it's a pretty big number of people. We have almost 13,000 production people in the country. So we have anybody who is drafted or anybody who is invited or requested for any type of military training or drills or anything. So that's probably kind of additional color, which we can bring. 30:13 The second point that also since almost eight years of tension in the region, we did a lot of special preparations for this, like we practically completely independent from local infrastructure, any project infrastructure -- any project activities, so -- and on top of your question about COVID and remote work. So it means that from building of any attributes of engagement depending on Lacao, it doesn't -- practically it doesn't exist. I think it will be a lot of questions, so I will add a little bit more to it. There is not any active relocations. Probably from the total number of people, we should have between 50 and 100 participated right now in some kind of pilots or testing of BCP activities. And we are living for -- in the past or currently for one, two, three weeks to [Indiscernible]. So other than that, again, it's completely normal.
Ramsey El-Assal: 31:53 Okay. I appreciate that. And I wanted to ask also on margin guidance in fiscal '22. It's down about 50 basis points at the midpoint from the fiscal '21 guide. And I know you mentioned investing in people and ops. I was just wondering if you can give a little bit more color about the margin drivers and maybe the cadence we should model through this year.
Jason Peterson: 32:18 Yes. So maybe what I'll do is I'll respond to the full year, and I'll also talk about Q1 specifically. And so what we continue to see is a business that obviously is growing at a rapid rate with extremely strong demand. We've talked about our ongoing investment in sort of people on processes, education and also just the ongoing diversification of the business globally as we grow into different centers around the world. Those are probably somewhat less optimized at this time than our more mature kind of traditional geographies. But if I were really sort of provide color that's probably easiest to understand is that we continue to see elevated wage inflation, not maybe significantly higher than 2021, but maybe somewhat elevated as we go from 2021 to 2022. We, at the same time, are also seeing substantially better pricing environment. But the pricing does not fully offset the impact of the wage inflation. So one of the negatives you've got here is that ongoing impact 33:11 At the same time, I think that you'll see a little bit more normalization of activities related to travel related to in-person. And so I think you'll see a little bit higher SG&A over time. We've talked about the fact that the variable compensation is going to come off a bit or we expect that it would come off a little bit between 2021 and 2022. But right now, between the somewhat ongoing impact of the wage inflation and pricing, not totally sort of compensating in what I expected somewhat elevated SG&A for the full year, we've guided to 16.5% to 17.5%, and I believe that we'll probably operate at the midpoint or somewhat higher than the midpoint of the 16% to 17.5% guide. 34:17 However, I want to be a little clearer on Q1 basis points between Q4 and Q1. And you see them every year you go back and look at history where profitability particularly gross margin has declined by between 100 basis points and sometimes 200 basis points between Q4 and Q1. And so the first of those is that we just have a lot lower billing capacity or billing days in Q1. And again, it's somewhat the uniqueness of where we operate, which is we have an awful lot of people celebrating Orthodox Christmas, which occurs in January, not in December. There are a lot more holidays in the region. And so you've got lower availability of workdays in January and then February is a short month for any company. So that has an impact on profitability when you get a highly time and materials oriented business. 35:07 The other thing, and again, this would impact any company, not just EPAM. But you've got social security caps that usually kick in, in the second half of a fiscal year. And then those social security resets at the beginning of the year, you have much higher employer social security payments, particularly in Q1. So both of those things have a pretty negative impact on -- particularly on gross margin. And so when we do the modeling today, okay, again, for the full year, I would say that, that midpoint, we can be somewhat higher than the midpoint. However, for Q1, I would say, when I look at the midpoint of 16.5% to 17.5%, I would say at or slightly below the midpoint is the modeling that we're doing for Q1 of fiscal 2022.
Ramsey El-Assal: 35:55 Super helpful, thank you.
Operator: 35:59 Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open.
Bryan Bergin: 36:05 Hi, good morning. Thank you. First, I wanted to follow-up on Ukraine. Can you just talk about the nature of client conversations and whether there's any increased selectivity or preference by them for where new work will be delivered from and then collectively, we see that Belarus and Ukraine as a mix of headcount declined year-over-year by a noble amount. Just based on your global expansion plans, how are you thinking about the mix of those two countries as you would exit this year?
Arkadiy Dobkin: 36:36 Okay. I think in general, the action and conversation very, very similar to what was eight years back. There are some clients which very worried and kind of situation, wait and see. There are some clients which continue as usual, and this is majority of them. There are some clients who are preparing for more active BCP if some specific triggers would happen, which is very difficult to define the figures. And this is a very small minority. 37:16 So -- and the risk category between those like especially in wait and see, which prefer to start somewhere else. And it was a very similar situation again, eight years ago. And we have many more options today to work an alternative because as you know, [Indiscernible] what's happening. To be in Belarus and Russia today, so probably around 5% of our delivery capacity versus eight years ago, it was probably over seven.
Bryan Bergin: 38:12 Okay. Okay. And then as far as workforce goes and just the -- another big addition here this quarter sequentially, I think we estimate over 4,000 organically again. Can you just talk about your comfort levels in the pace of resource additions and kind of what you're anticipating attrition utilization within that 2022 outlook?
Jason Peterson: 38:35 Yes. So let me provide a little bit of color on that and also kind of follow up on one of the other questions you had earlier. And so you're correct that we've seen a significant growth in our productive capabilities outside of the traditional Ukraine, Belarus region. So to be specific, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia from a production standpoint grew by 22% on a year-over-year basis between '20 and '21. And we had greater than 80%, almost 90% growth in the other regions, including India and Latin America, where we've seen particularly high growth. And so we've moved from a Ukraine, Belarus, Russia. And again, the idea was that we're becoming an increasingly global company, where we're larger, we need to have a broader pool of labor that we access. At the same time, it clearly has diversification benefits from a risk standpoint. So we've gone from 68% of production capacity in Ukraine and Belarus in 2020 to 58%. We expect to continue to see accelerated growth, particularly in places like Latin America, Eastern Europe, let's call it, Central Europe and APAC. And as a result, you'll continue to see -- I expect you'll continue to see that number drive down. So I don't know if it would approach 50% or something, but certainly it would be lower than it is today and certainly much lower than it was in 2020. 40:02 From an attrition and utilization standpoint, I think we see utilization at about the same level as 2021. And then from an attrition standpoint, we are still below 20% with both voluntary and involuntary as we exit Q4. We generally would see a little bit of benefit in Q1 as people wait to get vesting of stock and bonus. So you usually see a little bit of a dip in attrition in Q1. And for the full year, we think attrition might be up slightly. But at the same time, we expect that 2022 attrition will definitely remain below 20% as well.
Bryan Bergin: 40:45 Thank you for the color.
Jason Peterson: 40:47 Sure.
Operator: 40:48 Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
James Faucette: 40:54 Great. Just continue to ask about kind of situation and flexibility. If we think about operationally, if there were a disruption or you needed to move out of kind of the region where you're seeing potential disruption out of Ukraine, et cetera, how flexible are you and how quickly can you move those operations into other regions for delivery, et cetera, just thinking about those contingency plans? And then separately on pricing. Jason, you mentioned that the wage increases aren't keeping -- or are moving faster than you can move pricing. Is there a time frame under which you can better balance those and fully recapture kind of what you're experiencing from a wage inflation perspective in your pricing with your customers? Thanks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: 41:53 On the first part of the first question, first of all, there is no one kind of approach or rule how to operate in this situation because we have BCP plans, which were [Indiscernible] engagements or accounts or even specific engagement within these accounts, depending on risk factors, distribution of the team, infrastructure on general part like the mix of clients and us, again, it's independent from Ukraine. But still, there are some specifics there. So it is very, very specific. And those plans is very detailed, including like definition of the key personnel and timing on doing this. Also, it is pretty pragmatic because we were experiencing the pressure and very real events eight years ago and then during this period, multiple escalation as well. It wasn't so much covered by media as happening today, but it was very, very similar. 43:28 So we feel that we're pretty prepared for this. We also have our understanding again from a lot of local science, which is again not necessarily exactly in line with what we're reading on synergy. And our understanding of what could happen is relatively limited across the boarder in Ukraine, and we have a number of large development centers across Ukraine. So we have plans how to move people from one to another, farther from the border if necessary. At the same time, again, we do believe that even those, which is closer to the border, still in pretty kind of safe zone today and will be in the future. So I think a specific timing in triggering that's very specific to clients and engagements.
Jason Peterson: 44:21 Yes. And on the pricing question, we continue to focus on both rate increases with existing clients and then taking new opportunities where the value EPAM quality delivery is such that the pricing is also somewhat superior, so a little bit more selective in terms of the deals that we take. I think that what -- clearly, what wage inflation is going to be at the end of 2022, it's kind of hard to predict at the beginning of 2022. But I think what you'll continue to see is sort of price not just at the beginning of the year and also in Q2, but we'll continue to see sort of price improvements throughout the year. And hopefully, by the time we get to 2023, there's a better balance between price and wage inflation.
Operator: 45:17 Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America, your line is open.
Jason Kupferberg: 45:22 Good morning, guys. So in 2021, you guys just posted I guess it was 36% revenue growth, organic, constant currency, or guiding to least 22%, or sorry, at least 32% on the same basis in 2022. So it's just the incredibly strong growth seems like it's continuing to persist. I mean, how do you now think about your true kind of underlying organic revenue growth rate on kind of a multiyear basis? I mean, we used to talk about 20% plus, and, obviously, there's been a surge in demand from the pandemic, but just as you've assessed, how long that that may last, and how your competitive position has evolved would really be curious on your thoughts on what do you think normalized growth, looks like even beyond 2022?
Jason Peterson: 46:18 Yeah, So let me just -- to I guess, restate what you said. Absolutely correct that in a 37% growth guide, the organic constant currency contribution would be about 32%. That compares to the 35.5-ish kind of percent organic constant currency contribution or growth rate in 2021. So what you've seen in 2021 and also as we enter 2022, is we've had three quarters now if you include the guide for Q1 of 2022, where we're 50% year-over-year revenue growth rates. And so clearly, that's an extraordinary number. Part of that has been the result of the huge additional headcount additions on an organic basis, plus some of the acquisition-related activity. 47:09 So we don't think that 50% year-over-year revenue growth rate is sustainable. And I think if you sort of decompose the guide with the growth rate in Q1 and the guidance that we have for the full year, you'll see that we would expect a deceleration in growth rate throughout the year. But even as you exit Q4, I think you're going to see us with a growth rate, including acquisitions, in excess of 25%. So I think what you would do is you would exit Q4 with a somewhat accelerated growth rate relative to the historic above 20%, and we'll get to the guide for 2023 as we get closer to that time period. But again, you would see somewhat of a decelerating growth rate throughout the year, and that is somewhat intentional. We believe that it's appropriate to get back to a more sustainable growth rate. But I still think you'll see us exit Q4 at a growth rate that is higher than that traditional somewhat above 20%
Jason Kupferberg: 48:10 Right, right. Okay. Yeah, no, that all makes sense. And then if we think about your headcount growth targets for the year, obviously, you're going to have some pricing to help on the on the revenue side. So should we think about headcount growth, kind of modestly, lagging revenue growth in 2022?
Jason Peterson: 48:32 Ark, are you something you want to say, sponsored?
Arkadiy Dobkin: 48:37 I just wanted to address on -- I think the main kind of lesson right now that we thought about growth in 20 plus percent before and what happened during the last year that we tested ourselves at a much higher level. So we still have to wait and see an expectation that we'll come to a more normal growth rates in the future. But where this border will be coming on 20%, 25% to 25%, 30% or whatever, we will need to test it. But again, we feel more comfortable to answer now the question, which we were asked in the past. Would you be able to grow faster than what you were saying in the past? Yes, it is possible, and that's what we probably kind of positive lesson which we have right now.
Jason Peterson: 49:35 And yes, I guess for the growth rates, one of the things that you see when you've got this organic growth rate of -- from a headcount standpoint of greater than 4,000 in Q3 and Q4 plus, of course, the acquisitions that we've done. By the time you get to Q1 and Q2, it does produce very, very high growth. Again, particularly on a year-over-year basis, we are comparing Q1 of 2022 to Q1 of 2021, and you've had all that headcount addition in the second half of 2021. Right now, what we -- the last two quarters, we've had organic headcount growth of about 4,000 or somewhat over 4,000. And right now, what we're planning is for organic head count growth somewhat above 3,000, okay, with the idea that we believe that, that might be a more sustainable growth rate for the time being. And that still produces the strong growth rates that we're talking about, the 37% plus for the full year 2022.
Jason Kupferberg: 50:39 Great, well, thanks throughout the year for that.
Operator: 50:43 Thank you. Our next question comes from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Surinder Thind: 50:51 Thank you. A question about kind of the breadth of demand that you guys are seeing at this point. Obviously, even if we adjust out the acquisitions, very strong growth outside the top 20 in terms of your clients. Can you maybe talk about the pace at which you're adding new clients and the considerations when you onboard those clients? How selective do you have to be in the current environment? Or how selective are you? And what are the considerations? Are these all clients that you believe that will get to $5 million in revenues at some point? Or how should we think about the trade-offs of having the breadth of clients versus a strategy that's maybe focused on EPAM becoming more ingrained with a larger percentage of a given clients' revenues?
Jason Peterson: 51:47 So we're definitely more selective than in the past, and definitely the new clients, which, in our view, when we review this is much high potential. And we have probably a dozen of clients which we landed during the last 12 months, which already bring in at least one million per quarter and growing fast. So I think it's actually becoming much more strategic portfolio, so. But you are continuing to see that traditional EPAM growth in existing customers. And as Ark said, continued growth level from new customers, but maybe we're a little bit more strategic and selective about the new customers that we bring in to EPAM. The other thing I think we're hearing is demand continues to be probably still in somewhat of the unprecedented camp. Maybe clients are a little bit more thoughtful around their budgets, but again, still strong, strong desire to invest, and there's still an awful lot of work to do, and again, continues to be very broad-based across industry verticals.
Arkadiy Dobkin: 52:57 Having more and more clients, which is reason like 12, 24 months becoming our top shift to, or even top 20 as well.
Jason Peterson: 53:07 Yeah. And that speaks to I think, clients, and we keep hearing this, when we do our channel checks internally, clients are looking at EPAM differently as a true transformation partner with the ability to take on projects of much greater sort of scale and scope.
Surinder Thind: 53:24 Got it. And then would the reverse be true in the situation if you're being more selective that you're turning away business at this point?
Jason Peterson: 53:34 I mean I wouldn't say that we're turning away business. But I mean, I think there's been a disconnect between supply and demand for the last probably 1.5 years or certainly throughout 2021. And so by definition, you are being somewhat selective. I think in some cases, Ark said it well, right, is that we're looking for clients that have the potential to grow. Sometimes, we're obviously looking for very interesting projects or programs. We're looking for clients who have sufficient funding, and we're also looking for clients who are willing to pay the rates that we've been talking about when it comes to price. And so all those things would factor in, and there'll be some self-selecting by clients and obviously, some self-selecting by EPAM as to which clients we do business with.
Surinder Thind: 54:23 Got it.
Arkadiy Dobkin: 54:25 Okay. It seems like -- let me rephrase it. Like first of all, from the general portfolio configuration, we're still looking for some clients, which as in the past, allowing us to really work in the very much cutting edge of technology and improve our engineering kind of capabilities and understanding what's happening because that's the skills which we strategically focused in the past, right now and will be doing in the future, and we hope that it differentiates us. At the same time, I think our criteria is changing. It's criteria changing not only because of the environment because of the size of operation and general direction of the company where we can refer now much more end-to-end study from consulting to engineering. And we're looking for some clients, which actually looking for somebody who can speed up the whole continuum kind of transformation. So -- and with all these criteria together, definitely, there is very different selection retails. And some clients, which will be working in the past, we probably not bring in work today.
Surinder Thind: 55:43 Got it. And then in terms of just a follow-on in terms of the questions around geopolitical risk. When you kind of look ahead, is there any acceleration in your view of -- or perhaps acceleration towards investing towards building global delivery capabilities faster? Or do you kind of just kind of continue at the current pace, given that obviously, you cited rates earlier where you are building the -- a large percentage of your capability is already out there. Do you accelerate that? Or do you just kind of keep going?
Arkadiy Dobkin: 56:22 I think we do pretty obvious acceleration. But you also need -- we also need to consider that it's not only because of geopolitical risk. It's in general, and that's why we try today kind of to give you perspective what's happened during the last 10 years from 7,000 people to 58,000 people. So it's not only about geopolitics, it's in general the globalization of our services. And we started to do it back then 10 years ago, very big acceleration happened in 2014, '15, when we practically opened India and Latin America, and India and Latin America growing right now faster than Eastern Europe. So both criteria is important. And as Jason mentioned already before, by the end of this year, probably depending on our core locations, we will be closer to 50% versus 80-plus percent, which we have 10 years back.
Surinder Thind: 57:34 Got it? That's helpful. Thank you. Those are my questions.
Jason Peterson: 57:37 Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: 57:39 Our next question comes from Maggie Nolan with William Blair, your line is open.
Maggie Nolan: 57:43 Thank you, congratulations. Ark, you dangled this kind of $10 billion company in front of us, I'm wondering what remains consistent about the company, as you get to that level, and then what operationally or strategically would be significantly different until $10 billion, or as you get to $10 billion?
Arkadiy Dobkin: 58:09 First of all, we're doing it in front of us, not only in front of you. And I think it's a lot of criteria there. And we talked about all of them over the last years. We building company, which becoming more end-to-end solution provider, and this sounds very trivial, but how to do it well, it's much less still than it seems to because we believe that it's still open opportunity to do it right, and this is continuous inflow of the talent. So we need to like to find a way how to grow the talent, and that's a very big component of our ecosystem education, digital platform, how to make sure that people from different sites working together efficiently. So it's a lot of simple things, which have to come together in our view because it is a very competitive market. And while we're thinking the $10 billion is very realistic, how to do it better is still the challenge. I think it's a very separate conversation. Hopefully, we will be able to answer this a little bit in more details in May when we're going to do our Investor Day.
Maggie Nolan: 59:39 Okay, thanks. And then I think, Jason, I think it was you that mentioned that consulting was a one of the drivers behind the growth in financial services, is that widespread across the business? And then when you first rolled out consulting, it wasn't billed separately, and you would caution us to think about it as something that would be driving margins up, has that changed as your consulting capabilities have matured over the last several years?
Arkadiy Dobkin: 60:07 I think it's not only about financial services. So it's happening in multiple sectors and less time selling [Indiscernible] in retail right now. So and for us girls to know to have a separate consult consultant client. Services, but actually very much integrated and we still don't have very specific separate kind of accounting for this because it's not just specific number of people in this category. It's very much overlap, across department, we have consultant capabilities and very different organizational units of report and as a whole effort how to orchestrate that correctly it was right before. So from this point of view, nothing change at this point.
Maggie Nolan: 61:04 Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: 61:08 Thank you.
Operator: 61:09 Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: 61:14 Thank you. Ark and Jason, good morning. Congratulations on the quarter and the milestone. Good journey. Happy to be along on it. I guess my first question is, when I look at every single revenue bucket cohort has grown. So you have clients over $20 million, between $10 million and $20 million, between $5 million and so on, all of them have grown, which is obviously a good thing. But it leads to the question of sort of what is sort of the serviceable market opportunity in front of you from the current set of clients, just from increasing penetration, could you perhaps help quantify or put a direction on that, if you could?
Jason Peterson: 62:16 Yes, I probably couldn't do anything more than just kind of anecdotally. But even in our largest customers, there's -- in our top 10 or top 20, there's a significant opportunity across a range of those customers for significant ongoing growth. Certainly, in some of the areas which are kind of established for many companies, but still somewhat newer areas for EPAM. I think insurance we're still very early days in terms of our penetration of those accounts. So there's a significant opportunity there. In financial services, you're continuing to see growth in existing banks, new banks, wealth management, asset management and very, very high growth in insurance. Healthcare and life sciences continues to be a significant growth opportunity for the company with both existing and new clients. And then certainly, as you look at the emerging, as I talked about in the past, manufacturing and logistics for us is not even a breakout. It's still kind of part of our emerging verticals. And so I don't think the story has changed that much in that there continues to be a significant growth opportunity with existing customers. And then a lot of those new customers that Ark talked about that are already at $10 million or more per quarter, there's significant wallet opportunity in those new customers.
Arkadiy Dobkin: 63:33 And I think you're asking how much we have kind of run rate from existing client base. And I think we do believe that it's a huge opportunity exactly present in our existing clients. And it seems like -- and it's probably not -- it's probably true for many other vendors today that after COVID kind of the new life was discovered in old clients. It was a lot of concern like two years ago and then some of them started to behave differently from our expectation because as we were sharing before, most of them understand the total investment, which were done in digital before probably not enough or should already be done because the situation around has changed so much. So there is a very big part from existing client base. That's why we have to be very selective who will be bringing on top of them as a new logos.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: 64:39 Understood, understood. The other question I had was, obviously, this is a multi-year trend, not necessarily a new thing, but as gross margins, steadily have gone towards the mid-30s. It’s pretty clear SG&A offset to that and sort of a two part question, if you could kind of break down the gross margin, is that more a function of adding capabilities? Then wage inflation gets added to the mix incrementally? How does that change and for how long the hell perhaps the SG&A offset capability, so that operating margins continued to get delivered?
Jason Peterson: 65:26 Yes. So I have kind of, I guess, about a 5-year history with the company. And I remember when -- to be quite honest, we struggled to sort of stay above 16% profitability. So here, when we're guiding to 16.5% to 17.5% with the possibility of being, let's say, somewhat above the 17% for 2022, it feels still like a pretty good place. You are right that gross margins have declined over time. Some of what's happened over the last couple of years really has been the whole kind of wage inflation in the market, which I think is unprecedented and probably can't last forever. So I do think you might see stabilization at some point in the future, hard to speculate when. Some of it would be the additional capabilities. And specifically, I would say, the new geographies. So again, if we were just to grow in our historic Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and continue to sort of focus on optimizing the cost effectiveness of those delivery locations, you might see a somewhat different gross margin profile, but you would also see a different sort of growth potential. And so I think it really has been beneficial. But at the same time, it probably has come with a little bit of moderation. 66:36 The other thing I don't think I totally called out is that our recent acquisitions, in many cases, are operating more in the low teens and in some cases, the single digits from an adjusted IFO standpoint. And that puts a little bit of downward pressure, particularly on the 2022 results where we've got greater acquisition-related revenue. The SG&A, I think, will continue to stay low in part because I do think facilities as a cost is going to continue to be a benefit. And so I do expect, as we exit the fiscal year, that we'd still kind of be below 16%. And so I think the balance of those things allows the company to potentially operate somewhat above 17% in 2022, and I think that's not a bad place to be with a 37% plus growth rate.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: 67:23 Clearly, I agree with that. Thank you.
Jason Peterson: 67:26 Thank you.
Operator: 67:28 Our last question comes from David Grossman with Stifel, your line is open.
David Grossman: 67:33 Thank you. I was hoping I'd just ask two really quick follow-ups to some of the questions that have been asked. So the first is on the growth of the cohorts. Outside of the top 20, it's accelerated. It's been accelerating all year. I guess my interpretation of that dynamic was that there was a resource allocation decision that had to be made during the pandemic. And now that things have kind of changed a little bit from a resourcing standpoint, that you've been able now to pursue growth outside the top 20, which historically has actually been one of the major contributors to your growth rates. So is there any really anything different going on there or maybe I'm missing something here?
Jason Peterson: 68:16 Yes, I would say yes, yes to that thesis. And then the other piece is the recent acquisitions have incorporated clients that are generally below the top 20 and in some cases, below the top 200. And so that has also contributed to the growth. But certainly, I think particularly deep in the pandemic, much of the resources were consumed by a handful of clients. And obviously, that's changed throughout 2021.
David Grossman: 68:45 Right. Okay. And then just to follow up on the situation in the Ukraine. Historically in geopolitical hotspots, the issue is getting people to work or transportation and disruption to that and infrastructure with clients having fairly sophisticated global risk management strategies of their own before they even decide to put work over to different geographic areas. So you seem to have addressed with work from home, the getting to work kind of risk seems to have diminished and you've got your own infrastructure. So you grew through the last crisis, we all remember that. So are the risks in this current situation any different kind of what they've been historically? Is there anything different about the situation that we should be thinking about?
Arkadiy Dobkin: 69:37 David, you know you're asking pretty difficult question because like big guys cannot answer. And at the same time, we definitely went through multiple geopolitical kind of tensions and crises during the last, not even 10 years, which has started to share today kind of what, 20-plus years. And in my view, from our operational point of view, there is not much difference. And -- but the only answer we will get like probably in another three months or maybe nine months or maybe in 24 months. But from work which we're doing, I think impact would be very, very minimal, in my opinion. And also, what also in this specific like history was telling us that even if some clients' policies and risk mitigation actions will be changing the direction, in general, the kind of demand for the talent is so big that we are pretty sure that we will be operating in the countries where we are today, like years from now, and it would be in the talent in demand. And that's exactly what happened. Again, for example, eight years ago, one or two clients where it was too difficult for them to swallow the situation, practically immediately different clients were willing to accept the [Indiscernible] kind of efforts which we bring in from the region.
Jason Peterson: 71:30 And I would just say, David, that the guidance for the full year also concludes that any impact would be minimal, and so that's the basis for our guidance.
Arkadiy Dobkin: 71:39 But we -- but again, we cannot predict the future. So the history, and we have -- as you know, we have pretty interesting configuration of our management team, which have a lot of experience in the regions and on cruises over the years.
David Grossman: 72:04 Right. So it sounds so that the client response to the crisis has been really -- I mean, I'm sure there are differences here and there. But if you aggregate it all together, it sounds like the response hasn't been terribly dissimilar to what you experienced here.
Arkadiy Dobkin: 72:22 Because like, yes, I can tell you that at this point, probably eight years ago, it was more difficult situation from some client reactions. I think it's much more balanced this time. As I said, we have some pilots for BCP, but it's very, very minimal right now.
David Grossman: 72:44 Right. Okay. Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: 72:48 Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Arkadiy Dobkin for closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: 72:54 Okay. Thank you again, everybody, and I hope it was not necessarily usual call today and first of all, because we celebrated just 10 years of our IPO, but also recently challenged simultaneously. And as I just shared, we have a strong team. We went through crisis, and we do believe that it's just one of them, and we probably will have some in the future as well. Pretty sure about it. So thank you and talk to you in three months.
Jason Peterson: 73:34 Thank you.
Operator: 73:35 This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-04 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the EPAM Systems Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
David Straube: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company’s third quarter 2021 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on todays’ call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today’s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described in the company’s earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website. With that said, I’ll now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I think it would make sense to start today from the same reference point we used exactly 12 months ago, when we began to see the first positive turning signs after the pandemic hit us earlier in 2020. The difference point was our investor and analyst day which took place November 2019 in Boston, which was still done in the old fashioned in person setting. On that day, we were reminded about EPAM history during our post a few years, and our transformational journey from -- software engineering services firm to much more diverse, digital and product consultancy with a strong engineering culture. Beginning in 2016, we set an aspirational goal to become one of the global leaders in product development services. Three years later, in 2016, we set out another one to become one of the global leaders in product and platform engineering services. We said that practically every three years we focused on the way of our means to evolve as an organization without earnings [ph] as the specific elements that were essential to transforming the company. This undertakings enable us to innovate, remain relevant and stay ahead in the ever changing market during those initial post IPO times. Each aspirational mission was done as a legend forehand in a longer journey of transformation, and was validated by external views, namely industry analyst versions, a sector and our ability to grow significantly faster than the market, which has resulted in doubling the company revenue practically every three years. In result, with our Investor & Analyst Day in 2019, we shared our aspiration for the next three years, target and actually the end of 2021 and softly indicated that we might be able to double the size of the [indiscernible]. We also stated then that to achieve this goal, we will need to continue transforming EPAM into a different company with a strong ability to adapt people platforms and processes into those that quickly respond to change built in bring to life the digital platform that connects our people to work seamlessly, and enables us to be efficient and effective in all what we do, extend our leadership across integrated consulting and engineering services, and in result, open opportunities for transformation for everybody, anywhere through lead generation deliver educational, social, and innovation problems. In short, we set our sights on becoming the transformation platform for those clients who would like to become adaptive enterprises themselves, with events [ph] indeed, our current undertaken today as well. So last year, on our Q3 earnings call, we were reminded of all that and shared a good level of optimism, or self-confidence, if you will, that we would be returning to our traditional 20 plus percent organic growth rate in post pandemic environment. But we also were almost certain at that point. That doubling our 2018 revenue by the end of 2021 would not be a realistic target anymore, is everything we experience in Q2 and Q3 of last year, and how the in general saw the situation for 2021 -- in November of 2020. Now as we sit here today, we see how naive our post pandemic assumptions were just a year ago, especially regarding the post pandemic term itself. I guess, we will be aligning today that we can drop the post portion for this term for some time in the future. But on the other side, we are now realizing that EPAM is an exciting crossroads in his 28 year journey because we're looking at the present. We have clear line of sight to the fiscal year we should be one of the fastest growing revenue years in our post IPO history. That includes also breaking through to our first million dollar revenue quarter at the end of 2021. And actually, still reaching out our aspirational goal of doubling the company for the third time since 2012. This result is intersection of many factors that have led us to our current state and the next phase of our journey. It is a journey that has been as much about transforming EPAM as it has been about helping our clients refer themselves. It is exactly through this latest ambition, this research and wisdom that we are developing ourselves to be one of the best in the areas of innovation and design, consulting, education and social responsibility. In addition to driving even higher levels of excellence is one of the strongest engineering companies in our space. And today, EPAM is substantially different company than you were just six eight years ago. One of the much more diverse foundations to drive the next level, so value to the clients and our growth result. So along the way, we said to and will continue to solve for the challenges of scaling for growth, geographical expansions and attracting new types of talent, the means different experiences and different types of syncing to EPAM, while complementing our strong technical and engineering teams. Additionally, at each conference, with identify and compare capabilities that we needed to strengthen or build, in order to transform EPAM to serve the market needs. And to be done in both ways organically and through acquisitions, which continue to be an important part of our capability extension strategy. As we turn to the future, and set our sights on growing to $10 billion revenue company, our growth will come from the foundational building blocks we have assembled over the last few years. Some of each include an integrated consulting and engineering questionings. This brings together business and strategy, technology and experience consultant growth to the market through our EPAM continue [indiscernible]. High value cloud services focused on cloud native development, application of the organisation enabling the data driven enterprise helping our customers modernize, grow from inside out. Data and AI everywhere, leveraging our strong advances, engineering and data heritage, billions of massive data structures and leveraging API technologies to drive fast insights. And enabled is our global talent pools, connected by our digital platforms, guided by our next generation delivery methodologies and supported by educational, social, and innovation initiatives. Lastly, we will continue to focus on expanding our partner record system aligned with our vision and map with our vertical and geographical focus developing joint solutions and go into market together. So pivot into the current moment. As I mentioned a short time ago, acquisitions will continue to be a prominent part of EPAM capabilities and geographical extension strategy. This year, we have already closed on five acquisitions, which are enabling us to expand our current -- in Salesforce cybersecurity, analytics, strategic consulting, and our presence in Latin America. You also might have seen recent regulatory filings about our intentions to acquire in Emakina Group. Emakina is globally recognized digital marketers and experienced agency or how they call themselves the user agency specializing in a range of areas, including commerce and retail, media planning and buying, service design, branding and content production across a number of others, headquartered in Belgium, and has more than 1100 employees and studios across 18 countries in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and North America. This acquisition will intensify my ability to deliver creative solutions, personalized experience and next generation digital products, which are increasingly working into our global clients. So worth noting that while EPAM is already listed among Ad Age’s top 25 largest agencies in the world, Emakina will add very new capabilities to our agency working and significantly strengthen EPAM in market positioning across Europe and Middle East. It seems like it's the right moment now to mention that just a few days ago, Fortune Magazine published the hundred fastest growing companies list for 2021 and included EPAM in the first time and third consecutive year, ranking us 25th overall and the number one in the Information Technology Services category. Of not, we are actually the only IT services company on the list. And in addition, Newsweek included EPAM for the first time in the 2021 America's Most Loved Workplace position us as the number 49 on the list. So before turning to Jason to provide an update on our third quarter results and our 2021 outlook, while I would like one more time to state, the demand for our services continues to be very strong. And we see this across all market segments. We also very well understand this is an overall strong demand requirement. And this is precisely why we feel we cannot become overly confident. We need to continuously build in on our breath and continuously investing in our strong engineering culture, while constantly expanding our services into real end to end, higher complexity engagements across the globe to bring unquestionable loyalty to the clients. We understand that everything about our future high growth is [Indiscernible]. But as before, we are not shy to push into new areas, because they are challenging. And we are committed to do so in a very thoughtful and sustainable way. So it's not to compromise on the quality of the delivery as EPAM is known for, and if anything, we are constantly looking for ways to establish through differentiation for not only our customers, but also as importantly for EPAM. With that, let me turn the call over to Jason.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark. And good morning everyone. In the third quarter, EPAM delivered very strong results, reflecting continued significant demand for the company's services across a wide range of industry verticals and geographies. During the quarter, EPAM generated revenues of $988.5 million, a year-over-year increase of 51.6% on a reported basis, and 50.7% in constant currency terms, reflecting a positive foreign change impact of 90 basis points. A continued robust demand environment, combined with our ability to recruit at record levels, while retaining talent drove a higher than expected revenue result for the quarter. Customers continue to turn to EPAM for help transforming their businesses. We continue to support our customers across a range of initiatives, including, modernizing and transforming applications across the full range of industries we serve, creating new digital products and businesses and harnessing the resulting data to improve revenue growth, supply chain operations and customer experiences, and finally merging physical and digital to create superior retail experiences. Turning to the performance of our industry verticals. Travel and consumer grew 79.3% driven by very strong growth from both our consumer and retail clients. In addition, we saw renewed demand and return to growth across our travel customers. Financial Services grew 68.9% with very strong broad based growth coming from asset management, insurance, payments, and banking. Software and hi-tech grew 46.6% in the quarter. Life sciences and healthcare grew 29.5%. Business information and media delivered 23.6% growth in the quarter. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered 61.5% growth driven by clients and telecommunications, energy, manufacturing and automotive. From a geographic perspective, North America our largest region representing 60% of Q3 revenues grew 51.6% year-over-year, or 51.4% in constant currency. Europe representing 33% of our Q3 revenues grew 50.9% year-over-year, or 49.5% in constant currency. CIS, representing 4% of our Q3 revenues grew 49.7% year-over-year, and 44.6% in constant currency. And finally, APAC grew 60.4% year-over-year or 58% in constant currency terms, and now represents 3% of our revenues. In Q3, revenues from our top 20 Customers grew 29% while revenues from clients outside our top 20 grew 69% resulting in greater diversification across our revenue base. Moving down the income statement, our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 33.9% compared to 35.1% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35.1% compared to 36.8% for the same quarter last year. Gross margin in Q3 2021 was impacted by higher levels of funding for our variable compensation programs, given the company's outperformance versus targets established at the beginning of the 2021 fiscal year. GAAP SG&A was 17.1% of revenue compared to 17.9% in Q3 of last year. And Non-GAAP SG&A came in at 15.3% of revenue compared to 15.9% in the same period last year. GAAP income from operations was $144.1 million, or 14.6% of revenue in the quarter, compared to $96.4 million or 14.8% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $179.6 million, or 18.2% of revenue in the quarter compared to $123.3 million or 18.9% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 14.6% versus our Q3 guide of 13%. Due to a lower than expected level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and a one-time benefit related to certain tax credits. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits, and includes the one-time benefit of the tax credit was 21%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.95. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.42, reflecting a $0.77 increase or 46.7% growth over the same quarter in 2020. In Q3, there were approximately 59.2 million diluted shares outstanding. Now turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operations for Q3 was $206.1 million, compared to $175.6 million in the same quarter of 2020. Free cash flow of $184.9 million produced 129% conversion of adjusted net income compared to free cash flow of $165.8 million in the same quarter last year. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which did not include the restricted cash related to the acquisition of the Emakina Group. Additionally in October, we updated and expanded our unsecured credit facility, which will allow for up to 700 million in funding plus an additional 300 million via Accordion, giving us access to a total of 1 billion in borrowing capacity. This new credit facility replaces the 2017 facility, which allowed for borrowing up to 300 million with an additional 100 million via Accordion. At the end of Q3, DSL was 70 days and compares to 70 days for both Q2 2021 and the same quarter last year. We expect to maintain DSL around the same level or somewhat lower in Q4. Moving on to a few operational metrics, we ended the quarter with more than 47,050 consultants, designers and engineers, a year-over-year increase of 39.4%. Our total headcount for Q3 was more than 52,650 employees. In the first three quarters of 2021, we had approximately 11,500 net additions, a record number for EPAM over a nine month period. Utilization was 77.1% compared to 78.2% in Q3 of last year, and 82.2% in Q2, 2021. Now let's turn the guidance. Based on a year-to-date results combined with a robust demand environment and continued confidence in our ability to scale production headcount, we are raising our business outlook for 2021. So starting with our full year outlook, revenue growth will now be at least 40% on a reported basis, and in constant currency terms will now be at least 38% after factoring in an approximate 2% favorable foreign exchange impact. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue growth will be at least 34%. After excluding an approximate 400 basis points of revenue contribution from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months, including Emakina. This compares to the previous full year revenue growth outlook of 37% reported, 35% in constant currency and 32% in organic constant currency terms, which we provided during our Q2 earnings call. We expect GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 17% to 18%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to continue to be approximately 11% which includes the benefit of certain tax credits I mentioned previously. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation will now be 22%. For earnings per share, we expect the GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.86 to $7.93 for the full year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $8.72 to $8.79 for the full year. We expect weighted average share count of $59.1 million in fully diluted shares outstanding. For Q4 of 2021, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.075 billion to $1.085 billion, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 49% at the midpoint of the range, with the favorable impact of foreign exchange on revenue growth expected to be minimal. Lastly, we expect approximately 800 basis points of revenue contribution to come from acquisitions closed over the last 12 months, including Emakina. For the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be the range of 13.5% to 14.5%, and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 17% to 18%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 14%. And our non-GAAP effective tax rate which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation to be approximately 22%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.11 to $2.18 for the quarter, and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.44 to $2.51 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59.3 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurement in the fourth quarter. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $31.4 million. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $5.6 million. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately $1.5 million loss. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $8 million. And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $13 million in the quarter. In summary, we are pleased whether Q3 results and the record growth we are producing in our 2021 fiscal year. While it is too early to give a detailed view of our business outlook for 2022, we believe that demand environment continues to support an elevated annual growth rate in excess of our traditional guidance greater than 20%. However, we also believe that it is important to establish and maintain a more sustainable growth rate in the coming year than that achieved in 2021. As we have done in the past, we will provide our detailed view of 2022 guidance in February on our Q4 earnings call. Operator, let’s open the call up for questions.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open.
Bryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask about the spread between your headcount growth versus revenue growth. It's really widened here, despite the utilization normalizing. Can you talk about some of the key drivers there as well as sustainable level for that difference?
Jason Peterson: Yes, I think that we continue to see some improvement in pricing, as I think we've discussed over the last couple of calls. And then probably there's a little bit of shift from a geographic standpoint in different geographies, to have somewhat the higher rate rates associated with them. And so I think you might continue to see some improvement over time. And as I think we've sort of talked about, we feel like we've definitely increased our capacity to add headcount and more specifically to retain headcount. And so we expect that we, we will continue to add headcount at greater than historic rates. But currently we're guiding to a somewhat lower increase in headcount in Q4 relative to Q3, based on what we think will be a little bit of slowdown in people joining the company in the month of December.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. And then just on the growth outlook, so really looks quite broad based across the business. Just any thoughts on how 2022 growth may progress considering the level of comps you continue to put on board here in 21? And, more specifically, how do you feel about headroom to grow in some of your largest clients?
Jason Peterson: The demand environment continues to be strong. We see quite a bit of growth from existing clients. We also have a number of engagements that we have entered into more recently that have a lot of growth potential. So that demand environment is obviously quite solid. We also feel that we have increased our ability to support organic growth rates. At the same time, I should say that we don't expect that 36% organic growth rate become a normal sort of multiyear sustainable norm.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. And the largest accounts, headroom and those, do you still feel strong there?
Jason Peterson: Yes, there's definitely there's, there's there's potential in the larger accounts.
Bryan Bergin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Jamie Friedman: Hi, let me echo the congratulations. Two questions, I was I guess I'll ask him, maybe for Ark. In your prepared remarks Ark you asked -- I mean, you were just discussing experienced consultants, and you use that word experience. I was just wondering, how are you doing? What verticals especially are you drawing talent from with the experience consultants? And then the second thing is Jason, is there any call out about Q4 seasonality or ideally 2022 budgets? Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So the equation I'm sorry, the question about where we take in people where we kind of bring in people from or in what markets we are applying the paper? Because I especially…
Jamie Friedman: Especially the second one Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. Oh, I simply, I don't think there is in here much difference with us and with other companies playing in the market right now. This is pretty much corrosion. Most of the articles clear. I think consumer goods travel retail, definitely leading this what it would be relevant for my journey to financial services on definitely entertainment. And publishing, so I think it's pretty much corrosion all and healthcare and life science. All of it.
Jason Peterson: Yes, I guess I'll answer the second question. So good morning. And from the standpoint of budgets, budgets intact as we sort of execute for clients are looking to invest and continue to, drive digital transformation. So right now it continues to be a market where probably supply constraint is the greater issue rather than demand. And we enter 2022, which looks with what looks like a pretty intact demand environment.
Jamie Friedman: Got it. I'll drop back in the queue. Thank you.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ramsey LFO with Barclays. Your line is open. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter. I guess the question and in the past, you guys have spoken about sort of the risk to corporate culture from growing too fast and the ability to grow too fast. So as you scale has that ability changed? Or has your view changed?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Alright, so I think Ashwin I think it’s definitely a very relevant concern. And we are paying a lot of attention to this. At the same time, like things changing from the point of view how we were thinking about general decoration, level of distribution, how people work in just two years ago, so I'm just reminded exactly about kind of our late 80s [ph] sometimes, and we've put during the last couple years and even starting to do before a lot of efforts to make sure that we create an environment from digital ecosystem perspective as well, to see how we can support the culture better in, in what we were thinking will be relevant, probably not during the 2020 2021 but later. It's all accelerated like we always talking about it. But at the same time, that's exactly what Jason already mentioned. We don't believe that it's sustainable to grow as the growth reaches, which is happening right now for a relatively long period of time. So I think it might be better than what we were expecting a couple years ago, when we were talking about our growth 20 plus percent organic growth, maybe it will be better in the future. But it's definitely the rate which we brought in today, because in this case, we will be kind of 50%, 60%, 70% of people who will be new to the company, which is very difficult to sustain culture and quality of the delivery. And we were very, very much focusing on the quality levels.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Understood, understood, no. So you focused on the right things as far as that that type of growth is concerned, which is, which is good. I guess, one separate question that goes with Emakina, which I guess that process has been on-going since August. Just to clarify is the acquisition now complete in terms of just the for public share repurchase and stuff like that? And is this an area where you would see yourself continuing to scale in terms of acquiring a lot of local talent in many different geographies?
Jason Peterson: Yes, so from I guess, the acquisition standpoint, over 98% of shareholders have agreed to tender their shares and cash has been transferred, we're still going through a little bit of a, I guess, what's called a squeeze out process here for the remainder of the shareholders. And so, for all practical purposes, we would control the company, as of I guess, yesterday. And I guess that's kind of what I'd say about that.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And we definitely focusing on expanding in, in the market, and in making acquisition bring in, like 1100 people to us, specifically in European markets. It's definitely improving our experience consultancy, digital consultancy, marketing, related consultancy skills, which is a little bit new to EPAM but very complementary to what we're doing. But it's also very reasonable improvement of our presence across European and in some Middle East organisation. And we are planning to continuously doing this, but again, with right proportion, and with consistent focus on delivery and engineering, and engineering and quality.
Jason Peterson: And just to clarify, and I think I said that in my prepared remarks, but we've got two months of Emakina results built into the guidance that we communicated for the Q4 quarter.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Understood. Okay. Great, thank you.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Your line is open.
Maggie Nolan: Thank you. I'm wondering what is the level of seniority of the employees that you've been hiring so rapidly in the last couple of quarters here and has the pyramid of makeup shifted in the last couple of years?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we are definitely doing very specific analysis on this part. And while we are growing faster than we expected, we keep inching new at parameter infact right now. So this is kind of short term. We're clearly there's a singularity we bring in more new people. And that's a little bit more challenging. That's kind of related to the previous question is, Ashwin was asking, we are carefully doing this. But again, seniority parameter is supported, as needed for the type of services we deliver.
Maggie Nolan: Thank you. And then in previous quarters, you've discussed putting through an additional number of price increases compared to prior years. How widespread is this across your client base? And what is the magnitude and how receptive has clients been to these conversations?
Jason Peterson: Yes, we continue to have discussions and negotiations with clients around rate increases, some of those are coming in the second half of 2021. At the same time, we're also beginning to have the discussions around rate increases for the beginning of 2022, which is kind of the more traditional period for rate increases. Obviously nobody's likes to absorb a rate increase but I think based on everything that people are seeing from a wage inflation standpoint, from, I guess, a global inflation standpoint, and just the continued strong demand for resources. These are relatively easier conversations than we've had in the past. And I expect that we will see better price increase or rate increase in 2022, than we've seen in previous years.
Maggie Nolan: Is that pretty widespread across their client base Jason?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So, every client is probably a little bit different. But yes, I think that, there's a, there will generally be greater increases across clients that we've seen in the past. Some clients will have higher rate increases than others depending on where they've kind of been historically. We are trying to make certain that we are growing our business responsibly, and sort of able to maintain sort of as a stable sort of level of profitability the way we've run the business over the last couple years.
Maggie Nolan: Thank you. Congratulations.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys, this is Kathy on for Jason, great set of results here. I wanted to ask about margins. I mean, obviously, your margin performance has been very impressive year-to-date. I think you're already tracking to the upper end of your full year guidance range of 17% to 18%. Just curious, is there a reason you didn't take up the full year margin guidance? Is it just conservatism? Or are there other factors that we should be aware of thing?
Jason Peterson: Sure. So we believe that the 17% to 18% guidance that we maintained for adjusted income from operations is the appropriate kind of guidance. Q3 was a quite strong quarter, which did some of the profitability improvement was a result of the sort of the upside and revenue that was somewhat unexpected in the quarter. For Q4, we expect that SG&A will come up a little bit between Q3 and Q4 will maintain gross margins kind of in and around the range that we saw in Q3. And then I think the other thing I should point out is that, our recent acquisitions have somewhat lower levels of profit than our traditional EPAM business. So all of those things kind of pushes you more towards a Q4 exit in the middle of that 17% to 18% range. And so that's that's kind of what forms that 17% to 18% guidance for the full year.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, very helpful. And just a quick follow up. Just wanted to ask about utilization. Obviously, the Q3 number was mostly came in about two years now. So is that just due to timing of on-boarding, this obviously had a very sharp hiring quarter or, obviously, demand remains very strong. So just wanted to know is there any factors contributing to that thing?
Jason Peterson: So utilization in Q3 is traditionally the seasonal low quarter. And so if you think about a world, I guess, pre 2020, it's a time when people go on vacation. And if you're lucky enough to be in Europe, maybe it's a two or three week vacation. And so utilization is relatively low. Last year, when people couldn't leave their homes and countries, we saw higher utilization than is typical. The 77.1% that we saw in Q3 is actually pretty good. And sort of again, sort of seasonally consistent. We expect utilization might come up a little bit in Q4 but not unhappy with the 77.1% that we had in Q3. And I guess the other thing I should point out is no, we usually think about the businesses kind of running in maybe a 77% to 79% utilization. And again, it is somewhat seasonal. There are quarters when we run, at or above 80%. But we generally consider that on the hotter side.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, very helpful. Thanks, guys.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Surinder Thind: Hi, Jason. Just I was hoping for a bit more color on your commentary around when you mentioned looking towards a more sustainable growth rate, what you currently generated. Is that commentary around the scale which EPAM is currently operating at or is that also some commentary on the industry growth that's occurring and maybe ultimately some expectations of slowdown as we as we look ahead?
Jason Peterson: I think it's difficult to comment about the industry as a whole. At this point, we think there is a very strong demand and there is no really sciences is the way to go go down. At the same time from our internal assessment we really would like to make sure that we bring in -- to the clients, and supporting the reputation we should build during previous couple of decades. And from this point of view, we're talking about sustainability of our growth. Because like, if you're going to grow in like 50%, for a couple years, it's, it's our size. We don't believe that it's possible to do in the complexity of the business, we're referring to the complexity of the engagements or so basically, sustainability was referring exactly to, to our understanding what's possible, in reality, with keeping the quality and culture of the company now, similar reply to what we already did to them as well.
Surinder Thind: Understood. And then related to the commentary around expectations of strong and demand outlook. As you look over the next X number of years, you made a comment earlier about the negativity of predicting demand about a year ago, and where you thought things were, can you maybe provide some color around what gives you confidence that the current level of demand from an industry perspective is sustainable at these levels? And then if we look at past cycles, it seems like demand, where it's spiked will persist for a couple of years. But then there's generally a quick draw down, any color you can provide their and your conflicts obviously?
Jason Peterson: I think our point was exactly how difficult to predict the future and how just couple of years ago, we didn't understand that it would be the turnover, which happened. And even 12 months ago, we saw the impact of pandemic will be different than then just one or two quarters later is changed. And that's why from your question, we do believe that it would be strong demand during the next several years, what would be after this and how this wave will be working? And it's interesting question because everything changes. So unfortunately, I cannot give you the uses kind of assurance for the next decade or so.
Surinder Thind: Understood, that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
James Faucette: Thank you very much. And thanks for all the detail today. I'm wondering, you mentioned in prepared remarks that you're making some progress on standing up new delivery centers, in different regions. Can you give a little more detail on that? How is hiring going in those regions? And how are you being able to build and, and the EPAM brand which seems to serve to really well to date in your existing geographies?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think you will be very consistent with our comment to the sides. I don't remember in what quarter we were saying that it's easy to breed talent. And I'm pretty sure all of us were confirming that it's also very global. There is no practically spaces in the world today where you can come and start into hire like talent without, without challenges. And I think each quarter is demand is becoming more challenging. At the same time, our investments in education and our recruitment processes, and automation and everything becoming more impactful and allowed us to support what we're doing today. I don't know what else to say. I think war for talent is like in all media, no websites everywhere, like everybody talking about it. And we're pretty proud to this point to be able to sustain the level of net additions which you have in level of kind of relatively manageable attrition rates.
James Faucette: And certainly have good reason to be proud and impressed with what you've done to date on a hiring. You also talked about I just want to talk a little bit of brass quickly on customer growth and contribution. It seemed like there was pretty material sequential growth across your top customers. But how much is that the result of have their own demand versus you turning away, maybe other business and, and so that's resulting in more concentration? And how should we think about that going forward? Do you think we can get far enough ahead of the hiring curve to be able to take on some of that work that maybe you've been turning away recently? Or is that going to be an on-going challenge?
Jason Peterson: Yes, so I think that we're actually kind of de-concentrating. What I would say is that, if you looked at that cohort, in the 11, to 20, you did have pretty elevated growth rates in that cohort. And maybe some of that speaks to sort of the trends we're seeing in the market. So you've got a few clients, one in the asset management space, that was probably somewhat unprepared for that the new digital kind of operating world, the pandemic, sort of encouraged them to make investments, and now there's a significant amount of investment around updating their infrastructure and the way they connect with their end clients. And so you've got, I would say, a number of companies who probably got additional religion, the via the pandemic, and you are seeing quite accelerated investment. And then EPAM continues to bring that sort of trusted partner to the table. And so, clients who are looking to make certain that their transformation journey is successful, oftentimes are working with EPAM, because of the track record that Arkadiy have spoken about. So we did see some really strong growth in the 11 through 20. But we're also seeing very strong growth in the customers below 20. I would say, probably, if you're an existing customer with strong demand, you probably have a little bit more of a say at the table. And so probably they are getting a little bit more their share of resources in brand new customers. And again, we continue to be constrained by supply and are expecting that, we'll continue to have very, very solid net additions in Q4, but at a somewhat lower level than in Q3, okay. And of course, that excludes the 1100 additions coming through in Emakina. So I said a lot. Was that relatively clear or?
James Faucette: Yes, that was that was perfect. Just the one clarification that and I think you touched on this in terms of the lower net addition in the fourth quarter. Do you think that is that seasonal or is there some other aspects that are impacting that?
Jason Peterson: I mean, I think generally, what we're thinking is that December is a time when most people don't change jobs. And so we'll have maybe fewer joiners in December. But it might be a reflection that things could get a little bit harder over time. But, as Ark just talked about, we've really improved our capability to attract. I think our hiring brand continues to improve quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year. We've also improved our ability to staff projects and to match supply and demand. So I think that we've improved our capabilities around organic growth rates. But, again, are expecting a somewhat slower level of net additions in Q4.
James Faucette: That's great, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Arvind Ramnani with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Arvind Ramnani: Hey, congrats on a terrific quarter. I just want to go back to a comment Ark made in the prepared remarks in talking about kind of pushing into new areas and capabilities. So, a couple of questions around this, what are you doing in terms of figuring out which areas to invest in, just given the breadth of tech innovation kind of across the space, which areas -- how are you deciding which areas to really kind of focus on and, and build capabilities in before there's commercial, or revenue opportunity? And the second question is, how are you deciding what areas to, to kind of de-emphasize, are they are there certain areas where you're, you don't see much growth? How are you deciding what areas to say, like, we're going to focus less on these areas?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, like, I appreciate your questions, like, all the stress, trying to understand the future and how are we doing this? And so like, what simple solid question which like, really complex. I just would like to remind like, I'm not going to go to specific topics, but we do believe that one of the advantages which we feel that around, probably 30% or 40% of our business is still working with software companies and technology companies and platform companies. And we're doing significant kinds of sometimes significant portion of the development of new products and platform for this type of clients, which is giving us like very different exposure to what's happening in different areas, like sometimes we do a new product, or new concept like wide shoulders and is going to the market, but then we are forced to help this type of clients to do implementation of this. So we have kind of organic internal barometer if you will, to help us to select some areas, and we build this capability sometimes in very organic. [Technical difficulty] quick, and as we designed, we trying to keep this proportion of this of such clients in our in our business portfolio to be able to continuously do business. This is from technology standpoint. And then from end to end solutions don't quit. We definitely is everything what we were sharing about consultancy. We're going up and up in the chain and expand in our business perspective of what we building and how we can help clients. And first consulting was for us [Indiscernible] technologies, and we added experience components. And we were talking about business now, talking about strategy in my keynote part of this but we also did couple more positions in this area. And this is when we're talking about new areas. It's not only about new technologies, it's also was the whole end to end story.
Arvind Ramnani: Perfect, perfect. Another question, certainly in the last few years, we have expanded our consulting capabilities, which makes a lot more sense. Given that now you're doing close to a billion dollars in revenue per quarter. Can you just talk maybe about the competitive set who are you winning business from? Are you is -- a competitive set changed now versus three, four years back?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think you understand our competitive base very, very well. And I think we just get in proportionally more to the situation when consultant becomes much, much more important part to start the business to open the door. From this point of view, I think we see the difference from general competitive on kind of what exactly companies we compete against. I think it's largely the same because most of the large vendors had these capabilities before. We’re just trying to bring different values through integrating better with delivery and generic.
Arvind Ramnani: Perfect, thank you, and good luck for rest of the year.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Enders with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Steve Enders: Okay, great. Thanks for thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the macron kind of where budgets are at this point. Good to see, I guess travel and consumer specifically, recovery here. But are you still seeing some of that depressed funding levels from COVID? So I've been across some of the verticals in your client base.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don't believe we see any of this exists at this stage. I’ve seen practically and it's not only about rolling consumers, it’s practically about all indices. We do believe that everybody understand that preparation for something new or even like changes which this pandemic trigger splitting constant. And when I was saying before, like it's difficult to predict what would be two years or three years from now, it is difficult and anything can happen and we all understand it. But mostly I was referring to level of demand which is happening specifically right now. The level which was seeing and prediction for longer term like before pandemic I think is definitely will be there for longer term as well. So but direct answer to your equation, no we don't see any type of sign of partial depression still from the pandemic right now as a market, in our market.
Steve Enders: Okay perfect. I guess as a follow up, just as you kind of think about the biggest challenges that you are now trying to solve for today is still the biggest thing, the ability to bring in more talent. And we're just going to kind of gross margin were that that today is the disability to bring in talent and pass on some of the some of the costs there and deal with the higher hiring levels or kind of what's the biggest challenge here you're still solving for today?
Arkadiy Dobkin: In a very simplistic way here the biggest challenge is a brilliant talent. But I think it's a overall huge oversimplification of what's happening. Because talent is a very broad term, like in general, you can it's possible to hire a lot of people. The point is, what type of people, how to orchestrate the complex complexity of the end game, how to connect with the clients in the right way. I think orchestration of the kind of integrated teams working together, specifically when you growing like 30 plus percent when you have a lot of new people, and you need to kind of bring them up to what's happening and understand the type of engagement which we do in the scale, which is happening right now. That's the real challenge. So the net acquisition, important enabler of this value should be there, but the real concern how we deliver it, and that's should be some kind of very well understood.
Jason Peterson: And I'm going to step in and kind of respond to that sort of more tactical question on gross margin. So we talked about earlier in this call that we do continue to see elevated wage inflation. We are getting somewhat better increases in rates, okay, but probably not fully able to offset wage inflation, wherever the one important point is, this year, we've had our performances, I think you've seen as we've taken apart guidance, I think every quarter. And so we have a variable compensation element that is the expense is based on the strength of the company's performance and revenue growth and profitability. So we're, you're booking the expense associate with variable compensation at a much, much higher level this year than we have in past years. So next year, you think that that, I would think that would normalize. And so that will have a positive impact on gross margin. And then you may continue to have some pressure with wage inflation and, hopefully those two kind of offset each other. And just to sort of round it out, the variable compensation expense shows up throughout the year and that is generally paid in the form of a variable payout to employees in at the end of Q1 quarter and the beginning of the Q2 quarter.
Steve Enders: Perfect. Thanks for taking the question, very helpful.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Vladimir Bespalov with VTB Capital. Your line is open.
Vladimir Bespalov: Hello, congratulations on very good number. And thank you for taking my question. I would like to ask you about your M&A pipeline and -- of the M&A market since Ark mentioned that this is a part of your strategy going forward and important part. So do you feel like the competition on this market is growing? Because there have been a lot of activity in the sector in general? Do you feel like the that it's getting more and more difficult to find the proper targets the valuations are going up and things like this, so could you provide some color? Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it's definitely known fact as the answer will be yes, yes, and yes and so basically there are a lot of companies on the market, but competition is growing and price is growing as well. So that's very natural in the markets situation which you described. And we still go into to find the right companies to, to bring on board and to improve our capabilities. So we like everybody else to a number opportunities right now.
Vladimir Bespalov: Okay. Thank you very much.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, absolutely. Thank you.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Arkadiy Dobkin for closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: As always, thank you very much for attending the call today. You know that if you have any equations days, data is available and again, see you in three months. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-05 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the EPAM Systems Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
David Straube: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company’s second quarter 2021 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me today are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today’s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described in the company’s earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website. With that said, I’ll now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We delivered a strong set of results for the second quarter with revenues of $881 million, reflecting reported year-over-year growth rate of 39% and 36% in constant currency terms. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.05, an increase of 40% over the same quarter in 2020. Growth was very much broad based. All our geographies and most of our industry verticals experienced strong demand, reflecting the robust market environment and pushing our growth rate to historically [indiscernible] levels. On a sequential basis, quarterly revenues exceeded our Q1 results by more than $100 million, and we finished another quarter with very strong sequential growth. The reason for surge in demand is pretty obvious. By now we all know that application development and cloud and data integration services are growing postpandemic very strongly and driving corporate budgets forward. But in addition, it has become very visible that the current client transformation efforts are continuous and multidimensional and carries uncertainty of them now. And that is the reason why, on top of application development and cloud integration at large, we are seeing very fast expanding demand for software-enabled business scenarios coming our way, too. Overall and across all our industry verticals we have a portfolio of both new and current customers. We see progression into new and larger multiyear engagements as our customers look in part to fulfill both engineering demand as well as demand for new collaboration models that bring in greater stake in product design and product management. In short, clients really need simultaneous help with both strategy and implementations today. This means that we will have to smartly blend not only industry and functional consulting expertise, but a good portion of management consulting capabilities together with very scalable and tough notions we need in technology delivery services, which have been maturing over the years. All that requires us to experiment with new approaches to source different type of talent, manage numerous risk and find very new ways of work in general. And we’re doing all of that. First, certain operation practices introduced in response to COVID that made us nimble and responding to new customer demands. And we have created an even more adaptable internal digital platforms to manage our increasingly global business operation. Additionally, throughout 2021, we have focused on establishing repeatable approaches to drive growth across a more globally diversified delivery base while also expanding our domain capability and geographical footprint both organically and through acquisitions. Finally, we are constantly incenting our partner ecosystem with closer and more vertically aligned [working] that position EPAM as a partner of choice for our cloud, digital and industry solution innovations. That includes, for example, EPAM active participation in the MACH Alliance and continuous contribution of over 4,500 EPAMers to open-source projects, which makes EPAM the #1 services company in the open-source community and among top 20 global contributors overall. Let’s bring now some highlights on expanding our EPAM Continuum [motion], which remains one of our core priorities, including the addition of strategy advisory services on top of already established industry and functional consulting capabilities. It’s becoming important exactly because of growing client demand for software-enabled business scenarios. And we seek now to help clients across a number of areas in their fast-changing businesses with both strategy implementations simultaneously. During the last several calls, we were sharing specific client stories to illustrate our progress in the end-to-end solution and increasing impact of our consulting [quoting] to our overall engagement. We brought examples from the gaming industry, which was one of the few that performed well even at the beginning of the pandemic uncertainty; and the health care industry, where we are helping with large-scale technology platform transformation efforts; and data and analytics segment, where we assisted to one of the most sophisticated global information providers with a massive cloud modernization story. Today, we would like to highlight a client from the retail industry where we have delivered across the range of end-to-end programs. This American multinational manufacturer and marketer of prestigious skincare, makeup, fragrance and haircare products is undergoing their own transformation to drive a deeper connection to their customers, optimize operations and shorten their supply chain. It’s in part responding to consumer changes because of the global pandemic with a wider shift in the luxury and retail business model. We are working with the company to develop a control tower equivalent of their supply chain, connecting several internal and external data points, including product performance across geographic regions, competitor analysis, consumer engagement index, social media and even weather events to create a predictive view and form a real-time production and placement of their projects in consumer markets. This supply chain optimization project leveraging our business consulting, data analytics and engineering capabilities. With a blending of physical and digital consumer buying behaviors, we developed a virtual trial platform, allowing the consumer to apply a cosmetic using AR/VR technology, in addition to creating a virtual consultation and the ability to engage with their consumer in new ways. The platform can be repurposed across their multiple cosmetic brands. The digital engagement platform strengthened the user journey during the pandemic months when stores were closed across the world and had driven better conversion rates and results for consumer acquisitions online. It’s already obvious that major consumer behavior shifts happened and are here to stay, so the company and EPAM believe that their future sales will be largely driven by digital platforms and the increased functionality based on the latest technology trends. Let’s move now to the topic of talent. While the supply of talent continues to be the major challenge that is faced by all of the players in our sector, EPAM continues to grow rapidly in Central and Eastern Europe and in India. Additionally, we opened a new delivery location in Ontario, Canada and are also expanding our operations in Latin America with the acquisition in Colombia of a digital and engineering company, which we just have closed a couple of days ago. We’ll share more details just in couple of minutes. In total, in Q2, we welcomed more than 3,800 net hires organically to EPAM, this talent joining the company from our university programs, lateral hires in our delivery locations and, increasingly, senior-level hires in our -- in market geographies with extensive industry experience. The last one allow us to expand our EPAM Continuum penetration of North American market with the addition of business experience and technology consulting teams in 1/2 dozen new locations. While in Europe, we also brought new consulting capability via acquisition. In total, in the first half of 2021, approximately 6,700 net additions have joined EPAM, a number greater than what we historically ever had added on a full year basis. As in the past, to maintain hiring at an accelerated rate, we continue to make significant investments in our global talent development, upskilling and educational programs. We believe that in addition to these investments, our internal platform progression in talent, analysis and AI will continue to bring us a new level of engagement and capability to deploy increasingly higher-value services to our global enterprise customers. We also believe that while all this should allow us to continuously scale, it will also ensure the quality standards of our delivery services without compromising costs. Last time, we shared news about 3 companies being added to EPAM via our M&A efforts. Recently, we made 2 more acquisitions to extend our consulting and engineering capabilities while also expanding our presence in several of our key geographies. Last week, we announced our acquisition of CORE SE, consultancy think tank specializing in IT strategy and technology-driven transformations with presence in Berlin, Dubai, London and Zurich. CORE will strengthen EPAM’s strategy consulting footprint and extend our talent footprint in the DACH region. Earlier this week, we also closed the acquisition of S4N, a digital software engineering company. In addition to their primary application platform development expertise, the company specializes in machine learning, data architecture and cloud ops. Located in Bogota, Colombia and with presence in Seattle, Washington, the acquisition of S4N expands EPAM’s geographic presence in Latin America and forms a second, for us, [indiscernible]. We are extremely pleased to extend EPAM’s new talent and capabilities offered by those 2 firms. Regarding acquisitions, I would like to close with some additional comments related to our recent efforts in the area. We already see visible contribution from our recent M&A activities in such areas as cyber advanced analytics, specifically on PolSource, which is one of the largest deals to date. We should say that we are rapidly shaping new EPAM offering and accelerating our go-to-market activities within the fast-growing sales force [indiscernible]. With that, let me hand the call over to Jason, who will provide more specifics on our Q2 results and update our 2021 business outlook.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our Q2 results, which reflect strong growth across a broad range of industry verticals and geographies. In the second quarter, EPAM delivered revenues of $881.4 million, a year-over-year increase of 39.4% on a reported basis and 35.9% in constant currency terms, reflecting a positive foreign exchange impact of 350 basis points. This quarter’s revenue growth was substantially driven by the continued improvement in the company’s ability to expand delivery capacity in response to the extremely strong demand for EPAM’s services. Moving on to industry vertical performance. We delivered very strong sequential and year-over-year growth across the travel and consumer, financial services, telecommunications, energy and manufacturing and automotive industries. Looking at the year-over-year performance across each of our industry verticals, travel and consumer grew 59.9% driven by very strong growth from both our consumer and retail clients, who are initiating and expanding large-scale transformation programs as they look for different ways to connect to their end customers. Financial services grew 51.5% with very strong, broad-based growth coming from banking, insurance wealth management and payment platform providers. Like last quarter, growth was driven by modernization and transformation of core applications, in addition to new payment platforms associated with real-time payments. Software and hi-tech grew 33.2% in the quarter. Life sciences and health care grew 33.1%. Business information & media delivered 12.5% growth in the quarter. Growth in the quarter reflected a tougher comparison with the same quarter last year, with several clients having experienced substantial growth in the first half of 2020 with revenues from those programs generally plateauing late in 2020. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered 56.4% growth driven by clients in telecommunications, energy, manufacturing and automotive. From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region representing 59.8% of our Q2 revenues, grew 38.1% year-over-year or 36.9% in constant currency. Europe, representing 33% of our Q2 revenues, grew 38% year-over-year or 29.9% in constant currency. CIS, representing 4.4% of our Q2 revenues, grew 70.8% year-over-year and 74.6% in constant currency. Strong performance in both financial services and materials, in addition to travel & consumer contributing to growth in Q2. And finally, APAC grew 44.4% year-over-year or 38.9% in constant currency terms and now represents 2.8% of our revenues. In Q2, revenue growth across the portfolio resulted in increased customer diversification with our top 20 clients growing 19% while our clients outside our top 20 grew 55%. And moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 33.8% compared to 33.7% in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35% compared to 35.1% in the same quarter last year. Gross margin for the first half of 2021 reflects some degree of elevated labor costs in certain locations, which we expect to manage with rate increases and staffing rotation. GAAP SG&A was 17.2% of revenue compared to 18.1% in Q2 of last year. And non-GAAP SG&A came in at 15.6% of revenue compared to 16% in the same period last year. While the absolute dollar spend of our SG&A has increased, the relative percentage of revenue remains lower than historical averages. GAAP income from operations was $125.3 million or 14.2% of revenue in the quarter compared to $83.4 million or 13.2% of revenue in Q2 last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $155.2 million or 17.6% of revenues in the quarter compared to $108.2 million or 17.1% of revenue in Q2 last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 6.9%, which includes a higher-than-expected level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits, was 22.9%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.94. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.05, reflecting a 40.4% increase over the same quarter in 2020. In Q2, there were approximately 59 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q2 was $68.8 million compared to $146.2 million in the same quarter of 2020. Free cash flow was $46.2 million compared to $134.7 million in the same quarter last year. The lower level of free cash flow in Q2 2021 relative to Q2 2020 was the result of changes in DSO in each quarter, higher levels of cash payments made in Q2 2021 associated with corporate income tax and the absence of tax payment deferral programs made available in Q2 2020 as part of government COVID-related programs. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. At the end of Q2, DSO was 70 days and compares to 67 days in Q1 2021 and 73 days in the same quarter last year. We expect to maintain DSO around the same level for the remainder of the year. Moving on to the operational metrics. We ended the quarter with more than 42,800 consultants, designers and engineers, a year-over-year increase of 32.6%. Our total headcount for Q2 was more than 47,850 employees. Both groups of employees grew just over 10% sequentially. Utilization was 80.2% compared to 83.9% in Q2 of last year and 81.4% in Q1 2021. Now let’s turn to guidance. With a strong first half behind us, a robust demand environment and increased confidence in our ability to scale production headcount in order to meet this demand, we are raising our business outlook for 2021. Starting with our full year outlook. Revenue growth will now be at least 37% on a reported basis and in constant currency terms will now be at least 35% after factoring in approximate 2% favorable foreign exchange impact. We now expect approximately 300 basis points of revenue contribution coming from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months, including CORE SE and S4N. We expect GAAP income from operations will now be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%. And non-GAAP income from operations will now be in the range of 17% to 18% based on the strength of our first half and anticipated ongoing efficiencies in SG&A spending as a percentage of revenue. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate will now be approximately 11% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to continue to be approximately 23%. Earnings per share. We expect that GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.70 to $7.89 for the full year. And non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $8.25 to $8.44 for the full year. We expect weighted average share count of 59 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For Q3 of 2021, we expect revenues to be in the range of $957 million to $965 million, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 47% at the midpoint of the range. We expect the favorable impact of FX on revenue growth to be approximately 1%. Lastly, we now expect approximately 450 basis points of revenue contribution to come from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months. For the third quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%, and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 17% to 18%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 13% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to be approximately 23%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.89 to $1.96 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.22 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59.2 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $27.6 million in Q3 and $25.7 million in Q4. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $5.6 million for each of the remaining quarters. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $1.5 million loss for each of the remaining quarters. Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $7.6 million in Q3 and approximately $7.1 million in Q4. And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $13.7 million in Q3 and $12.8 million in Q4. In summary, we are pleased with our Q2 and first half 2021 results, which, combined with the broad-based strength we see across the business, provides support for what we believe will be a very strong 2021 performance. Operator, let’s open the call up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Grossman with Stifel.
David Grossman: It’s obviously a very strong quarter and a very strong outlook. And it sounds like, to some extent, it was volume driven and your ability to access labor pools that you, I guess, earlier in the year envisioned being more difficult. So maybe you can help us better understand, what changed over the course of the last 3 months that enabled you to access that labor? Were you doing something different? Did something break in the market? Maybe just some more insight into kind of what evolved over the last 3 or 4 months.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it was happening across multiple efforts, which we started not necessarily even 3 months ago but even before COVID, how were looking at our delivery ecosystem. And we were talking about diversification, going to different markets and growing in existing location. And I think we were not sure what exactly the results would be, but the last couple of quarters confirmed that most of the efforts were fruitful and we grew in like -- we grew pretty well not only in Eastern Europe anymore but also across India. And we started to much more aggressively work in Latin America as well. But even in some markets in Europe -- in Western Europe and in the U.S., we were hiring more people than we were anticipating before. So I think it’s across multiple components of this.
David Grossman: So was there anything specific, Ark, that you thought among those initiatives that was particularly effective in driving your ability to kind of recruit?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Again, I don’t think there is one magic kind of source which was happening. It’s exactly broad based, again with India becoming another point of growth for us in addition to Eastern Europe before.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So David, probably a broader range of geographies from which we were recruiting. Additionally, probably the ability to sort of bring in staff that are in a more distributed mode gives us access to staff and resources in different geographies, even within the countries that we’ve traditionally recruited. So I think it’s both that and then, just obviously, we’re working hard to meet demand.
David Grossman: Right. And I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the ability to offset some of the gross margin pressure from higher labor costs with pricing. So I think that last year was this unusual year where you had pricing going up, labor markets with -- at the same time, trying to keep pricing down to your clients who were under duress. So did that start to change in the first half of the year? Or is that something that’s more of a prospective thing that’s going to -- going back to a more normalized pricing environment?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So I think one of the things that we’re beginning to see even in the middle of this year, which I think is different than certainly last year and probably different even than prior years, 2019 and ‘18, is we are getting midyear rate increases. So we are working with clients to begin to take up rates even here and as we entered Q3. And then clearly, as I discussed in the last call, is that we’re expecting to see greater-than-usual rate increases in 2022. So there’s a real focus on account margin. There’s even some prioritization of staffing related to both profitability and, obviously, the strategic nature of the client. And so I think that the dynamics on the pricing side are certainly improving. And at the same time, we still have to manage in an elevated wage inflation environment.
David Grossman: Right. And just one last question is I think you mentioned the acquisition contribution for the third quarter and the year. I just want to make sure I got that right. Was it 450 for the year, 450 bps from...
Jason Peterson: Yes. So it’s 450 bps for Q3 and it’s 300 bps for 2021.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.
Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask you about -- you had mentioned that COVID kind of inspired you guys to create more digital platforms with more and more repeatable approaches to delivery. Is this one of the drivers of margin expansion in the business? Is that an overstatement? Or is that part of what’s giving you confidence to raise the full year margin guidance a little bit?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don’t -- we don’t believe that it’s actually margin related kind of benefit. It’s mostly how to manage and how to deliver and how to bring the talent in the company and be able to operate more actively. So employees will probably deliver and -- while we grow and as we’re growing right now. So...
Ramsey El-Assal: Fair enough. Okay. And then could you give us an update on your consulting strategy in terms of -- I don’t know what you can share there in terms of cross-sell. Or -- and also, just comment on the driver of your kind of bullish guidance. To what degree has consulting played a part in accelerating your broader growth in terms of engaging with clients or getting more work on the table? If you could comment on that, it’d be great.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think at large, there is not much change from our previous comment. We’re not trying to build like separate -- completely separate line of business in consultancy. What -- we’re trying to deliver more end-to-end solutions and be able to advise client early in this end-to-end story. And we see in the progress like we definitely must be -- were accumulating more experience and understanding how to bring these multifunctional teams, including consultants and designers and engineers, for more complex opportunities. So -- and I think it’s starting to pay some dividends. And from what we also saw is that we probably need to go even higher in the value chain and bring some strategic advisory services as well. And we were experimenting during the last 12 months with these type of engagements, which were single engagements for us when we were going to this level, and now decided to strategically invest in this area, too. And one of the acquisitions in Europe is exactly in this segment. So I think in short, we’re hoping that we would be able to make more impact and potentially maybe benefit even in the margin situation. But we still have to prove that it’s going to work this way.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Outstanding quarter here. Congratulations. I want to ask about -- Ark first. In your prepared remarks, you alluded to clients coming to you for software-enabled business scenarios a little bit. Does that change your long-held view that you said many times that you’re a services company, you don’t want to go towards becoming more of a software company, channel conflict, all those things? But I do see that the implied revenue per employee in acquisitions like CORE is much higher. Are you perhaps tweaking around the edges the viewpoint around software in any way?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think when we’re talking about software enablement, it’s more related to the previous question about how much consulting and how actually new business models could drive the opportunity for us to build solutions with still significant portion of custom development because most of the solutions require like almost in real time understanding what’s happening and not necessarily relying on the very standard portion of enterprise packages. So our typical implementations or solutions even today would include like 70%, 80% for custom code on top of the -- some standard components. But combination of this exactly should enable new business models, and that’s what we mostly mean. But if we have the right level of consultancies, then we can advise with this final solution would look like and then help to build it and implement it. At the same time, there is an increasing portion of some accelerators and parts of software which we’re developing over the years. And it’s helping us actually to build the solution sometimes not only with third-party components but with our own components. But again, there’s not much change from our more traditional business model with the exception that we would like to start early in the value chain, including some strategy advise.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Understood. Understood. That’s very helpful. And then this might seem like a hard question given how much outlook is being raised in the results. But last year, obviously, you had certain parts of business, certain verticals that were quite seriously impacted. Does the current outlook reflect that all of those have reasonably fully recovered? Or is there still some recovery to come from what would kind of impair or may hurt verticals from last year?
Jason Peterson: I would say our results still reflect the fact that there’s still some impairments in some of the verticals. But our outlook would include expectations for some improvement, particularly possibly in travel and hospitality, where we’re beginning to see sequential growth but not necessarily annual growth. We do think that business information & media will probably continue to deliver revenue growth below our average revenue growth for the remainder of the year. And although we feel that life sciences & healthcare is going to produce sort of a strong market opportunity for the company longer term, we’ve got a few customer programs that are coming to an end in Q3. And so you might see that we’ll have life sciences & healthcare run at a somewhat lower-than-company growth rate. And of course, the company growth rate is quite high. So that doesn’t mean that it’ll be single digits or something, it just means that it’ll be lower than the average. So I don’t know, I’ve said a lot there. Does that answer your question, Ashwin?
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Yes, it does. Yes, that’s helpful.
Jason Peterson: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.
James Faucette: I wanted to ask -- I was struck a little bit by utilization kind of being down around 80%, which sounds like there’s still a bit more capacity for you. How are you thinking about how long you can kind of stay ahead of the curve from that perspective? And how should we think about utilization evolution over the coming quarters?
Jason Peterson: Yes. I mean utilization traditionally for us ran below 80%. And then we have this very, very high utilization due to sort of unique circumstances in Q2 of 2020. That was almost 84%. But that was really kind of unparalleled utilization for us. So now we do think that once you get to 80%, it does -- clearly, it limits your ability to grow when you’ve got new accounts or when you’ve got accounts that you didn’t expect, and we’re looking for new resources. You don’t have as much availability on your bench. And so I think we probably believe that running maybe in the high 70s, somewhat below 80% is probably a better place for us to be. We also think that we’re going to see somewhat elevated levels of vacation in the second half of 2021. So right now, what we would model is utilization below 80% in the second half of 2021.
James Faucette: Okay. That’s good to hear. And then as far as -- Ark made comments around setting up new delivery centers and hiring in those regions. I’m just wondering how the EPAM brand itself is -- that’s been an important hiring tool for you in the past and how it’s resonating in these new areas locally. And are you being able to adapt and adjust it as needed based on what you’re seeing in hiring trends and retention trends?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think recognition of how different we are in the market created like additional level of curiosity for those that we’ve hired, and they’re definitely trying to understand if they would be -- if they would have good opportunity to grow inside of EPAM. We definitely have very different interest from this more experienced portion of the talent pool globally than we had a couple of years ago. It’s very, very reasonable. At the same time also, our brand recognition in the markets where we operate for some time or new markets which we enter in both in Eastern Europe, because we do have this high level of distribution across this more traditional DACH region, but also in India and Latin America visibly illustrate that there is very different recognition and hope for opportunity inside of -- in many minds, different type of services, companies with very strong engineering heritage, which make some additional attractiveness for the talent. We...
Operator: Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen.
Bryan Bergin: Curious if you can comment on the pace at which you’re able to add new resources to your engagements after they’re hired. So the time to ramp new hires and laterals, has that been accelerated versus the historical pace given just this level of demand? How are you thinking about that? And what kind of levers could you use to drive that better productivity and hiring pace?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So it’s -- in general, we all understand, and it’s not only related to EPAM, there is very different demand trends than we were experiencing not just 12 months ago, because 12 months ago it definitely was a very different story and very different outlook, but let’s say 24 months ago. So everybody knows again, that, pandemic changed the whole direction. In this case, clients -- and many of them work in different kind of agility pressure and ready to work and speed up the whole process. But it’s also a very big effort and kind of harmonization effort to the whole supply chain when you’re growing like we’re growing today. And that’s why exactly we said we invest more in digital ecosystem than I think we experienced, plus we hope we experience some advantages of doing this investment kind of very purposely during the last decade. It’s not just last year or previous year. So -- and we’re benefiting on putting on top of our previous investments. And the whole timing from opening opportunity to start to actually going through staffing process definitely is much more optimal today than it was a couple of years ago for us.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. And then you talked about a progression into new and larger, multiyear engagements. Can you put any numbers around that as far as giving us a sense on how much larger or longer you’re seeing in deals relative to 1 or 2 years ago?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think it’s, in general, difficult to quantify. But like with our growth right now and if you look at the number of clients with $100 million and $50 million and $20 million, that’s number is like very obviously increasing very fast right now. So -- but I don’t think I can give -- or we can give at this point like very special quantified kind of points. And like the only things I would like is that we have now clients which are growing from start to $20 million, $30 million, $50 million. The whole -- this acceleration, also very, very visible.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.
Jason Kupferberg: Congrats. Great numbers. I wanted to start with a follow-up on Bryan’s question, just these larger, multiyear engagements. Is it both the MSAs and individual SOWs that are getting bigger and longer? And I’m just wondering if that’s having any effect on your sales approach and strategy as you pursue larger engagements.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don’t think it’s related to specific MSA sizes because from this point of view, we’re probably in the same situation like before. Nobody promising like huge, huge deals like contractually and up front. The reality of the deals is pretty different. And again, in services business, most of the clients still maintain the flexibility to stop doing things legally, contractually. While in practicality, these engagements are very different right now.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. So given how much your growth is accelerating, have you seen any change in the composition of your top 5, top 10, top 20 clients?
Jason Peterson: So probably not a lot of change with the top 5, but you certainly would have seen rotation probably in the what I’d call the 11 through 20 cohort. And as Ark was indicating when he answered your earlier question is we have several -- maybe more than several customers that have gone from 0 to our top 20 in a year or less. And so we are seeing some programs where there’s a real strategic imperative where the growth accelerates very rapidly and they’re already running in our top 20.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. Just last one real quick. Are you seeing any return to in-person selling or in-person project delivery?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So that means in-person, you mean me on-site? Or it is -- yes, if you’re asking if clients asking us to bring people on-site or in the workplace, then probably not. I think situation in general is still very unstable. And even if there are some movements in the site like 2 weeks later, it’s -- could be consultants. Right now probably everybody kind of in a wait-and-see mode in regard into on-site working.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Maggie Nolan with William Blair.
Maggie Nolan: In a strong demand environment like this, is there an opportunity to evaluate your client portfolio or become more selective over which clients you’d like to work with? And what are your latest thoughts on what an ideal or target client portfolio looks like or profile looks like?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, you’re absolutely right. In this situation, there are opportunities to do it, and we definitely are carefully reviewing the situation and sometimes changing priorities from our standpoint. And yes, we’re looking for ideal clients clearly all the time and probably finding some. But definitely an opportunity. But again, we’re evaluating this carefully and constantly in the past before. Right now, more things to do it. So there is choices right now which we make and where to invest. And again, I don’t know how else to answer your question, but saying yes, we do it.
Jason Peterson: Maggie, in terms of the growth in the -- outside of our top 20, it’s probably coming from exactly the type of decisions that Ark was referring to where we are looking at clients where we think that there’s significant growth potential, but we also think that profitability will be sort of attractive and then we are choosing to sort of staff and grow with those customers. And so I think part of the reason why you’re seeing good growth is not only our ability to bring more resources into the company but also some of the decisions we’re making around somewhat smaller and newer customers that we think have got significant growth potential both in the second half and into 2022.
Maggie Nolan: Okay. And then as you think about the CORE acquisition and maybe future acquisitions you might do, what is the time line for integration into the business? And do you intend to or is it important to let some of these consultancies operate somewhat separately for a period of time?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Any acquisitions which we are doing for some time, we’re trying to understand more details and kind of getting more insight because it’s never possible to have a full picture before closing the deal. So the same is happening right now. And specifically, in consultancies, definitely we will be like looking to what’s happening and what’s the best ways for us to practically in real time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vladimir Bespalov with VTB Capital.
Vladimir Bespalov: First, could you update a little bit about your M&A pipeline? These are getting increasingly important in your growth story. And do you expect more deals to come in the coming couple of quarters maybe? And what expertise and sort of capabilities do you want to develop further with this M&A? And the second question is like on the growth outlook. If we take the 2-year stack, the growth rates that we are seeing are more or less close to your historical levels, something in the mid-20s. But this -- the last couple of years, I would say we’re like quite bumpy. And maybe you could comment with your visibility, let’s say, 1 year ahead. And do we really see some kind of acceleration from the historical levels of growth -- organic growth that we have seen so far?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think let’s start on the second question. And I think I agree with you that for the last couple of years, results are bumpy. But I think the environment around us was very bumpy as well. And I think that’s a collection of those. If we take this out, then our long-term kind of promise to grow in above 20% growth, that’s exactly what we’re targeting, and we’re on the same journey right now. We -- definitely, under this pressure of unknown which is around us, putting some extra efforts and maybe we will find some opportunities to improve what we were thinking about. But again, long term for us, how to grow profitably with 20% organic year-over-year growth and how to maintain security of delivery at the same time. I think that’s good enough challenge. And that’s the target. The rest of this, again, impacted by a lot of changes around us. And the first question was about...
Jason Peterson: M&A.
Arkadiy Dobkin: M&A. And I think here, there is not much changes. We were mentioning before that we’re evaluating the pipeline all the time, that we were looking for new capabilities in market expertise, consulting components, and thinking what would be the best for us, kind of the strategy of our delivery. So it’s all applicable today. That’s -- we closed like 5 deals this year. It just reflects that we found better companies willing to join us. Versus from pipeline point of view -- it was pretty well-developed pipeline. In the past, we have pretty well-developed pipeline. Right now, how many other transactions we’ll be closing in the next 6 to 12 months? We need like to wait and see. And in general, I would like to say like we don’t have a strategy of kind of rolling up acquisitions. We specifically are looking for some which would add capabilities and fill the gaps which we need to fill. So -- and even right now, most of those transactions are pretty small.
Operator: Our next question comes from Surinder Thind with Jefferies.
Surinder Thind: I’d like to start with a big-picture question here. Any color you can provide on perhaps how compressed the times line are clients in terms of trying to get jobs till the project’s done? Meaning pre COVID, what a road map might have looked like and what it looks like nowadays?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Again, I don’t think we’re going to share anything new or what you don’t know. It’s definitely the pressure to perform and to deliver is much higher now in -- I was trying to say post COVID, and we know. Is it post-COVID or still continuous COVID time versus pre-COVID time? That’s definitely changed because everybody understands there is only so much time to adjust business models and build solutions to be able to continuously compete in this continuous COVID time. I mean it is very visible across all markets right now and I think creates pressure on clients and on us as well.
Surinder Thind: Fair enough. I guess what I’m trying to understand here is the client’s appetite. Obviously, everybody wants to get something done today. And so how much work are you perhaps leaving on the table? And then maybe in terms of the ability -- or an earlier question is about you’re now able to do rate increases at midyear. You may be able to push rates at this point. Can you talk a little bit about that dynamic? Because it just seems like you talk about having bigger projects, longer projects. There’s this dynamic of the rate increases. And then how should we think about how that fits into your strategy of adding headcount at this point? I mean what kind of headcount addition should we thinking about?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think it’s kind of a good question. At the same time, we get in our understanding as we speak as well because if 9 months ago somebody will tell you now that we will be growing our talent pool as we’re growing today, we would be very cautious to confirm that it would be possible. At the same time, as we mentioned before, with orchestrating multiple efforts, we say that we can do better than we were thinking in the past. Right now, we’re thinking that probably around 3,000 additions per quarter would be something for us to achieve without much quality risks. Maybe more, but that’s how we’re looking at this. What would be happening in reality, we will see like in a couple of quarters.
Jason Peterson: Yes. And the rate increase question is about what can happen in terms of revenue growth. Certainly, that’s helpful. And you are seeing an expansion of revenue per head. But at the same time, a lot of the conversations that we’re having with clients are informed by the wage inflation we’re seeing. And so clearly, they’re difficult conversations with clients. We’re helping them understand, obviously, what conditions we’re facing with somewhat elevated levels of wage inflation, which is in part then driving the conversation around meeting the higher rates. So like I do want us to leave with the idea that we’re -- we feel good about the demand environment. The demand environment helps us when it comes to rate increases. But at the same time, the 17% to 18% guide that we have for the full year is informed in part by the lower SG&A in 2021. And you’re likely to see somewhat higher SG&A in 2022. And at the same time, we’re going to work hard to sort of maintain and improve gross margins over time.
Surinder Thind: Got it. And so just to clarify the last part, is the idea that when you think about 2022, relative margin stability versus this year? Or are you looking to maybe invest more? Or are we -- I’m just trying to understand how that dynamic is working out because it seems that there’s a really big opportunity here to continue to build up globally and do a lot of things. But at the same time, there’s just structural limitations in those kinds of things as well.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So, well, we back up historically. So you’ll remember that we generally have talked about 16% to 17% as a targeted adjusted type of range. And then we’ve run, in the last couple of years, closer to the top end of that range or somewhat above. And so we guided this year to the 16.5% to 17.5% in part because of what we were seeing and also because we had lower-than-typical SG&A as a percentage of revenue. Right now, with obviously the strength in revenue and ongoing savings in SG&A, we’ve guided to 17% to 18%. But I think as you look forward, I wouldn’t -- I certainly wouldn’t commit to 17% to 18% as a targeted profitability range in future years. So you might think about us coming back to some earlier level in part because, well, we’ll just -- we’ll continue to make investments in delivery centers and in other capabilities so we can continue to grow the business at a high rate.
Operator: Thank you. And I’m currently showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Arkadiy Dobkin for closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you. Thank you, everybody, for joining today. So, as usual, if you have any questions, David is available to help. And looking forward to talk to you in 3 months. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-06 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to the EPAM Systems First Quarter Of 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to David Straube, head of investor relations. Please go ahead.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will begin my summary of the quarter. I want to acknowledge that the past months has been a stark reminder that we are still with a deadly and very major global pandemic and that we must continue to be united in our efforts against COVID. As we have done over the last year, we will do everything possible to support our people on the ground and the communities in which they live and work. Now, turning to our results, for the first quarter, we delivered APM of $781 million in revenues, reflecting growth of 20% year over year with a reported 18% in constant currencies. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.81, a 27% increase over the same quarter in 2020. Both revenue growth, combined with a greater level of profitability enabled us to continue to invest in -- at higher levels across the business. Since we last talked mid-February, we have seen a meaningful increase in demand across our business. The notable consolidation activity in the second half of the quarter. Within fall, core services is very robust as clients doubled down on digital transformation and innovation journeys. Recently, we turned to embark ourselves to not only build new platforms, also to conceive new digital products and services, as well as to modernize and transform the creative technology strategy and delivery models. Digitization trends are driving increasing interests in business strategy, new types of engagement platforms, cloud migration, and modernization efforts, data engineering, and data analytics, engagements, and then to our machine learning, and AI applications. On industry perspective, we are experiencing this dynamic, most notably in life science and healthcare, financial services, insurance, CPG, retail, and to the communications. Today, the focus is on building a stronger vertical expertise to leverage even more effectively our marketing capabilities and current renewed data and cloud. As a result, we still have much more work to do to continue building our integrated consulting propositions on the EPAM Continuum brand. With our increasing depth in vertical domains, we're already realizing the promise of delivering increasingly differentiated all things to our global enterprise customers. One example, EPAM and Equifax is creating a platform developing more than cloud-based applications, products, and services and bringing their data workings to a new generation of consumers. It is a critical part of a multimedia cloud and data-driven reformulation for Equifax where they are working together to build a Google Cloud platform with data fabric to enable Equifax to organize it’s just great legacy data sources into a single seamless structure while keeping all critical development and separation measures in place. Also worth mentioning that while the variety in Equifax legacy system to the cloud nature would normally take years, EPAM successfully assisted in transforming Equifax mainstream applications in less than one year. This is only one example which is repeating across most of markets and verticals themselves from financial services to the bulging interest in retail Intel platforms. We believe it's in this course, the amount of technology led to change the discussion of linguistics into higher levels of activity. All these dynamics have led to that and hopefully soon in post-COVID environment. The number of business demands and processes which must be digitized is going to be rapidly increasing. Those market drivers, along with opportunities in cloud modernization, composable architecture, data, ML and AI, and cybersecurity will give us sizable room for continuous and sustainable growth. To meet this growing demand, we also continue to focus on scaling up our talent. 2020 challenged us to create a reliable and secure remote operations. 2021 has presented an opportunity to leverage those investments in infrastructure, modern target processes, and tooling project load to explore ways in which we can activate broader talent markets and deploy a more diverse set of capabilities. The result is that our project and net headcount growth is accelerating. For Q1, we welcomed approximately 2,300 net hires to EPAM, which included an increase of senior-level hires coming to us with a strong, consistent experience. And overall, since the beginning of Q4 2020, more than 5,400 net additions have joined the company representing the highest level of performers we have added in two consecutive quarters. So, while this shortage of technical and deep-industry talent is a known industry issue, we are confident that our investment in that area are awaiting brand recognition and expanding employee's great journey. We will continue to draw top-down and too far. Also, part of EPAM's growth strategy is the expansion of our capabilities with very focused acquisition efforts, simply because three acquisitions bring into EPAM talent and experience in the areas of salesforce, business intelligence, and security. Therefore, we announced the acquisition of PolSource, a salesforce consultancy with a talent concentration in the U.S., U.K., and Poland. We'll extend to our salesforce series of supply chains as global footprint and provide consolidation for building additional expertise, IP, and scale at our salesforce ecosystem. This acquisition builds on our earlier acquisition of Mulesoft Partner Ricston. It builds our salesforce API capabilities and to enable customers to leverage a multi-cloud approach. Already working closely with PolSource team to bring together a very different proposition, enterprise clients by joining our expanded consulting and global engineering coherence, and to become one of the top global players in the salesforce services space. On Tuesday, we announced the acquisition of White-Hat, a niche cybersecurity consultancy based in Israel. White-Hat's expertise, methodologies, and team with talented professionals will intensify cyber defense capabilities and help clients to further improve cyber protection within their platforms. And lastly, we recently closed an acquisition [indiscernible], an analytics consultancy firm with offices in Europe and Asia, serving customers who are growth retail consumer in their area. This acquisition will bring a team of trusted advisors and experts to provide the full spectrum of data and analytics consultancy, including strategy advisory data management, market-leading accelerators, customize an end-to-end delivery across multiple vendor platforms and solutions. We are pleased to acquire these three companies due in part. In conclusion, we're encouraged about the road ahead. During the last twelve months, we proved our leadership position in the digital segment of a very competitive global IT services market. EPAM today is much more adaptable, diverse, and global company with increasingly strong market listings, and all the necessary components of a scalable talent ecosystem which are required for growth as we think about to finally becoming a $5 billion to $10 billion company. With that, let me hand the call over to Jason to provide more specifics in our Q1 results, update to our 2021 business outlook.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our performance this quarter. As Ark mentioned, we delivered strong growth across a broad range of industry verticals and geographies. First-quarter APM generated revenues of $780.8 million, a year-over-year increase of 19.9% on a reported basis and 17.8% in constant currency, reflecting a positive foreign change impact of 210 basis points. Revenues came in higher than previously guided due to stronger demand in the second half of the quarter, combined with our ability to accelerate hiring in response to the improving demand environment. Our industry vertical performance produced strong sequential growth across the majority of the portfolio and by higher-level revenues from both new works at existing clients and new customer relationships established over the last 12 months. Looking at the year-over-year performance across our industry verticals, life science and healthcare grew 31.6%. Growth in the quarter was driven by platform development to support new business models and data and analytics to drive deeper customer insights. Financial services grew 28.3%, growth coming from traditional banking, insurance, and to a lesser degree, wealth management. Growth was driven by our clients' need to transform beyond digital banking to modernize core processes and applications, leveraging the cloud. Software and high-tech grew 20.7% in the quarter. Travel and consumer grew 16.3%, driven by strong growth from our consumer clients, along with a solid and improving performance with retail. Business information and media delivered 6.5% growth in the quarter. Growth in the quarter reflected a tougher comparison with the same quarter last year. Several clients having experienced substantial growth in the first half of 2020 with revenues from those programs generally plateauing late last year. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered 23.6% growth, driven by clients in telecommunications, automotive, and materials. From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region representing 60.2% of our Q1 revenues grew 20.6% year over year or 19.9% in constant currency. Europe, representing 33.2% of our Q1 revenues grew 16.3% year over year or 10.9% in constant currency. CIS, representing 3.9% of our Q1 revenues grew 21.2% year over year and 28.2% in constant currency. Finally, APAC grew 53.9% year over year or 48.4% in constant currency, and now represents 2.7% of our revenues. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by clients in financial services. Additionally, the shutdown of economic activity in the region in March 2020 produced a beneficial year-over-year comparison. In Q1, revenue growth across the portfolio was more diverse than in previous quarters. Our top 20 clients growing 12.1%, while clients outside our top 20 grew 25.9%. Additionally, we saw good growth in both existing and new clients. Moving on to income statement, our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 33.5%, compared to 34.9% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 34.9%, compared to 35.5% for the same quarter last year. The lower gross margin in the quarter was primarily the result of Q1 2021 having one less available day of capacity -- Q1 2020. Additionally, we're beginning to see some degree of elevated labor costs in certain geographies. GAAP SG&A was 17.5% of revenue and compared to 19.2% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A came in at 15.5% of revenue, compared to 17.6% in the same period last year. SG&A continue -- continues to reflect a lower level of corporate spend, which we believe will tick up as we progress throughout the year. GAAP income from operations was $107.3 million or 13.7% of revenue in the quarter, compared to $87.5 million, 13.4% of revenue in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $136.9 million or 17.5% of revenue in the quarter, compared to $105.3 million, 16.2% of revenue in Q1 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 5.1%, which includes a lower-than-expected level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits was 22.7%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.86. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.81, reflecting a 26.6% increase over the same quarter in 2020. In Q1, there were approximately 58.8 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to the cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q1 was $12.8 million, compared to $63.3 million in the same quarter of 2020. Free cash flow was 1.6 million compared to 34.2 million in the same quarter last year. Lower level of cash flow in the quarter was a result of timing of payments related to our annual variable compensation programs returning to more historic norms. Additionally, income tax payments were higher compared to the same quarter in 2020. We ended the quarter with 1.37 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Q1 DSO was 67 days and compares to 64 days in Q4 2020. 76 days in the same quarter last year. We believe we can continue managing DSO levels in the upper 60s. Moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended the quarter with more than 38,800 engineers, designers, and consultants, a year-over-year increase of 17.3% and a sequential increase of 5.7%. Total headcount for Q1 was 43,450 employees. Utilization was 81.4%, compared to 79.5% in Q1 of last year and 77.9% in Q4 2020. Now let's turn to guidance. We continue to see strong demand across a broad range of our offerings. The elevated demand across the portfolio, combined with improvements in staffing capacity, we are raising our revenue and EPS outlook for 2021. I mentioned during our last earnings call, throughout 2021, we will be investing at elevated levels across the business to support growing demand, and we will continue our expansion into new geographies, underpinning our long-term growth objectives and goal of becoming a large -- both a larger and increasingly global EPAM. Starting with our full-year outlook. Revenue growth will now be at least 29% on a reported basis, and in constant currency terms, will now be at least 28% after factoring in an approximate 1% favorable foreign exchange impact. We now expect approximately 200 basis points of revenue contribution to come from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months. We expect GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%, and non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. As mentioned earlier, our income from operations reflects a higher level of investment in the planned expansion of our capabilities and geographies in 2021. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to continue to be approximately 12%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to continue to be approximately 23%. Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.09 to $7.31 for the full year. Non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.54 to $7.76 for the full year. We expect weighted average share count of 59 million fully diluted shares outstanding. In Q2 of 2021, we expect revenues to be in the range of 853 million to 861 million, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 35.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect a favorable impact of FX on revenue growth to be approximately 3%. Lastly, we now expect approximately 250 basis points of revenue contribution to come from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months. In the second quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%, and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 11% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to be approximately 23%. Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.76 to $1.83 for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.88 to $1.95 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately 21.8 million in Q2, 21.5 million in Q3, and 21.2 million in Q4. Monetization on intangibles is expected to be approximately $3.1 million for each of the remaining quarters. Impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $1.5 million loss for each of the remaining quarters. Tax-effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $5.7 million in Q2 and approximately $5.5 million in each remaining quarter. And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around 14.2 million in Q2, 2.2 million in Q3 to 8.6 million in Q4. In summary, we are pleased with the high-quality results we delivered in the quarter, which combined with the broad-based strength we see across the business, provide support for strong 2021 performance. Operator, let's open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open.
Bryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask on the outlook first. Can you talk about where the strongest recoveries in demand have been that enabled the upside guidance raise here? And are you seeing improved pricing discussions with existing clients? Or is this upside predominantly being driven by volume more?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So the upside would predominantly be generated by volume. And so what we are seeing is that there's a whole wave of modernization programs kicking off within the financial services industry. So a significant amount of growth expected, as you saw in Q1, but also probably further acceleration of growth in financial services in Q2 due to the modernization programs with large banks and then also with a much-accelerated growth in insurance. We're seeing recovery in the travel and consumer section of our portfolio, quite strong growth with, consumer-oriented programs, both in retail and with consumer goods companies. We're even beginning to see some sequential growth in the travel space. We're seeing strong growth in healthcare and life sciences. We're seeing, a continued sort of solid growth in our traditional sort of high-tech software and high-technology clients. And we're seeing, a reemergent kind of emerging verticals with very strong growth in telecommunications, automotive, and materials, as we talked about. And again, where we expect between Q1 and Q2, we expect to see, even stronger growth in financial services, even stronger growth than Q1 in the travel and hospitality vertical, and, again, even stronger growth in the emerging verticals. And so again, it is pretty broad-based. It's existing relationships. It's new relationships. So we're seeing some good new customer revenues. And then from a pricing environment, I think we're having more constructive conversations with clients. And I think both existing and new clients understand that with the wage inflation that's out there in the marketplace, that it is going to, likely require somewhat higher pricing to support the addition of new teams. But for the most part, this is volume-based.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. And then on margin, you talked about building cadence, particularly during, I think, the second half of the year, which would suggest you're pretty well set up within the outlook. But did you have any investments that had shifted within the year? Or any changes in your expectation on the scale of talent investments? Can you dig in a little bit on that elevated labor cost comment you had?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So, we're expanding, our capacity in terms of adding staff. And probably -- that would probably more show up in the SG&A portion. I think that as we look at gross margin, if I were to, be very clear, I think we're expecting now that gross margin might be slightly lower, not lower than Q1, but lower than our original expectations for 2021 based on this updated guidance. But SG&A will also be somewhat lower. And so we're able to maintain the profitability in the 16.5% to 17.5% range that we've talked about with a real focus on the midpoint, 17%. But we are seeing, somewhat elevated levels of compensation being required both to retain and bring staff, into EPAM. And that's something that we're mindful of, both as we produce the guidance and as obviously, we try to drive the company throughout the remainder of the year.
Bryan Bergin: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Your line is open.
Maggie Nolan: Thank you. To build up on some of those talent questions, any changes to the geographic focus that you talked about last quarter with Poland, India, and Mexico, just given some of the talent challenges? And then as you broaden your capabilities and become a more global company, what do you think is the right distribution of that talent in terms of onshore, nearshore, and offshore locations?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don't think there are significant changes in the direction from the locations like we talked about India, we talked about Mexico, and we continue to -- to grow with them. Actually, India, probably the fastest-growing for us components in talent composition right now. So from this point of view, again, we each year becoming more distributed and more [indiscernible] balanced, and concentration is going down in Eastern Europe, so -- which is normal with the growth of the company and globalization of our clients as well. So, in terms of what's the best offshore, onshore, we're still increasing -- increase in our onshore component. Especially with the complexity of the engagement, we're doing a necessity to have strong industry connectivity and consulting connectivity. So that's growing, but it's not drastically changing as well. So, we're very careful at managing the balance right now. So what is ideal? I don't think anybody knows. So it's very dynamically changing, even if you think about what's happened in 2020, continue in 2021. I don't think anybody talking about ideal right now.
Maggie Nolan: Okay. And then, Jason, I understand the current gross margin dynamics that you just outlined and the expectations. But when you think about more kind of medium term and becoming a more global company, does that allow you to start to drive gross margins back up over time? Or what should we expect over kind of a more medium-term time frame?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So let me try to be -- so on the, I guess, the 34.9% adjusted gross margin that we booked here in Q1, the lower-level gross margin was, in part, the result of there being one less available day at capacity in the quarter. And so that's -- it's just the way that Monday through Friday falls in the calendar for Q1. It was one less day than what we would have traditionally seen in previous Q1s. However, I do think we are seeing, somewhat elevated levels of wage inflation. And, those could continue to elevate throughout the fiscal year. So I think that in the -- let's call it, in the -- throughout the remainder of the year, I think we might run below the approximate sort of 36% that we've kind of talked about over time from a gross margin standpoint. It is -- I think it's sort of generally stabilized at a slightly lower level than that 36%. But -- so I don't expect it to continue to decline. And I think the question mark is kind of what happens in 2022. Right now, again, I am feeling that we've kind of -- gross margin is going to stabilize. And then we'll kind of see what happens throughout the remainder of the year in terms of, the pricing environment. And I think we'll be able to provide a little bit better guidance probably later in this fiscal year.
Maggie Nolan: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Jason Peterson: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
James Faucette: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask on hiring. The 2,000 net headcount addition looks really strong, especially considering the competitive environment for talent. Can you provide a bit of an update on hiring and the traction you're seeing on anywhere? And I guess just generally, your hiring strategy for fiscal year '21. And what do you think is achievable or sustainable given just the strong competition and demand for high-skill talent right now?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we're comfortable with current level of guidance. So I think thinking about a couple of thousand net new per quarter should be achievable for this year. Maybe a little bit higher, we will see. But based on our understanding of the market, which is extremely challenging. I don't want to downplay it like message which you're probably hearing from any other company. So we should be definitely included. It's extremely challenging talent market. But with the geographical distribution we have today and which we were building during the last five, six years very, very purposely, so I simply would be able to continue with the pace which we have in Q1.
Jason Peterson: Got it. Got it. And then you announced the White-Hat acquisition yesterday. Just what's your appetite for further acquisitions this year? And what kinds of capabilities do you think are important to be looking for and looking to add?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Really nothing changing in our direction in M&A. So it just happened this quart -- this quarter, it was three of them. And to be in constant -- in constant social and constant discussions. Also, need to understand that two of these is pretty small boutique type of consultancies. We just add in right capabilities to the base which we have. So -- we did mention our traditional kind of approach for acquisitions. We were looking for mostly capabilities and some geographical diversification as well. And I think, again, that's what we're going to do in the future too.
James Faucette: That's great. Hey, thanks a lot guys, and all I can say is keep it going. All right.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Hey, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys, this is Kathy on for Jason. Just wanted to ask about utilization. What's your comfort level that this around 81%? Kind of I know you guys were slowing a little bit in sequential headcount growth but still very strong. I just wanted to know kind of how are you balancing that and what's the real sweet spot on utilization?
Jason Peterson: Yes. When we're running at 81%, that would still generally be hot. So we're -- we continue to explore kind of what the right level is. I think we believe that, somewhere in the high 70s continues to be a better place for us because it does allow us to be more prepared for new customer engagements and for unexpected expansion at existing customers. And so I would say that as we think about the remainder of the year, we're, we're thinking more in that -- in the high 70s. We also think that there's some possibility that there could be some elevated vacation taking in the second half. If you think about all of the unused vacation that's out there from 2020, our revenue guidance would also incorporate some amount of lower utilization due to, further vacation taking in the summer and fall months.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Perfect. And just a follow-up question. I wanted to ask, has there been any change in deal sizes that you guys have seen or, an update kind of on the pace of converting backlog to revenue? It sounds like you guys are -- haven't had any problems, but, just want to get an update there.
Jason Peterson: I mean, there's been a series recently of I would say quite large modernization programs that are likely to be multiyear in length that have kind of kicked off. And, as we discussed it, that we continue to engage with our customers in let's say a somewhat different way than maybe we would have five years ago, where with that broader sort of consulting solutioning, and then, of course, sort of delivery capability. And I think you're seeing more of those types of engagements as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Moshe Katri with Wedbush. Your line is open. Moshe, you may be muted.
David Straube: Operator, why don't we go to the next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shivaikar with Citi. Your line is open now.
Ashwin Shivaikar: Thanks, Ark and Jason.
Jason Peterson: Hey, Ashwin.
Ashwin Shivaikar: Hi. So I think my first question, you guys mentioned both elevated labor costs, and I'm wondering, is it in any particular geo? And the flip side of it, you mentioned pricing, and I wanted to point out if that's either more naturally capabilities-based or are clients willing to pay up for the, the shortage of talent?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think to the wage inflation. And this is -- probably, it would be fair to say that is across all markets, including in-markets as well. So as you can see from the sector right now, there are significant increase in demand. It says it so. So in regards to pricing, I think Jason mentioned that, at this point, majority of the revenue growth is coming specifically from the volume of work we're doing. But the record utilization we started to care for that. I think they're becoming right now a much more realistic from both clients -- from client side as well. And we do expect some pricing improvement. And specifically, in the big programs led by consulting efforts too. So -- but it's a little bit too early to talk about it right now.
Ashwin Shivaikar: Got it. Got it. Okay. And then, I know that there's always churn in sort of the top 20 client list, top 10 client list, that thing. But clients outside top 20 growing faster, is that -- do you think that's a general sustainable trend whereby just as, newer relationship just kick off and ramp much faster than expected? Is that what you're seeing?
Jason Peterson: Yes, I think when we look at the pipeline that we expect, it's a trend that would certainly continue in Q2 where, again, we have, more rapid growth in our other than top 20 than in our top 20. And so the -- and then we'll see what happens throughout the remainder of the year. But, I think last year was a little bit unique, right, where we had, it did -- probably a series of customers in our top 10 who are very large corporations who were probably less impacted by the pandemic in terms of their business. And those companies continue to grow quite rapidly. I think this year, what you're beginning to see is some of the new relationships we established in 2020. And then also relationships that we've had for long periods of time, but where the clients are looking to do, very important, kind of modernization programs. They're looking to EPAM, and that's driving growth as well and that's in the other than top 20 customers.
Ashwin Shivaikar: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Jamie Friedman with SIG. Your line is open.
Jamie Friedman: Hi, good morning. Great results here. I want to ask you, Ark, about two things you had in your prepared remarks. So the first one was about the theme of data digitization, I think was the language that you were using. I'm just wondering, do you consider that like modernization? Last quarter, you started talking about systems integration. How would you characterize -- character -- like categorize where data digitization is classified?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don't think it was a data digitization term. I think it was -- some quarter to your follow-up call today wasn't best. And I was talking about general and much more kind of traditional term, digitization in general. And clearly, data and cloud, and AI, ML, all lend significant roles there. So what -- I didn't try to invent another term.
Jamie Friedman: And then I did notice though that you -- so you said $5 billion to $10 billion as the target for the company. I realize you haven't given a time frame. But my recollection is that's a little bit different -- bigger than what you had said previously, which was just to double. So any context that you could share on the 10 especially because that's a lot more than five would be helpful.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, that's a little good -- that's a little good discussion clearly to you. I know as if you're watching us for a very long time. I mean, practically before nine years ago and you remember us back then. And you saw what was happening after IPO when we were changing everything from offering to our delivery kind of landscape to make sure that we were looking for the number of years ahead. And we practically were doubling company each three years. If not pandemic, we probably would be down within -- at the end of this year against three years ago. And who knows. But if you put even slower pace, then it is pretty practical thinking on our side right now how to become a company of five or -- 5 billion or higher. So -- and that's how we're thinking about building as a company, and not just for the next quarter.
Jamie Friedman: Got it. Thank you. I'll drop back in the queue.
Operator: Our next question comes from Randy El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. It's Damian on for Ramsey. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask again on margins here. But maybe I'll do it in the context of employee travel. I think, obviously, as the world starts to normalize, the expectation is that there's a little bit more employee travel. So to the extent that that is included in your margin assumptions, about to get that. And maybe on that same subject, Ark, we'd love to just get your high-level thoughts on sort of this virtual delivery. In the thick of the pandemic, I remember your view as sort of, it's going to continue to stick around for the long term. But are you all seeing any change to what your clients are looking for in terms with -- of how you engage with them?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it's still too early to judge what's going to happen. There are definitely a desire from all of us to get in work in some type of more traditional conversations, seeing each other versus the screen. Some clients are actually talking about it. But at the same time, it's still very difficult to predict what would happen. And also, like our understanding what's happening and changing on the fly, like even a couple of months ago, I personally would be much more optimistic about vaccination process. And right now, it's not clear if it would be based on what exists 50% even in the U.S. So -- and as soon as you look into the global map, who knows how this would work for 2021 for all of us. So at the same time, if you're talking about like working environment in much more distributed way, I think that's what we were focusing way before pandemic hit. And I think that's what happened. And I think productivity not really impacted. And at the same time, it's pushed a lot of these believers in this highly distributed way of working and had to accept it, which making all of this to work even better. So I think that would stay. I think our human partners, everybody understand and talking about, will take all -- maybe [indiscernible] Again, too early right now to judge.
Jason Peterson: Yes. And quickly, on the margin front, I think we had modeled that the second half of the year would move toward some degree of normalcy. But as Ark just said, it's unclear that we end up there, in the second half. But the idea was that there would be some, increase in costs. We still think that there's some temporary benefits that we're seeing in the P&L. But I believe that we are seeing greater efficiency in SG&A and we're -- some of that's going to stick in future years. So that's kind of how I think about the business right now. As you know, as I said before, running very much in the midpoint of that 16.5% to 17.5% range, which is, at pretty much the top end of the range that we used to use at 16% to 17%.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And so we definitely accounted that -- for the situation that if everything suddenly improved, then travel might pick up. So we're thinking about it and it was in our numbers right now. But again, not clear if was going to happen or not.
Unidentified Analyst: That's very helpful. Thank you all for the color there. Maybe I'll just do a quick follow-up here on involuntary attrition. Just if you could speak a little bit about what you're seeing in your employee base and how that sort of change since it's way to the beginning of the pandemic, but just an update on involuntary attrition would be great. Thanks guys.
Jason Peterson: So I'm going to assume the voluntary or rather than involuntary? Or do we still have these all just kind of talk?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, right, involuntary. Thanks.
Jason Peterson: So with attrition -- yes, attrition in Q1, for the entire quarter is still relatively low below 15%. It's actually somewhat lower than it was in Q1 of 2020. However, we are beginning to see some degree of elevation and attrition at the end of the quarter in March and here again in April. And so again, we are below 15% and again, I think, we're well within our expectations for the quarter as a whole but beginning to see some increase in attrition both at the end of Q1 and the beginning of Q2.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vladimir Bespalov with VTB Capital. Your line is open.
Vladimir Bespalov: Hello. Congratulations on the number and thank you for taking my question. My first question will be about your latest acquisition. You are clearly moving to the cybersecurity area, which probably has not been that much of a focus before. Could you please provide more color? Are you looking at this area as a new big opportunity or this is still going to be kind of complementary to your offering to the clients? And my second question will be on price discounts. Last year, during the pandemic you provided price discounts to clients, but this should be expiring now. What -- will this help you to generate more revenues and to help with pricing? Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So on the first question about cybersecurity, it was all an important part for us when we built applications and platforms because, at the end of the day, that's one of the main points to make sure that it's secure enough as we all understand. And we organically developed practice and capabilities but similarly, with others, there are capabilities that are important for kind of overall platform engineering, so we needed additional skills. And as I mentioned, it's a relatively small consultancy but is a very high experience and we just got to be part of our global engineering practice, which important to us to make sure that everything's good. So I think it's -- very, very simple answer here. There's nothing special to it.
Jason Peterson: Yes. On the pricing front, you're right. The COVID concessions are pretty much gone at this point. That would have already sort of showed up in the Q1 numbers and in the guide for Q2. So I don't think that there's too much uplift to be expected from that. And as we've talked about, we're increasingly having not always easy but let's call them constructive conversations with clients about pricing.
Vladimir Bespalov: Thank you very much.
Jason Peterson: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.
David Grossman: Thank you. Good morning. I want to first if you could just perhaps give us a little more insight into your commentary about modernization in the financial services industry and that being a driver of modern growth. Could you just give us a little more detail on what exactly you're referring to and if there's a specific catalyst that may be driving these larger programs?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Again, I don't think we have time here for proving discussion but it's still pretty generic and pretty much in line with everybody else talking about is our -- even our example, which we were showing this morning about programs in building infrastructure and applications to the cloud with very often additional functionality and upgrading this and maybe with a very different target environment. That's huge, huge efforts across multiple capabilities usually touching on legacy, data, analytics, and everything. So I don't know what specific we can add here but when this is online, we went in from one point of view and going to, again, cloud and new architecture from another point of view and probably could describe the full scale of this.
David Grossman: Okay. Thanks. We can take that offline. And then, the second question I had it was -- I know there's already been a lot of questions about pricing, wage inflation, margins. But I'm just curious why is this playing out differently than historically where the market is a little more dynamic in terms of responding to that imbalance? It sounds like you're being a little more guarded about, kind of that ability to get pricing at least near term. So is there something different in the market, is it that the market may be pricing in some of the more secular OpEx, savings from a work from home kind of environment or it might just misinterpreting this and this is just the typical dynamic that you see?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So I think one of the questions you're asking is whether or not with work from home that's impacting pricing and that clients are somehow asking for either no rate increase or savings from that. Is what you're asking, David? Or –
David Grossman: Well, that was just kind of a guess on my part that what could be going on. But the bigger question is just why the market isn't responding as quickly to the supply demand balance that you're talking about in terms of service and the churn –
Jason Peterson: I think, David, I think it just takes time, right? As you would know with both, in the engagements that you negotiate pricing and SOWs and everything that are in place. It takes some time and then, of course, clients have got budgets and clients are still trying to work their way through what happened last year. So those conversations are definitely accelerating but probably a little bit of disconnect just based on the economic disruption of last year. And I think this conversation will continue to potentially accelerate as soon as we work through the remainder of the year. I don't know, Ark, do you have thoughts here?
Arkadiy Dobkin: No, I agree. I think it is timing because it's to create change from we don't know what would be happening to run and I think there is going to be put to this, but we'll see. And maybe partially you guess also carried out as well because some may think there are ideas that are probably cheaper result infrastructure. But it's not necessarily true because the investment on support and distributed. And again, at the time, because it's all very kind of really connected and might require even more investment.
David Grossman: Right. And just one last question just that I think this came up in another question as well about growth outside the top 20. But my recollection is that over the last 12 months, particularly during the pandemic, that you had to prioritize in your capacity utilization to those larger customers, longer-term customers. Is some of that growth -- because this is more of a normalized kind of dynamic for you with that growth outside the top 20. Is that just an indication that we're back toward a normalized operating environment or is it something different than that?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don't know if you are trying to drive some conclusions from this dynamic. I think there are some big clients who are inside of the top 20, which is growing very aggressively. There are some clients who just slow down practically flat out. And there are several clients who become just 12, 18 months ago who now become a part of the top 20. I don't know if it's a function of the market or is it more of a function of EPAM changing dynamic as well. So I think probably it's more on the second one where results often can now accelerate some clients' development and trust.
David Grossman: Got it. Okay, guys, thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Nichols with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jack Nichols: Hey, good morning. This is Jack on for Steve Enders. What trends are you seeing with the count consolidation within your accounts and what's been your ability to capture an incremental share of wallet?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I would answer very, very short. So I think we're pretty creative in our ability to consolidate in some accounts right now. I think we reduce the budget inside of the accounts.
Jason Peterson: I think you'd certainly see that performance in financial services that would give you some indication that we have had some success there.
Jack Nichols: Okay. Perfect thanks. And you've talked about investing more in your consulting business. How are those investments resonating and how much have you been able to capture consulting services within your customers?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. As we mentioned like many, many times, we're not trying to just capture consulting services as our business, we're trying to get into the conversations with the clients much earlier in the game to make sure that we can actually drive the next step that tells the consulting kind of activities to do more practical implementations of the platforms. And I think, again, we are pretty happy with the progress, which we do in like quarter after quarter. And we're getting new use cases and we're getting higher in the kind of value chain and create in these examples. But again, it's not about just chase the consulting market as a pure consultant creative.
Jack Nichols: Okay, great. Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arvind Ramnani with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Arvind Ramnani: I'd like to add, congrats on a great quarter. I have a question on some of the sort of emerging technologies that you are working on. In a couple of years back, you were working on and kind of blockchain technologies, are you starting to see kind of interest in those -- in the areas of blockchain, and is that becoming a meaningful portion of your kind of capabilities? And similar to blockchain, is it the stuff around like AI that you are working with clients?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It's difficult to say that blockchain becomes a significant driver but it's definitely part of normal engagement like any other advanced technologies as well. And we definitely see and also some pickups well in AI engagement while it's still a relatively small portion of what's happening. We think it might accelerate in the future but because, again, a lot of preparation in the last several years is to create a data infrastructure capable to support this type of new application. And I think I would finish with this.
Arvind Ramnani: Great. And just like -- but I guess within your digital, which is kind of a very broad word. Are there particular areas within digital that you're seeing really fast growth? I mean, like I said, digital is extremely broad, it could mean many different things. But are there specific technologies that you're seeing really high growth or really high levels of client interest?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think I would prefer and even from my kind, I wouldn't talk about very broad terms. And clearly, again, everybody knows that all this cloud modernization is a driver. And around this, a lot of different things are important, but I wouldn't call anything specifically right now.
Arvind Ramnani: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions. I like to turn the call back over to Ark for any closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, everybody, for your time today to participate. And as you know, if you have any questions, David is available to help. So talk to you in three months. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-18 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the EPAM Systems Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
David Straube: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the Company’s fourth quarter fiscal 2020 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today’s call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today’s call may contain Forward-Looking Statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the Company’s earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me start from taking a look back to 2020, which we all know was a very different year for all of us, to say the least. In preparation for today call, I briefly reviewed what we were thinking and what we were sharing during the last year, starting from 12-months back and then nine, six and just three-months ago. I think it tells an interesting story. February last year, still full of hope for another practically normal year for us with 20-plus percent organic growth, focusing on our adaptive enterprise story and in short, looking optimistically into 2020. Just three-months later, we are still reporting 26% constant currency growth for Q1. We, like everybody else at the time, didn’t understand at all where we would end up and what we would have to do to go over this very uncertain and very fast worsening situation. The situation, when more than 30% of our client portfolio experienced some form of revenue impact, we practically had to reorganize ourselves on the line and to start preparation for a very defensive play for protecting as a first priority will be in power people and ensuring continued liquidity and viability of our business. When thinking about the time now, I really would like to share again our deep appreciation to the thousand EPAMers who did everything possible to support each other as a company, to our clients for trusting us with their most critical issues, and to our many extended communities around the world. At that point, we really didn’t know how the 2020 would end up for us and for our clients. In another three-months, to our surprise, we saw the first signs of some stabilization and client realization of new reality and necessity to start preparing for the future, which will be impacted by such new reality for a long enough period, if not forever. It pushed our drive for agility and an urgent need to adaptive enterprise transformation even further. Time was very condensed and made us as a Company become much more closely connected by sharing information and making decision much faster than ever before. At this point, we also realized that while our original plans for 2020 will not be in-line with our financial performance realities, most of these planned changes, which we outlined for ourselves back in normal times, will be very much accelerating from strategic transformational standpoints. During the period, we ended also several large new logos and started to see that we will take an increasingly larger share of our portfolio across several existing strategic for our clients, which was encouraging. Finally, just three-months ago, while seeing many new geopolitical turbulences in locations where we operate and have significant presence, we still become comfortable enough to remind everybody again and to our sales, first of all. The goal we stated 12-months back in our last Investor Day, the goal of turning EPAM into a truly adaptive company. We become comfortable simply because of our realization of how much we advance to the growth during those all around very challenging nine-months. Thanks to our investments into integrated consulting with EPAM Continuum, into cloud-enabled business transformation efforts and data analytics, AI and the test set of capabilities, strongly supported by our engineering DNA and be much more flexible. Scalable and distributed delivery locations and delivery models, enabled in turn by our digital tie in productivity knowledge and educational platform or our EPAM anywhere per time. We believe all those investments are paying back and preparing us strongly for the future growth. In regard to EPAM Continuum, I would like to mention also that today, we see not only recognition of these new service offerings from leading analysts, but encouraging take of the new proposition from a broad base of clients around the world and across all verticals in insurance and financial services, consumer and life sciences, to name a few. Our approach to EPAM Continuum goes beyond our working market, but extended very much into cross-pollination of all EPAM capabilities and experiences through network organizational approach comprised of people, tools and shared ways of working, which should enable us to build global, agile and expert teams more quickly and more efficiently. While this work is ongoing and represents a significant portion of our investment agenda, we are seeing strong results today in our current portfolio, results that are driving higher value for customers and that enabling EPAM to scale larger and complex program faster than ever in the past. During last year, we shared several specific studies already. Those included at [indiscernible] story as well as a large healthcare technology platform, which not just became our fastest-growing client in 2020, but is already among our top 10 clients currently. In addition to those, let us share two short new stories. The first one started just over a year-ago as an agile engineering program as a top 10 global property and casualty insurance giant. Since then, EPAM has become the go-to transformation and IT strategy and implementation partner, helping the company to transform its IT and digital project functions to accelerate cloud transformation journey and to position the company for innovation through a combination of the strategy consulting and engineering implementation services. The second is very recent engagement for global retail and wholesale pharmacy leader. EPAM provides full value stream services, including product management, design, end-to-end engineering. The client is building an Omni-channel care management product, including clinical, physical services, device and digital elements and is making full use of our integrated research experience, consulting physical digital product design, on top of our traditional engineering capabilities. So everything I have mentioned is made possible by the ongoing investment in our business, which will remain our consistent priority, and we do expect indeed even higher levels of investment in 2021 to keep place with our growth needs. Moving on to our numbers, and let’s start from 2020 results. For fiscal 2020, we ended at close to 2.7 billion in revenues, reflecting 16% year-over-year constant currency growth, which included double-digit growth in the majority of our industry verticals. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.34, a 17% increase over fiscal 2019. Lastly, we generated 476 million of free cash flow for the year. A result, it was more than 2.5 times the average of our last four-years. For the people front, for the year, we welcomed more than 4,400 new net employees to EPAM across our client-facing teams and corporate functions. At this point, I would like to remind also that during all 2020, we were very consistently repeating the very simple statement. We strongly believe our position as a leading provider of digital product and platform engineering services, combined with our maturing consulting expertise, is our key differentiator. And we are confident in our ability to come out of this challenging time, a more value-based and result-driven company that will continue growing as the post-pandemic environment at a 20%-plus organic growth rate again. It wasn’t an obvious statement, especially at the beginning. But we think that what was happening during the past 12-months is very telling. From our practically worst quarter ever with a sequential drop in revenue in Q2 to probably the best sequential growth we saw during the last decade when we increased revenue in Q4 2020 by almost 11% in comparison with our Q3 result. So looking ahead to 2021, we see a market that continues to be very active and want to demonstrate strong demand for our services. With the events of the past year, our clients are adapting to changing landscape, which requires hybrid business models and different ways of interacting with their customers in the end market. This requires even faster pace of transformation. The organization of application as well as the building of expansion of the platform with connect and power enterprise, enabled first by the cloud and the need for really co-innovation partners. It means that we will have to lead large-scale transformation with consulting. Product development engagement with design, data monetization and process optimization engagement with analytics, digital technology and custom platform development engagement with engineering. And all of those to be led by strong alignment with our clients and some other key platform partners. Regarding market size. In the past, we spoke about EPAM positioning in the fast-growing digital platform product engineering segment, which analysts estimate to be more than $150 billion. While we still firmly position us with such a segment, we are seeing enhanced opportunities for EPAM to play in the broad application development and cloud integration services market, which leading analysts are projecting be resurging in the post-pandemic environment. In combination of custom software development, cloud-native integration work, technology consulting and training services, and which represents a total over $700 billion in 2021 alone or about 60% of the total global IT services market. While thinking about this in context of new demand for EPAM and the lagging effect of the pandemic to our customers, we still anticipate some continued disruption in a few of our customers and markets and probably longer-term damage for certain industries. However, today, when 2020 is already in the past and while we are obviously still not being out of post-pandemic time zone and specific geopolitical risks, we do believe the 2021 will be a year of to 20-plus percent growth organically. With that, let me hand the call over to Jason to provide more specifics in our 2020 results and our annual business outlook, which we are presuming for fiscal 2021.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our 2020 fiscal year performance, especially given the dynamic environment. Our results demonstrate the durability of our portfolio, adaptability of our people and highlight EPAM’s ability to meet the needs of clients even during challenging times. In the fourth quarter, EPAM generated revenue of $723.5 million, a year-over-year increase of 14.3% on a reported basis and 13.7% in constant currency terms, reflecting a positive foreign exchange impact of approximately 60 basis points. Revenue came in higher than previously guided due to our ability to expand our delivery capacity in response to a stronger-than-anticipated demand environment. Revenues also benefited somewhat from the aforementioned foreign exchange contribution. Our industry vertical performance in Q4 produced very strong sequential improvement, driven by a higher level of growth from both new work and existing clients and revenue from new customer relationships established over the last 12-months. Looking at year-over-year performance across this group. Life Sciences & Healthcare grew 24%. Growth in the quarter was driven by data and analytics, platform development to support new business models and client investments to improve R&D efficiency. Business information and media delivered 16.2% growth in the quarter. Financial services grew 16.1% with growth coming from traditional banking, insurance and, to a lesser degree, wealth management. Software & Hi-Tech grew 14.3% in the quarter. Travel and Consumer returned to growth and increased 5.4% year-over-year. In Q4, we saw strong growth from our consumer clients, along with solid and improving performance within retail as clients made investments in response to the dramatic changes in their operating environments. Finally, our emerging vertical delivered 13.1% growth, driven by clients in telecommunications, automotive and materials. From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region, representing 59.9% of our Q4 revenues, grew 14% year-over-year or 13.7% in constant currency. Europe, representing 32% of our Q4 revenues, grew 11.8% year-over-year or 7.5% in constant currency. CIS, representing 5.2% of our Q4 revenues, grew 22.9% year-over-year and 45.2% in constant currency. Similar to Q3, growth in the CIS region was driven primarily by clients in financial services and materials. And finally, APAC grew 39.4% year-over-year or 35.7% in constant currency terms and now represents 2.9% of our revenues. APAC growth in the quarter was primarily driven by clients in financial services. In the fourth quarter, year-over-year growth in our top 20 clients was 16.6%, and growth outside our top 20 clients was 12.8%. And moving down the income statement. As mentioned last quarter, we continue to run the business with a cost base that is lower than previous levels. While the lower cost base is driven by operational efficiencies we have delivered across the business, there are also temporary contributors, including reduced travel, relocations and certain administrative expenses producing lower levels of SG&A spend over the last three quarters. Looking forward, we expect a higher level of cost in a post-pandemic environment, but anticipate that some of the efficiency benefits may be maintained longer term. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35.6% compared to 35.2% in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 36.9% compared to 36.7% for the same quarter last year. GAAP SG&A was 17.8% of revenue compared to 19.8% in Q4 of last year. And non-GAAP SG&A came in at 16.2% of revenue compared to 18.1% in the same period of last year. Our SG&A results continue to see short-term benefits from the previously mentioned items. GAAP income from operations was 112 million or 15.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to 84.7 million or 13.4% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was 135.9 million or 18.8% of revenue in the quarter compared to 107.6 million or 17% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 16.2%, which includes a lower-than-expected level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits, was 22.6%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.46. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.81, reflecting a 19.9% increase over the same quarter in fiscal 2019.In Q4, there were approximately 58.8 million diluted shares outstanding. Now turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q4 was 159.3 million compared to 124.6 million in the same quarter for 2019. Free cash flow was 140.9 million compared to 77.6 million in the same quarter last year, resulting in a 133% conversion of adjusted net income. We ended the quarter with 1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In Q4, DSO was 64-days, the lowest in at least five- years, and compares to 70-days at the end of Q3 2020 and 72-days in the same quarter last year. We are very pleased with this performance and believe we can manage future DSO levels in the upper 60s. Moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended this quarter with approximately 36,700 engineers, designers and consultants, a year-over-year increase of 12.8% and a sequential increase of 8.8%, our highest quarterly increase in the last five-years. Our total headcount for Q4 was more than 41,100 employees, a net addition of more than 3,100 EPAMers from the previous quarter. Utilization was 77.9%, consistent with Q4 of last year and down from 78.2% in Q3 2020. Turning to results for the 2020 full fiscal year. Revenues closed at 2.66 billion or 15.9% reported growth over 2019 and 16% on a constant currency basis. During fiscal 2020, our acquisitions contributed approximately 100 basis points to our growth. GAAP income from operations was 379.3 million, an increase of 25.3% year-over-year and represented 14.3% of revenue. Our non-GAAP income from operations was 472.7 million, an increase of 21.5% over the prior year and represented 17.8% of revenue. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the year came in at 13.6%. Excluding the impact of the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and certain one-time adjustments, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.6%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $5.60. Non-GAAP EPS, which excludes adjustments for stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs and other certain one-time items, was $6.34, reflecting a 17% increase over fiscal 2019 and higher than our pre-pandemic expectations of $6.30. In fiscal 2020, there were approximately 58.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And finally, cash flow from operations was 544.4 million compared to 287.5 million for fiscal 2019. And free cash flow was 475.6 million, reflecting a 128% adjusted net income conversion. Now let’s turn to guidance. Given the relative stability as well as improved visibility across the portfolio, we are resuming our full-year guidance for fiscal 2021. While we anticipate growth patterns across the industry verticals to vary throughout the year, we expect our diversified portfolio to drive growth more in-line with pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, we will be investing at elevated levels across the business to make certain we have sufficient resources to meet renewed demand. Additionally, we will increasingly be investing in new geographies to support our long-term growth. One area of focus in 2021 will be the creation of the infrastructure to support a larger and increasingly global EPAM. Starting with our full-year outlook. Revenue growth will be at least 23% on a reported basis and in constant currency terms will be at least 22% after factoring in a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact. We expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. Our income from operations reflects a higher level of investment in the planned expansion of our capabilities and geographies in 2021. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 12% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.65 to $6.86 for the full-year and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $7.20 to $7.41 for the full-year. We expect weighted average share count of 59 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For Q1 of FY 2021, we expect revenues to be in the range of 757 million to 765 million, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 17% at the midpoint of the range. In Q1, we expect the favorable impact of foreign exchange on revenue growth to be approximately 2%. For the first quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 1% and non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. We anticipate our GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter will be impacted by a higher level of excess tax benefits related to the vesting of restricted stock units in connection to our annual compensation cycle. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.66 to $1.74 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.62 to $1.70 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock compensation expenses is expected to be approximately 86.5 million, with 22.5 million in Q1, 20 million in Q2 and 22 million in the remaining quarters. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately 12.5 million for the year, evenly spread across each quarter. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a 5.5 million loss for the year, with $1 million for Q1 and the balance evenly spread across each remaining quarter. The tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around 21.6 million for the year, with 5.1 million for Q1 and Q2 and 5.7 million in each remaining quarter. And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around 51.5 million for the full-year, with approximately 24.5 million in Q1, 13.5 million in Q2 and 6.8 million in each remaining quarter. In summary, we are pleased with the high-quality results we delivered in fiscal 2020 and are encouraged by what lies ahead in 2021. Operator, let’s open the call up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.
Ramsey El-Assal: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on another strong quarter. Ark, you mentioned that you are seeing some COVID-related - you are still seeing a little COVID-related impact for some of your clients. And I think you said potential longer-term adjustments to certain verticals kind of going forward. I guess the question is, how do you see the post-pandemic sort of business mix for EPAM evolving? Should we start to think about verticals like FI growing a lot faster than some of your other verticals or how should we think about the mix kind of going forward?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Probably when we look at historically, we still have pretty good level volatility on a quarterly basis and even on annual versus across our verticals. And again, we believe that with still with our size, which is definitely growing, this type of volatility depending on one, two, three, four, five large accounts could be still in place. So it is, I think, difficult to say. And if you look at it quarter-by-quarter, it was changing champions practically all the time. So I think in general, it would be something similar at least for this year. And there is unpredictability, but some industries which is the most impacted by COVID might actually start to invest even more like we see in retail, for example, or even travels might start investing more to prepare for common work. So sorry, but difficult to predict.
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. So hard to tell at this point. Okay. And I also wanted to ask about margins and sort of specifically your visibility to margin performance next year. How confident are you that the costs that basically kind of came out of the model in the context of COVID are going to flow back in. I’m thinking of things like travel. I guess the easier way to ask the question is, what would see you sort of outperform margins versus underperform margins next year?
Jason Peterson: Okay. So I think the first thing I would say is that our guide is expected to communicate that we do feel that sort of the middle point of the guided range of 16.5% to 17.5% or 17% is really kind of how we are thinking about the business next year. And if I sort of break it into two components, we expect that SG&A will go up somewhat as a percentage of revenue. So I think we exited the full-year at about 16.4%. I think for the full-year of 2021, you would be looking at something heading towards 17%. And some of that is additional investments in the business, and some of that is the return to some amount of normalcy in spending later in the year. But you can see that there is still some benefit that results from that, because prior to the pandemic, we were running at over 18%. Now from a gross margin standpoint, what we expect is that we will continue to see strong growth as evidenced by our guide on the top-line. We do think that we will continue to make investments in growing the business. That will include traditional sort of headcount additions and all the infrastructure that is required to attract talent and bring talent into the company. But then it also will include an expansion in geographies, Poland, India, Mexico, maybe other places in Latin America and other places in Europe. And so those investments, at least probably in 2021, have a somewhat negative impact on gross margin. With the idea that they are subscale at this point, we need to grow them rapidly. And then as they get closer to scale, they will have more consistent profitability. And so the guide kind of incorporates, again, a somewhat elevated level of SG&A, maybe a slightly lower level of gross margin, again, as we invest in our infrastructure so that we can increasingly become a much larger and, of course, more global company.
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. So that is super helpful. I appreciate it. Thank so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. You may proceed with your question.
David Grossman: Good morning. Thank you. I wonder if I could just follow-up, Jason, on your comment about the geographic diversification. How much of that, if any, is related to some of the unrest in Belarus over the last kind of year, 1.5 years? And can you just remind us about how a new facility or how it ramps you know what is the typical trajectory of gross margin as you ramp a new geography?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. Let me, David, start from Belarus because, yes, definitely, there is some influence on what is happening there, similar like it was very much impacting how we sink in involve diversification on our global delivery events in 2014 around Crimea and kind of Russian-Ukrainian conflict. So then we accelerated our presence in Central, Eastern Europe and India and Latin America. And during this period between 2014 and 2020, we definitely were moving to this direction. And I think we continue to move to this direction. So there are multiple new centers, which we are opening, and there are different cost structures there. So I will pass to Jason to comment on specific.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So as Ark indicated, so we would grow more rapidly naturally in some of these other geographies. But Belarus is part of what we are looking at this point. And we probably will see some employees who may help us stand up operations in Lithuania and may help us grow pull and even further. From a gross margin standpoint, when you start a brand-new facility from scratch, kind of the way we did in Lithuania, initially, you will have very low utilization, you will have additional infrastructure costs that aren’t necessarily carried by rates. But again, those are relatively modest facilities. In the case of Poland, where we are still subscale, it is got somewhat lower levels of profitability than a couple of our at-scale operations like you would find in Belarus and Ukraine. So again, it is a more rapid growth rate in those entities, which have a somewhat lower level of profitability. And then, David, I think, longer term, as we get those countries and those individual delivery centers up to a more appropriate scale, I think you will see an evening out of the profitability and the gross margin.
Arkadiy Dobkin: In general, we expect very similar future, which we experienced like in 2015 and 2016.
David Grossman: And just how long does it to take to get to scale where those margins would look more similar to some of your other geographies?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think, again, there is some slight impact, and also sometimes hard to predict at this point, because you learn on the way. But again, we have much, much more practical points that we have had like five, six years ago. And on top of this, if there is more significant impact on margin that it would come from different tax situation changes across the globe as well, so that might be a bigger impact. But it is completely unpredictable.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So David, as Ark said, it is somewhat difficult to tell. But I think as we work through this fiscal year and into the next fiscal year, I think that is when you kind of get to a more appropriate scale and again, more kind of normalized margin.
David Grossman: I see. And then just looking at the evolution of this industry. I’m just curious, at this point, do you have any better insight into how the workplace for the future is going to evolve our customers? Do you sense that they are getting more comfortable with a more distributed work models so that it would allow you to maybe operate more satellites or just give you access to a broader talent pool in a more fragmented workforce that may not be working in a centralized location? Any insights into kind of how those cost savings get shared with the client or maybe it is just too early at this point, but just curious if you have any updates on how this is evolving.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it is two different questions, like in general, definitely. First of all, like prediction of changes was like multiple years ago. Even internally, we started very specific programs how to establish a much more flexible environment for people and to support high distribution, but not to lose in quality and how to find the right talent like in any locations around the world. And we started this like practically three-years ago here. And COVID become a real accelerator for this source, and we felt probably a little bit more prepared than we expected before. And that is one part of the story. And clearly, client-by-client there are different situation. But for sure, there are more acceptance than it was 12-months ago. And it helps to experiment and kind of to build additional proofs for much more distributed model. That is all happening. On another side, when you are talking about cost factors, it is also has a multiple attributes there because there are simple thinking that which cost will be saved, but you have to invest more in this distributed virtual infrastructure. Sometimes it is increase in wage inflation because acceptance of distributed model becoming bigger, and actually, competition for the talent growing as well. So there are too many moving parts right now to say how it would change the cost model.
David Grossman: Great. Alright. And just if I could just one more in. During the pandemic, you focused more on the top 20. That is where the growth was coming, and maybe you saw more opportunity there. Below the top 20 historically has been a pretty important contributor to your overall growth rate. So I’m just curious, you talked about gaining share in your prepared remarks and some new logo wins of larger clients and gaining wallet share. Should we expect the top 20 - is this the new normal for you in terms of where the growth is coming from or do you expect kind of the same distribution that we saw pre-pandemic returning sometime over the next several months?
Jason Peterson: Yes. I think, David, one of the things that is been interesting about this year is that we have had a number of customers that have bolted right from modest revenue in 1 quarter to being in the top 20 within three or four quarters. And so some of what I think Ark’s talked about in the last couple of quarters where clients are feeling the need to really accelerate their investments and rapidly make the investments that allow them to transform the business, means that they move from being outside the top 20 and almost immediately into the top 20. And I think that does kind of distort the top 20 growth rate. I do think that you will see some growth from some of the larger customers in the top 20 in fiscal year 2021. And at the same time, internally, when we look at the statistics for new logo revenues, in new customer revenues, which are customers that began generating revenue within the last 12-months. We are seeing that those are increasing as a percentage of total revenue. I think that sort of shows up in the concentration metrics, particularly as we move from Q2 to Q3 to Q4 in the 2020 fiscal year.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And I think top 20 is a change in a lot as well, so some companies which come in exactly from below top 20 and becoming one of them, and there are good level of volatility at the top.
David Grossman: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. To start, just a question on kind of when you look ahead to 2021, can you maybe talk about the mix that you are anticipating in terms of revenues from current customers and then from what you anticipate to be new customers over the next 12-months and how that kind of that go-to-market strategy is changing? It seems like you are getting wallet share, and how we should think of that evolution?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So we haven’t traditionally forecasted new customer revenues. Instead, we kind of look at the trends kind of historically. But I think as Ark pointed out at the end is that we are seeing a lot of customers begin their journey with EPAM and very rapidly move into the top 20. And so again, it is interesting, as many of you have noted, is that we are already seeing growth again in our Travel and Hospitality. And it is not because travel has improved, but because there are retailers and consumer goods companies who are making quite significant investments right now to revisit their business while either to expand an existing e-commerce strategy, to create one, to find different ways to connect with customers, to deliver products with customers. So you are seeing a lot of lot of spending in that area. You are seeing a lot of spending in manufacturing, again, with more sort of a digital connection. And so I think you will see growth in some of these customers that are relatively small for us. But we also have a couple of large customers that we are expecting high levels of growth from in 2021.
Surinder Thind: Got it. And then in terms of just the overall feel or client conversations that you are having, it sounds like clients are willing to start embarking on some of the bigger projects. Can you talk a little bit about that or are they trying to bite off things in smaller chunks and you are just trying to seeing a lot of renewal or the follow-on of those projects?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think there are definitely visibility to a number of large programs because I do believe that good number of clients already kind of analyze what did happen and create strategy out of this and actually very aggressively moving in the direction to make sure that they prepare for the next unexpected things which might happen. So I think there are a number of big programs, some of them much better shaped, but some of them will be shaped during the next one or two quarters as well. But from what we are seeing, again, it is a number of big engagement is increasing for us here.
Surinder Thind: That is helpful. And then just final question and related to that, how does, I guess, some of these larger projects or the potential for larger projects impact your visibility and stuff as you kind of look out to 2021? When I kind of look back over the last couple of quarters, you guys have come in well above guidance. I’m assuming part of that is just a faster-than-anticipated recovery. But when you think about the forward guide, how should we think about the visibility into that, and then maybe where you end up in terms of - above that, the 23%?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don’t know if you can share something which you don’t know from our message how we predict it. I think we were comfortable enough to return to our annual guidance cycles. And in kind of big picture, we are doing this very similar like we were doing this pre-COVID. And while there are some bigger program happening, we also become bigger. So it is in some way, very rational from our point of view. So I think, again, our visibility and predictability methods right now very similar to what we were doing like in pre-COVID times.
Surinder Thind: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.
Jason Kupferberg: Hey. Good morning guys. I just wanted to start with kind of a big picture question. We recently did a CIO survey that showed a meaningful decrease in the percentage of enterprises who believe that they are largely done with their digital transformational journey. And we think that is because they just continue to find more parts of their business that can be digitized, so the runway basically keeps getting longer. And I’m just wondering if that is a dynamic you are observing within your client base provide the digital journey kind of continues to get extended as the scope of digital transformation efforts broaden out?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So you are saying that based on your research, most of the clients saying that they are already done with this?
Jason Kupferberg: Well, we are saying there is actually a decline in the percentage of enterprises saying that they are largely done, because the runway is getting longer as they find more areas to digitize, and I’m wondering if you are observing that.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don’t think we do because like - I think it is -.
Jason Peterson: So it is a double negative. So it is a decline in the number that say that they are done.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Oh, decline in - yes okay.
Jason Peterson: Right.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So it is actually broad, I men - okay. I think we see this as well. It is also very difficult to kind of talk about it when asking what it does mean digitizing because this is not a very well-defined area and different clients thinking differently around this. But definitely, cloud migration and modernization, it is a huge change in the last several years. While everybody is talking about it for almost a decade, the real impact as we all see happening during the last several years. And I think COVID is a huge accelerator of all of this. And from this point of view, we definitely see much more interested and much more audience to focus on this, and kind of related to previous questions, which we answered for them too.
Jason Kupferberg: Right, right. Okay. And Jason, can you just tell us a bit about the assumptions you are making for utilization and pricing in the 2021 guidance?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So utilization, I think, is fairly consistent with utilization that we exit with here in Q4. And so we are not expecting a significant uptick in utilization. And we are not expecting unless didn’t come in as expected that we’d see a significant decline. What we are seeing, as Ark indicated, is wage inflation. Historically, I think I have talked about 4% to 5%. Wage inflation in 2020 was probably more in the 5% to 6% range and probably would stay in the5% to 6% range in 2021, and so maybe a somewhat elevated level of wage inflation. And pricing is, again, it is kind of a mixed environment where newer engagements, particularly with the high demand for resources and again the robust demand for the type of work that we do provides some opportunities. But there are probably some existing customers, particularly in still impacted sectors of the economy, who are a little bit less open to the idea of a 2021 rate increase, that are signaling to us that they are more open and quite open to a 2022 rate increase.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay, it makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Maggie Nolan with William Blair. You may proceed with your question.
Margaret Nolan: Thank you. Following up on the build-out of new geographies, can you give us some insight into the decision process behind what geographies you chose to build out, why you picked those locations and then your assessment of your ability to attract talent in those markets?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Definitely, There is some preparation for this. And for those who are wishing us for - since IPO days like you remember that we were very heavily concentrated practically in a couple of countries. And while we still have consideration in these countries, right now, it is much, much smaller portion of this, so which we prove that we can do it and can scale in different locations. And right now, we are looking at a second kind of degree of geographies, which is not necessarily very new for the global market, but might be relatively new for us. And that includes like our acceleration, for example, in India, our acceleration in Latin America. But also in a number of countries across our traditional locations. And again, the criteria usually, there is IT infrastructure there. There are some talent which was built out, attracted by competitors, but also the quality of university system. In some situation, when there is a kind of natural migration due to geopolitical situation, we select in some countries which would be much more comfortable for people as they decided to relocate as well. And partially 2020 was kind of a combination of these two things.
Margaret Nolan: Got it thank you. And then if we take a look at some of your client buckets, the top 20, there was good growth there, maybe with the exception of the slight sequential decline in the top 5. So any comments on what is going on there? And then when you think about the outside of the top 10, last year, that was a nice growth driver for the Company. This year, it is trailed a little bit kind of the consolidated company growth. So is there any dynamics there that we should be aware of or any thoughts about how to kind of reinvigorate that client relationship, those client relationships in that bucket as you navigate the recovery from COVID?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So that is fair. So I think that we still think about the business very much as a diversified portfolio, whether we are looking at industry verticals or customers. And I think Ark said it at the very beginning of the call, which is, it is a little bit hard to predict which customer is going to drive the growth with absolute certainty in a given fiscal year. We certainly are seeing some customers in the top 20 that we think are still going to have high levels of growth. We are seeing a few that are going to slow down. One thing I could call out is that we have had very high growth with large customers in the business information media space. We continue to have very significant relationships with a number of those clients who are now very much in our top 10. We think that we might not see as much growth in fiscal year 2021 certainly as we saw in 2020. We have got growth coming from some new manufacturing customers. We have got some growth coming from some IT customers with more of a health care flavor to them. And so again, I think you are going to see a little bit more of a return to the EPAM traditional growth rate in the below 20, but it may not be quite the way it was three or four-years ago because I do think as we continue to have established relationships with large companies and are seen as that as a vendor that can get things done inside those companies, you do get growth inside those portfolios.
Margaret Nolan: Alright. Thanks Jason and thanks Ark.
Jason Peterson: Hey thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. You may proceed with your question.
Bryan Bergin: Hey guys good morning. Question on hiring here. You added a significant 3,000 billable headcount in the quarter. How do you feel the model operated as you have on-boarded here the last couple of months? Did you feel like you are nearer ceiling level to comfortably add? And how should we be thinking about the pace of headcount expansion in early 2021 before you scale some of these newer regions?
Jason Peterson: So clearly, we have invested in our capability or our capacity to add additional headcount. And so as we get bigger, as we make those investments, we talk about this is the biggest incremental growth that we have had in the history of the company. But clearly, we are putting in place a structure that allows us to continue to do that. But clearly, Q4, we are kind of catching up from Q2 and Q3. And so right now, we might not have as much headcount growth expected as we, for instance, enter Q1. But again, we are running at a hotter level than we have in past years, in part because we are seeing that the demand is very strong and we are putting an infrastructure in place that allows us to meet that demand.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think very often the challenge is not just to grow, but actually to grow responsibly to make sure that you keep in balance between demand and supply. And this is almost like a through those stuff. Form this point of view, that is one of the key kind of challenges which we try to navigate.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. I guess following on that, can you comment on the cash position and M&A receptiveness you know how are you thinking about M&A as a component of the geographic expansion?
Jason Peterson: Right. So I talked about this, I think, every quarter, and I’m going to add something to what I have said in the past. So the M&A pipeline, quite active in our discussions with potential acquisition targets. And at this point, we are quite advanced in our discussions with several companies. And so I do expect that we will be talking more about that in the not-too-distant future. We continue to have a focus on capabilities. But also, geography would probably play a role as well. And the focus might be on helping us with kind of end markets, so again, more customer facing. But in some cases, we may use an acquisition to get us an established position and a management team in a country that we don’t have as much experience in. So I think you will kind of see both of those things in 2021.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. You may proceed with your question.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. good morning Ark, good morning Jason. Ark, Jason, good quarter here. My first question is, you have mentioned a couple of times larger and increasingly global TAM. And you provided a lot of detail on that from a delivery perspective. My question is from a revenue perspective, if you can provide specifics with regards to how you are thinking about future globalization of the EPAM footprint from a revenue perspective? You continue to have the vast majority of our revenues come from North America and Europe, any thoughts on diversification? And Jason, your comments on M&A, is that more of a geography focus or capability focus?
Jason Peterson: I will answer first, and I’m sure Ark have something to say as well here. So I think in some cases, the market investment that is more customer focusing may still be in places like Western Europe. I think in terms of longer-term expansion, I do think that APAC continues to be an opportunity for the company. As you know, most of the revenue does out of Western Europe and North America. And we still are, I would say, underpenetrated in Asia Pac. So longer term, I think that is definitely an opportunity. I think you are beginning to see slightly elevated growth rates in APAC. And I think that, particularly, there is interesting opportunities in the Singapore market. And so I think kind of longer term, I think you will see greater revenue. But I’m not necessarily expecting that to show up in a material way in 2021, but more kind of in future years.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. I think from general direction, North America and Western Europe is by far the main priority. The rest of the markets, which Jason mentioned, priority is how to serve our global clients in these markets and establish ourselves a little bit better. And that is what was happening during the last probably seven, eight-years when we came to China because of UBS, for example, and starting to expand. So I think it would be growth in APAC even with some local clients, but again, it is not going to be really significant. But the growth with the global clients, which we serve in North America, Western Europe and extension to different markets from APAC, to potentially Latin America is, well, very much anticipated. And with our size, we have almost unlimited opportunity in the markets where we are.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Understood. That is good to know. Ordinarily, I wouldn’t pull out a specific acquisition that you did, but I always thought that the Continuum acquisition with integrated consulting, that was key capability set that you guys added. I was curious if you could shed more light on how that performed through the course of 2020, particularly given - was it was it more that the discretionary nature perhaps of that was impacted or was it that clients look to you to adapt more so? So if you can talk how you see that evolve and how you see that affecting your future investments?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. I think we try to illustrate today with a couple of examples. But in general, it is definitely in my material statement, say, it is a journey and we did a number of acquisitions to build experienced consultancy capabilities. We build in business consultancy capabilities at this point organically. And we do believe that we have a very good foundation for technology consulting capabilities. And the more important for us, how to bring them all together and create, in some way, the Continuum of offering linking these to engineering. That is why, like in the past, we stated multiple times that we are not even looking on specific line of service and consulting to separate from our traditional engineering, but actually the real strong point and from this point of view, I think during the last two years, we saw a very positive impact. And I think 2020, to our surprise, being such a range in difficult year, actually triggered multiple wins where we entered new clients through very different point for us from the past and in return started much more significant programs for ourselves with a big potential. And also, we had a couple of wins against top consulting firms in the world, which making us kind of much more comfortable thinking about the direction which you selected. So there are very good signs that it is moving forward well right now.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over - our next question comes from Arvind Ramnani with Piper Sandler. You may proceed with your question.
Arvind Ramnani: Great. Hey congrats on another terrific quarter. The demand environment seems quite robust across your portfolio. Are you seeing pricing strength as the overall demand environment improves?
Jason Peterson: Yes. I think there are opportunities with some of the newer engagements. And particularly, you are right, when there is strong demand and supply is a little bit more challenged, that produces opportunities. But I think with some of the long-standing relationships, it is a little bit more mixed, right. It kind of depends on where they are in terms of their own demand, and a lot of people still have some uncertainty. And so we still see pricing opportunity. But maybe a little bit cautious on the ability to tick up rates as frequently as we have in the past. And that is important kind of what informs the guidance with the midpoint of that range being 17% adjusted IFO.
Arvind Ramnani: Great. Great. And I had a question operationally, how are you thinking about staffing in a post-pandemic environment? Clearly, last year, there were probably kind of fewer vacations and high levels of productivity. But when you look at the next 12-months to 18-months, there could be like elevated levels of vacation and time off and things of that sort. Are you kind of anticipating planning sort of your staffing levels to account for some of this?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. Thank you. It is a very, very interesting question, which triggered a lot of internal debates. Like on our management calls, we discussed it, the executive team going for vacation for 6 months or nine-months after this. But in general, we definitely put in the model a lot of source, and we are projecting accelerated vacations, assuming that COVID really will give up more than we are seeing right now. But yes, it is one of the moving parts right now. But our current model anticipated some increased vacations afterwards [indiscernible] will be done.
Arvind Ramnani: Great, terrific. Thank you and good luck for 2021.
Jason Peterson: Thank you. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Arkadiy Dobkin for any closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. Thank you. Thank you, everybody, for attending. Again, we all know how tough was 2020. And we really hope that 2021 will be different year while we all understand that it will be a mix of different things. We are looking positively to overall situation. And hopefully, our next quarter will be different from the second quarter update last year where completely have to change the whole picture. So hopefully, it will be different this year. Thank you very much, and talk to you next time.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the EPAM Systems' Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.
David Straube - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter of fiscal 2020 results. If you have not, a copy is available in the Investor section on epam.com. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investor section of our website. With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. For Q3, we delivered solid results, with revenue of $652 million, an approximate 11% year-over-year growth in reported terms. And non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.65, which represents almost 19% growth from the same quarter in 2019. Before providing more specific color on our Q3 performance, I would like to return to November 2019 when we had our Investor Day in Boston and shared our aspirational goals for EPAM 2021. It seems like it was many lifetimes apart, but I thought it's worth to remind that the goal we shared with you then was to continuously transfer EPAM into an adaptive enterprise with ability to adapt to people, platforms and processes into those that quickly respond to change, build and bring to life the digital platform that connect our people to work seamlessly and enable us to be efficient and effective in all what we do. Extend our leadership across integrated consulting engineering, open opportunities for transformation for everybody anywhere through next gen delivery, educational, social, and innovation programs. Obviously we started the journey of corporate adaptability long before our meeting in Boston. But in March of this year, we found ourselves very unexpectedly in completely new situation, which first forced us to forget about our aspirations and then very quickly to apply all we could to address the very urgent and significant changes in realities in business for us and for our clients. The circumstances later become even more challenging with the increase of social and political turbulence across multiple geographies we operate in. During that time, to our surprise, we recognized that we were better prepared than we initially thought. And at the same time, we realized that many of the things we had planned to do before the global crisis still needed to be done, but at much faster pace. So with that reminder, let me come back to our Q3 result and highlight several things. At this point, we can say that overall demand for our services in Q3 is more in line with Q1 of this year, our last pre-COVID quarter. While the structure of the revenue is visibly changed, some industries and specific companies are very much damaged from demand standpoint and most likely will continue to be under pressure for a relatively long time in the future. Some might not survive. On another hand, other industries and companies are motivated to significantly accelerate their own drive to become adaptive enterprises itself and to be better prepared for the next unexpected change whatever it is. We see such trends strongly enough within our current client portfolio and across new clients who started to work with us during the last several months and most in very much urgent manner. So in result, we continue to invest strategically in our key priorities as we said it in November 2019, which include integrated consulting called EPAM Continuum direction, cloud-enabled business transformation efforts, and data and (00:05:12) capabilities. In other words, strengthen our traditional engineering DNA direction. And all that while we're thinking the practical applicability of more flexible and much more distributed ways to deliver. Or in more traditional terms, the future of our work and talent approach, empowered by our digital talent productivity knowledge and educational platforms which we're also extending into direct offering to our clients or what we call inclusively our EPAM Anywhere direction. In addition, we're investing in broader diversified and more (00:05:54) strategy across the globe to make sure we have many quality growth hubs for the future. We believe that this investment along with overall expanded R&D programs will continue to positively differentiate us further in continued evolving and competitive environment in which we not only compete with global technology services companies unlike (00:06:18) global system integrators, but also (00:06:21) brand name consultancies. Our focus on becoming an adaptive organization has made it a critical requirement for us to review the majority of our engagements and identify ways in which we can become much more customer centric. We believe that our efforts to zero in on our customer value have created some new opportunities to expand our traditional engagement model and to help our customers to accelerate their digital programs, or in some cases, the adoption of new models of working and new models of engagement. Couple examples to illustrate. One of our largest privately held family owned spirit company in the world, EPAM helped transform their digital marketing platform allowing them the ability to expand their digital footprint and deliver innovative connected experiences to consumers while keeping cost under control. With more than 150 websites and 2,500 web domains, we improve brand consistency and perception while accelerating time to market and delivering significant operational cost saving. And we really could not have done this without a clear collaboration model around the customer, especially given the massive shift to work from home while still expected overall market growth in that segment. Another interesting example is the work we started just several months ago for a global leader of health information technology services, devices and hardware whose products are used at tens of thousands of medical facilities around the world. Their goal was to radically reimagine the role they plan (00:08:01), evolving from providing the system of (00:08:04) to support in actual health outcomes. Our efforts there are underway and we exercise on our new capabilities in consulting (00:08:14) technology and cloud architecture, delivery scale and productivity, and creating a new template of how we engage with customers from zero to full transformational program at a different speed. With that, our expectation for Q4 indicate that we will have a sizable sequential step up in our revenue growth, which could be one of our highest during the last several years. We plan to focus on the sustainability of those rate of growth as well as doing the (00:08:45) demand and supply in balanced and measured way in our high levels of delivery and quality. All, while keeping an eye on the very dynamic environment, which continues to be impacted daily with the global health crisis, social unrest, and economic anxieties. So we understand too well that while the second half of 2020 is shaping up to be better than our initial expectation, we are not at all out of the woods at this point and 2021 is still difficult to predict. As we look forward, we continue to navigate the current challenges while protecting our people, guarding our financial position, and investing in our core capabilities, platforms, and on energy efforts. All that to support our adaptive attributes (00:09:37) We strongly believe our position as the leading provider of digital product and platform engineering services combined with our maturing consulting experience is our key differentiator. We are confident in our ability to come out of this challenging time and (00:09:56) result driven company that will continue growing in the post-pandemic environment at 20-plus percent growth rate. And I think it's the right moment to mention that just a few days ago, Fortune magazine published their 100 Fastest Growing Companies list for 2020, and included EPAM in it for the third time and second consecutive with 21st overall ranking and is number one in information technology service category. Now, let me hand the call over to Jason.
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Thank you, Ark. And good morning, everyone. We delivered very solid results in Q3 with better than expected revenue growth combined with strong profitability and cash flow generation. In the third quarter, revenue came in at $652.2 million, a year-over-year increase of 10.9% on a reported basis and 10% in constant currency terms, reflecting a positive foreign exchange impact of approximately 1%. Revenue for the quarter was higher than our previously guided range due to a solid demand environment combined with stronger hiring as well as greater than expected availability across our delivery organization resulting in higher billable utilization. As Ark mentioned, the broad drivers of activity in our end markets remain unchanged. Our customers are modernizing and moving their applications to the cloud, advancing their digital transformation agendas, and in many cases, building the frameworks and tools needed to drive deeper insights from the volume of data they generate, allowing for better business decision making. Looking at Q3 industry vertical performance, Business Information & Media delivered very strong results, 32.3% growth in the quarter and continues to be our largest industry vertical. Life Sciences & Healthcare grew 11.1%. Software & Hi-tech grew 9.7% in the quarter. Financial Services grew 4.9% in Q3. Growth in the quarter was impacted in part by the expected ramp down of the European banking client. Excluding this client, growth in Financial Services was 12.3%. Travel & Consumer declined 2% in the quarter. Growth in this vertical was impacted by a decline in travel and to a lesser extent retail, partially offset by growth across a number of consumer branded goods customers. And our Emerging vertical delivered 12.12% growth driven by clients in telecommunications, automotive and manufacturing offset by a slowdown in the energy sector. The variability in growth across industry verticals is driven in part by certain of our customers working through end market disruptions related to COVID-19. However, we are encouraged by the early signs of improved demand from many of our customers as they make investments in response to the changing business environment. From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region representing 59.8% of our Q3 revenues, grew 8.8% year-over-year or 8.6% in constant currency. Europe representing 32.9% of our Q3 revenues grew 13.3% year-over-year or 8.6% in constant currency. CIS representing 4.6% of our Q3 revenues grew 13.4% year-over-year and 30.9% in constant currency. Growth in the CIS region was driven primarily by clients in financial services and mining. And finally APAC grew 27.4% year-over-year or 25.6% in constant currency terms and now represents 2.7% of our revenues. In the third quarter growth in our top 20 clients was 17.8% and growth outside our top 20 clients was 6.2% year-over-year. Sequential growth for clients outside of our top 20 was 4.9%, substantially higher than sequential growth achieved by our top 20 clients. We were pleased to see a higher level of contribution in the quarter coming from new logos and a number of clients outside our top 20. Moving down the income statement. I should first note that we continue to run the business with a cost basis that is lower than our usual levels. While the lower cost basis is driven by operational efficiencies we have delivered across the business, there are also temporary contributors, including reduced travel, relocations and certain administrative expenses, producing lower levels of SG&A spend over the last two quarters. Looking forward, we expect a higher level of cost in a post-pandemic environment, but anticipate that some of the efficiency benefits could be maintained longer-term. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35.1%, compared to 35.8% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 36.8%, compared to 37.1% for the same quarter last year. Gross margin in the quarter was impacted by the continued effect of COVID-19 concessions, partially offset by higher utilization and benefit from foreign exchange. GAAP SG&A was 17.9% of revenue compared to 20.2% in Q3 of last year. And non-GAAP SG&A came in at 15.9% of revenue, compared to 18.7% in the same period last year. Similar to last quarter, the reduced SG&A levels in the quarter were substantially driven by a lower level of activity-related relocations, travel and marketing events and other administrative-related expenses. GAAP income from operations was $96.4 million or 14.8% of revenue in the quarter, compared to $80.6 million or 13.7% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $123.3 million or 18.9% of revenue in the quarter compared to $99.7 million or 17% of revenue in Q3 last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 14% which includes a greater than expected level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate which excludes excess tax benefits was 22.6%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.53. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.65 reflecting an 18.7% increase over the same quarter in fiscal 2019. In Q3, there were approximately 58.6 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q3 was $175.6 million, compared to $119 million in the same quarter for 2019. Free cash flow was $165.8 million, compared to $91.8 million in the same quarter last year, resulting in 171.5% conversion of adjusted net income. Our continued focus on operational efficiency around invoicing and cash collection, in addition to lower CapEx spending given the current environment led to (00:17:05) strong cash generation in the quarter. EPAM ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and available borrowing capacity made up of $1.16 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $60 million in short-term investments and $275 million available on our revolver. DSO was a record 70 days, compared to 73 days at the end of Q2 2020 and 75 days in the same quarter last year. Moving on to a few operational metrics. With a low level of attrition combined with active hiring, we were able to add more than 1,500 EPAMers to the company. Demand of new hires in Q3 is only slightly below our fiscal 2019 quarterly average. We continue to run our recruiting engine at high levels of efficiency as we ramp up our hiring efforts. We ended the quarter with approximately 33,750 engineers, designers and consultants, a 7.4% increase year-over-year. Our total head count for Q3 was more than 38,000 employees. Utilization was 78.2%, compared to 76.1% in the same quarter last year and down from 83.9% in Q2 2020. Now, let's turn to guidance. As we mentioned earlier in the call, as companies continue to focus on modernization and respond to changes in the economic environment, this drives demand for our business. In response to this demand, we are increasing hiring but continue to expect EPAM to run with lower than normal SG&A expenditures. As a result, we expect Q4 to deliver strong sequential revenue growth at elevated levels of profitability. For Q4, we expect revenues to be in the range of $695 million to $705 million producing a year-over-year growth rate of 10.6% at the midpoint in the range. In Q4, we expect the impact of FX on revenue growth to be negligible. For the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 14% to 15% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 17.5% to 18.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 15% and non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.44 to $1.54 for the quarter, and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.63 to $1.73 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 58.9 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for Q4. Stock compensation expense is expected to be approximately $19.5 million. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is expected to be approximately $3.1 million. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $3 million loss for the quarter. Tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $5.4 million, and we expect excess tax benefits to be around $8.4 million. We are pleased with the outcome of our Q3 results and are encouraged by what is shaping up to be a strong finish to fiscal 2020. I would like to thank our employees across the globe for their hard work and dedication to EPAM's continued success. Operator, let's open the call for questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open.
Bryan C. Bergin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thank you. Hope you're all well. Just wanted to gauge a bit here on outlook as we move past 2020. Is there any color you can give on growth recovery trajectory and specific to some of the industries you mentioned, the large European financial service client? Is that wind down complete and/or the travel and consumer clients are they at the base level of what you think you could start growing again?
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Let me start with, I guess, maybe the more tactical question. So, in terms of the, I guess, the wind down of the European banking client, that substantially happened in Q2. It shows up in Q3, which means it will also show up in Q4 and Q1 and a negative impact on Financial Services' growth rates. From a demand standpoint, and I don't think we would comment on beyond 2020, but what I would is comment on demand overall and what we do continue to see is obviously travel is quite negatively impacted. Energy is still negative with the low energy prices in the market. And then, if you're in the large physical audience kind of event space, all those businesses are also impacted. Other than that though, what we feel we're seeing is very strong demand across a broad range of industries and even some of the retail and consumer goods companies who may have paused investment in Q2 clearly are beginning to sort of accelerate investments to respond to the changing business conditions. Who knows what will happen if there's another round of COVID, economic shutdowns and everything. But right now, the demand is quite strong.
Bryan C. Bergin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. It's good to hear. And then, just as far as the civil unrest in Belarus, can you just give us an update on the operational contingencies you have? Anything you can provide from the ground there and how you're mitigating risks and anything we need to consider as far as client risk associated with this situation?
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: In very short for the last three months, we have probably less than half of day some interruption in connectivity. And it was already more than two months ago. Since then, infrastructure and general working conditions environment were pretty much stable in line with norm and we definitely have a lot of experience of monitoring and kind of seeing what's happening based on my experience of 2014 when situation escalated between Ukraine and Russia. So, really built very detailed BCP plans then. We were using them, adjusting them. To a specific situation in Belarus and again monitoring this daily and so far practically zero impact on our operations.
Bryan C. Bergin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.
David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. I wonder if I could just go back to the question that was just asked just about kind of how the business is trending. And, Jason, you gave a good description of where you're seeing relative strength versus the areas of relative weakness. If we look at the guidance for the fourth quarter, on a year-over-year basis, it's very similar to what you saw in the September quarter. But like, again, sequentially, I think you're back to more normalized levels of sequential growth that you would experience in the December quarter. So, is it fair to say when you kind of balance the issues with demand as well as capacity, if you will, that we should return, everything else being equal, to more normalized sequential patterns of growth as we enter next year or is it just too early to call something like that?
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Yeah. I guess the one thing I would say is that as we talked about we've got subsection of the industry verticals that are continuing to be impacted. When I first – when we talked about in Q2 we said about a third of our customer revenues were in industries that were impacted by end customer demand. And I would say at this time in Q3, it's more like 20%. And so you're clearly seeing an improving environment. The one thing I think is important, David, is usually we would be having net additions of between 1,000 and 2,000 employees per quarter. And in Q2, we didn't hire that much and we had attrition. And so we actually had a decline in productive head count of 800 people. And so, we're still kind of behind on the availability of talent. And right now, we're back in a scenario where demand certainly exceeds supply. And it takes a few quarters for us to kind of get back to the point where we can sort of match up supply fully with available demand. We did hire faster than we expected in Q3 and that contributed with 1,500 net production head count additions. And then from a Q4 standpoint, based on the demand that we're seeing, we're expecting to add over 2,000 productive staff and that would be the highest rate of head count growth that we've seen in the history of the company. So I think it just takes us a little bit of time to sort of build back up the productive capacity to allow for those higher rates of annualized growth.
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: But, David, I will say that still 2021 is not very clear and as you see like we – like the first – this is the first time COVID hit everybody. Who knows what will be happening (00:26:56-00:27:03) so have to keep this in mind.
David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right, right. But it sounds like at least for the moment, you're still operating in an environment where the demand – the rebound in demand is exceeding supply right now. Are you still – your revenue growth at least for the moment is till constrained by supplies, is that a fair statement?
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: That's nothing new here. So we're also balancing between these two, so as you know.
David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right, right.
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: So this is a – again, yes, it look more like normal, but with couple (00:27:38) Jason mentioned when you have to hold the machines and you need like to take time to go back and we're coming back pretty fast right now.
David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. And just I think you also made a comment in your prepared remarks about some of the efficiencies on the expense side while some are temporary as a result of travel and all these other things going on in the business right now. Can you help us maybe unpack a little bit what – how we should interpret that about some of these efficiencies being more enduring? And in that response maybe you can weave in how your clients are thinking about a more sustained work from home model even it's not 100% of your business, but how are they thinking about work from home going forward and how is that getting priced in to these relationships going forward?
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: I'll try to give you the tactical on the SG&A costs and what Ark said or talked more around what we're seeing from a client standpoint. So, the last two quarters we've been around 16% of SG&A as a percentage of revenue. You'll remember probably I guess last year I was talking about SG&A in the range of 18% to 19%. I don't think that I will be talking about 19% anytime soon, but I do think that 16% is obviously too low. And even as we look ahead to Q4, I would expect that SG&A would head towards 17% of revenue. You clearly continue to have limited travel, pretty much no travel in the SG&A side. We haven't added facilities as rapidly as we would have under usual conditions. We've got some administrative benefits. We're not doing marketing events. Investor conferences are done virtually. And so, I don't know what happens in the future, right? But I do suspect that there will continue to be savings as long as we're in this, sort of, deep COVID, no travel, no physical – coming together environment. And so, for as long as you think that goes on, I think you continue to see some pretty solid SG&A savings. And then in the future, I think that we are definitely seeing that there's opportunities, let's say, around the margin to run somewhat more efficiently, maybe from a supply and demand matching and then in a few areas in terms of our corporate functions. And so, it's too early for me to, sort of, say what profitability could look like in the future. But I'm somewhat hopeful that there's some opportunities for efficiency. I don't know if Ark...
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Yeah. And in general, work from home or this new way of work and, I think, it's very difficult to add anything new to what everybody talking about. Clearly the COVID pushed everybody, kind of, really forward. I don't know for how many years, from acceptance, what it could be. And I don't think it would go back completely to what it was just nine months ago. So, I'm pretty sure that acceptance is different trend. If it would be like for couple months testing, but it's already close to a year and probably will be much more than a year. I'm pretty sure going to stay for long and the models will be changing. The level of distribution on the project would be much more accepted and different approaches to securities will be there as well, so.
David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, contract terms and conditions from a pricing standpoint haven't really been approached yet, as it relates to, kind of, how much work is being done from home sales force?
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: No. Not at this time, David.
David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Great. All right, guys. Thanks very much.
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Ashwin Vassant Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Congratulations, guys. Good quarter. And the commentary seems positive. I want to delve deeper into the – you say demand is very strong, I believe, Jason, you used those words. The attributes of that, if you can talk about this conversations and pipeline, the conversion to project, the decision making pace, contract size, overall pricing, things like that? If you can get bit more granular and talk about those things as it sets up for the future.
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: I think we tried to bring some color already to this and there are a number of plans which is new logos, which went pretty fast and there are some new programs. But it's actually all over the spectrum right now. There is some vendor consolidations. There are some slowdowns. I think, in general, it feels that it's much, much closer in overall to what we felt like in normal time, okay? So, I don't know if I can say that it's completely changed, but you'll feel more pressure and more speed from some clients.
Ashwin Vassant Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Understood.
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: I mean...
Ashwin Vassant Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah, yeah. Go ahead. Sorry.
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: ...really, there seems to be a – that Ark just said, you know what, increased sort of – an acceleration of kind of focus on modernization. And so, you do have a series of customers that really do seem to have accelerated the pace of their journey. I think Ark in his prepared remarks talked about the high-tech IT software company focused on the healthcare space. And that was one of the companies that we talked about, I believe, in Q2 where the relationship had been established actually during the COVID times when they couldn't meet face-to-face and they couldn't visit our delivery centers. And that relationship is developing very nicely and they're likely to head towards our top 20 very quickly. Certain relationships are establishing and accelerating very, very quickly. And then, again, other clients just continue to sort of move along on their agendas. But, yeah, I think you've seen the industry vertical. We continue to have strong growth in the BIM space. Insurance continues to be an area where we see accelerated demand. We expect to see strong growth in healthcare and life sciences in Q4 and beyond. And then, solid growth in the high tech and IT or high-tech software portion of our portfolio.
Ashwin Vassant Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay.
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: I think the difference...
Ashwin Vassant Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Go ahead.
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: ...sorry, I think the difference is like normal from our standpoint that everybody understands it. Like before, it was much more longer term, right now like you feel that it could change based on what's happening. And like when we thought like three months that COVID probably going to be down, now that is going up and what would be the action on this. So there is some question in there all the time.
Ashwin Vassant Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Understood. Yeah. The other question was on cash flow and your balance sheet, obviously, a good solid quarter with regards to the cash flow performance. Where there any pull forwards or any quirkiness because of the environment? And then, with the balance sheet I believe this may be the first time you have over $1 billion in cash. What's the cash usage or capital allocation strategy you're thinking of? Are you more likely to look for bigger acquisitions, something more transformational, or just continue with your current philosophy?
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Yeah. So the only onetime-ish item that I can think of is that, we – obviously your CapEx has slowed down somewhat as you're not building out facilities and some of those things to support head count growth. And so, you've had a slowdown in your CapEx, but really it's driven by the strong profitability and the significant improvement in DSO, which is down to 70 days. And so that's what's driven most of the cash generation. From the standpoint of kind of what we're going to do with the cash or how we're thinking about it, we still focus on the inorganic strategy. The valuation of opportunities continues to be active. And I do expect you'll see us announce some things over the next couple quarters. And again, generally on the smaller side, but I think there's definitely some opportunity to do something somewhat larger than we've done in the past. Again, it will always be carefully evaluated and we'll be prudent in our decision-making. But it could be somewhat larger than deals you've seen in the past years.
Ashwin Vassant Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thank you, guys.
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Jonathan Y. Lee - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. This is Jonathan, on for James. Thanks for taking my question. How are you thinking about the recent shut downs across Europe? Have clients expressed concern or delays around decision making because of it? And does 4Q guidance contemplate any impact?
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Yeah. So, impact of potential shut downs or shut downs in Europe on demand and client (00:37:54).
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: We didn't see any specific correlation yet. So, again, clearly, like I just mentioned couple minutes ago, the question seems there (00:38:09) at the same time, it's very different than it was March, April when nobody knew how it's going to work. Right now, it's everybody much more comfortable. So, no impact which we see. So, it's everything similar to what we saw like months ago, two months ago, the directions there. But again the question, what impact will be in another month or two? Like seeing yesterday US numbers were 100,000 people exiting (00:38:43). What would be the next? Who knows. No impact so far.
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: I would say that our guidance has tried to be thoughtful in terms of potential furloughs on the part of clients maybe in the month of December that we might not know about at this time and also whether or not we could have any sort of productive decline (00:39:02) so we've tried to take that into consideration. But as Ark said, we haven't seen any impact on decision making in Europe at this time.
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: But in general, from work environment like everybody really comfortable working from home and distributed through, like, again I'm – I know that I'm saying what everybody else is saying, so that's nothing different here.
Jonathan Y. Lee - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful. And we continue to hear about vendor consolidation across the broader IT services space and I think you mentioned that in some of your prepared remarks. Can you elaborate on some of the competitive environment and dynamics particularly against some of the larger systems integrators and consultancies?
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: So, we don't have any specific numbers to share, but generally that didn't (00:40:03) happen because like when the hit happened in Q2, a lot of companies were reviewing their vendor lists and some of the vendors were definitely benefiting from this. We were benefiting in multiple clients as well. So, that's happening and continuing to happen.
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: And I would say that not only has our brand been improving, but also just the reliability of our delivery in Q2 and Q3 during the more challenging times in COVID. We definitely had some wins from vendor consolidation in that standpoint. So, some of our competitors inside the clients had more trouble or let's say more challenges and that gave us some opportunity to pick up some business in those accounts.
Jonathan Y. Lee - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very helpful. Congrats on the quarter, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.
Ramsey El-Assal - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks so much for taking my question today. I wanted to ask about the relative contribution to growth of kind of cross-sell versus new logo signings and where that balance today stands maybe relative to before the pandemic, and also which one's more critical as we head into next year?
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: So the simple answer would be as always like both of them very important. And traditionally, we're benefiting from growing with existing clients. And I think the level of kind of the structure for our client portfolio still allow us to grow a lot from existing brands and cross-sell. At the same time, we mentioned one case already today a couple times when we have new logo growing extremely fast with us and we've seen this as a real opportunity to diversify more. But cross-sell is extremely important. And when we're talking about digital, consulting, traditional engineering, we've seen more and more clients where we entered door from one side and basically very quickly bringing the kind of services which (00:42:31) figuring another side of the capabilities again. So, that's happening much more than before.
Ramsey El-Assal - Barclays Capital, Inc.: It's happening more than before, okay. And then headed into – well, okay, that's perfect. And then I also wanted to ask, just in general, can you update us on the sort of talent environment in the context of the pandemic? Are things normalizing a bit? How is attrition and some of the key metrics that you track? And just your general comments there would be appreciated.
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: So, general comment also not changing in this – to answering this question because it's pretty consistent for the last eight years. Talent is very critical. There is huge competition for this. And I think with all that's happened even in Q2 and since the crisis started, it really didn't impact the pressure (00:43:31-00:43:36). Because if you think about as a pressure, was going like to more distribution, to more work from home, to more push on outside of the place where you are, and in general like a lot of companies had to reach out to additional vendors. So expanding the locations globally to become easier. At the same time, we talked last year many times about educational, about trainings and all of this, and this is becoming even more important part of our operation. We tried to (00:44:19) November 2019 when we met in Boston and it was a big part of our presentation as well. Actually very serious advances in this area during the last 12 months for us as well. So we're trying to have much more control as I say.
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Ark commented on the, I guess, the demand for talent. I'll just comment on some of the internal metrics. The attrition within the company has continued to decline, clearly focused on the safety and well-being of employees, but also focused on making certain that employees remain kind of committed to the journey here at EPAM. So, we actually completed our annual promotion campaign. And so, for the whole company and we've already done that this year. That impact of annual compensation increases is actually fully embedded in the Q3 results. So we try to make certain that as we see improving demand that we're making certain that we're supporting our employee base. And I think a number of the other things we've done including, Ark and others leadership has contributed to actually a decline in attrition rather than an increase.
Ramsey El-Assal - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. I appreciate your answers. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is open.
James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Ark, in your prepared remarks you talked about changes in engagement. You gave the example of the spirit company and the healthcare client. I was wondering though if you could elaborate on that a bit. Is that the way that you're engaging the customer, the way that the customer engages their customers, both? Any perspective on that would be helpful.
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: I think perspective in general very simple. And again, don't think its eye opening, but if you think what's happened six, nine months ago, with COVID that some companies which were thinking that they are very much on the right place with their digital transformation programs, started to find out that actually what was done during the previous couple years should be very quickly done. And some companies which were postponing the programs realized very quickly that they have to actually jump in as well if, again, business allowed, if financing allowed to do it. From this point of view, both examples exactly illustrate this point. For the first one, they put a lot there already but then realized that the whole digital ecosystem should be very different with this. I don't know, 5, 10 years jump in the future. And the second one really probably felt a pressure to do it immediately and probably were waiting for maybe a year, maybe two, maybe three before and now jumping very quickly to this trend. And I think that's true across different vendors. While again, the general picture, the whole demand is still impacted by some industries and companies which is in a very unfortunate situation right now.
James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Ark, you also said that you felt that the Q – I thought you said that the Q4 could be among your highest growth. I apologize if I misheard that but that seemed important, so what's that... (00:48:08)
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: What we meant that sequential gross Q4 versus Q3...
James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got you.
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: ...looks right now is one of the highest during the last probably two, three years.
James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: That makes sense.
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: This is sequential growth. Okay? But we also need to understand the whole dynamic because you cannot compare this to a normal year because we went down and then we're going up from different situations.
James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: And then the last thing, you also said that some companies may not survive. So that sounds important too. What do you think? What's that about?
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: I think as we have pretty general knowledge and some company (00:49:00) and some companies in very specific markets definitely under huge pressure, like, if you're talking about some companies which are very tied to the physical space. Who knows how long they will be able to handle the kind of COVID situation. And again our understanding about five and six months ago and now very different again. I'm pretty sure six months ago (00:49:32) number of predictions that it will be much longer, but we as a human being were hoping for the best. And now we're in this reality that nobody can say it's another 6 months or another 18 months.
James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Jason Kupferberg - BofA Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Guys, I wanted to follow up with another margin question. I thought the SG&A commentary you gave was very helpful, Jason. So, I'm just wondering about the puts and takes on gross margins going forward. I know there's been some elevated utilization this year but obviously you've had some client concessions too. So how should we be thinking about the moving parts as we try and put a finer point on our expectations for gross margin next year?
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Yes. So maybe I'll first focus on just kind of Q4. So generally what you have in Q3 is you've got higher levels of available working days or bill days. And so generally that has a positive impact on gross margin. And then you have lesser days in Q4 which has a negative. But we are beginning to see declines in the COVID-related concessions that have impacted both revenue growth and profit to a certain extent. Utilization continues to run a little bit higher and probably will be somewhat higher in Q4. And so I think you'll see the gross margin will kind of remain around the level that it was in Q3. On a go-forward basis, I probably shouldn't be talking about 2021 until we get to our Q4 call and had a little bit more thoughtfulness around it. But just talking about moving pieces, there's quite a bit, right? We'll clearly see a reduction in the COVID concessions as we enter the fiscal year. At the same time some of the questions that were asked earlier around what happens with pricing and everything, the pricing environment is not exactly the way it used to be. In some areas, we clearly have, there's some opportunity because demand is strong. But until there's a global improvement in the overall macro economy, I don't think you'll see the same types of pricing that you may have seen in past years.
Jason Kupferberg - BofA Securities, Inc.: Perfect. What's your initial sense of how COVID is impacting client budgeting processes for 2021 just in terms of the timing and the overall approach to those processes?
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: I think we already kind of answered this question. There is a lot of acceleration in movement. You're asking about internal processes or program – depending (00:52:23) on the program execution or what exactly?
Jason Kupferberg - BofA Securities, Inc.: Just clients as they start to think about their budgets for next year, how their budgeting process is changing just in terms of timing or just the overall approach in light of COVID? I think this is the time of the year when they would start, shape those plans for next year. So, as you're talking to your customers, are you getting any sense for whether or not budgeting processes are going to be pushed out or they're going to look different this year than in prior years?
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: I think it's a little bit early at this time. Even in normal year, it will be a little bit early at this time. But definitely, we're feeling that this conversation is starting (00:53:11) happening but – and everybody kind of still in the annual cycles, traditionally, but at the same time, I think everybody understands that the cycles will be much more quarterly or even monthly and whatever decision would be made in the next several months, it could change very quickly. And I think everybody now in this long plan cycles thinking little bit differently. So, but in any case, it's too early at the beginning of November to comment.
Jason Kupferberg - BofA Securities, Inc.: Okay. Got you. (00:53:49) situation. Makes sense. All right. Thank you, guys.
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Your line is open.
Maggie Nolan - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Hi. How much are you seeing clients ask for pricing concessions versus maybe the March timeframe? And should we expect any changes to pricing structure fixed versus time-and-materials, et cetera?
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: I mean, we've had a subtle shift towards fixed fee that I think you'd see it in our fact sheet. But I don't think you'll – it may continue to drift a little bit with a slightly higher fixed fee component. But again, we're still going to substantially be the T&M from a revenue generation standpoint.
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: And it's definitely very different environment than was in March. So I think while we not expecting exactly coming back to the rate conversation and increases like it was 12 months ago. It's a very different environment right now. And when we're talking about growing demand, it's very visible at least for us and we're seeing pretty interesting kind of competition for right capabilities to execute those programs much faster. So, in some situations, there are – again, very different feels than it was March, April.
Maggie Nolan - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then are there any specific goals or a timeline for your efforts to create a more kind of diverse global workforce whether that be in terms of geographic distribution or embracing remote work arrangements in a more meaningful way? (00:55:41)
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Yeah. I understand. And this is pretty long (00:55:48) conversation, but in general, you probably seeing what we're doing for the last eight years and how we diversified our global delivery strategy coming just from pure Eastern Europe going to China, India, Latin America, and this is happening as we speak as well. So, there's diversification happening as well. On top of this, we're thinking about and we mentioned what it means work of the future for us as well. And I think the next level of just globalization with actually distribution of the work would be happening. And again, it's coming back to our efforts to have a right platform support for this, right talent management, practices again supported by platforms. We're seeing that COVID just pushing this strongly to the future quickly.
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: And again, just on kind of more tactical metrics, so the fastest-growing geographies for us in Q3, Mexico, India, Europe. So, we continue to, kind of, diversify and become increasingly global. Within the CIS region, we're growing most rapidly in the Ukraine. But you continue to see a, sort of, expand our geographic footprint.
Maggie Nolan - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vladimir Bespalov with VTB Capital. Your line is open.
Vladimir Bespalov - VTB Capital CJSC: Hello. Congratulations on the number and thank you for taking my questions. I want to ask you about utilization. The third quarter is usually a period of vacations, but this time it was very different. So, is there any risk for the future that a lot of vacation time has been accumulated by employees and this might affect the supply side some time going forward? And I would also ask and want to ask on the comments, which you made during the call that in your guidance, you built in some potential issue, I would say, with clients in December and things like this, which are not materializing yet. So, maybe, from the supply side, what kind of growth, if everything is good in terms of attrition, hiring, utilization and things like this, what kind of growth you could support in the fourth quarter if everything is good? Thank you.
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: All right. So, let me just clarify a little bit on the comment. The furloughs still can come, right? So, we just try to be thoughtful around the impact on what you described, either vacation or furloughs or potentially any other types of disruption. And so, again, there's just a thoughtfulness. And, again, at this point, we'll still see what happens here in the remainder of November and December. I think from the standpoint of, clearly, demand exceeds supply. But it would be hard to sort of size, like there's too many kind of puts and takes in the numbers to sort of size what upside could be. I think we feel that the $695 million and $705 million is a well-reasoned number based on the environment. I should comment that we don't expect to see much FX benefit in the quarter and we also have a much lower level of acquisition or inorganic. So, that 10.6%, it's in the midpoint, is pretty much truly a 10-plus percent organic constant currency growth rates. And as Ark said, it's kind of one of the highest sequential growth rates that we've seen year-over-year – sequential growth rates that we've seen over time. And so, I think it's – again, it's a good solid sort of revenue guidance.
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: The question was about Q4 or general for the future?
Vladimir Bespalov - VTB Capital CJSC: It was mostly about Q4 but if you could comment on the future, it would be great.
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: I think our traditional answer would be, we would like to come back to our 20% plus, so. And again, that's a balance between demand and supply and it's about the quality of the supply. So, that's why we're still targeting out solid 20% plus for the future.
Vladimir Bespalov - VTB Capital CJSC: Thank you very much. And on the accumulated vacations and things like this, maybe you could comment a little bit. How do you see this or there is no problem with that?
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Yeah. I don't think there's any – I mean, again our guidance both in terms of revenue and profitability incorporates, let's say, an appropriate estimate and we're pretty focused on what that looks like and what the productive capacity looks like. So, I wouldn't expect anything unusual to occur there.
Vladimir Bespalov - VTB Capital CJSC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our last question is from our line from Arvind Ramnani with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Arvind Ramnani - Piper Sandler & Co.: Hi. Thanks for talking my questions. Most of my questions have been answered, but just if you could talk about your enterprise sales in a remote working environment? You're certainly not able to visit your clients at their offices or at industry conferences, but have continued to grow quite nicely. Can you talk a little bit about how you're generating your leads, how you're closing – continuing to close large deals either at new clients or even at existing clients?
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: I honestly don't know how exactly to answer this question. So, basically, through Microsoft Teams and Zooms (sic) [Zoom] (01:02:05) now. So, other than that, I don't think it might changes. Yes, we thought it will be huge impact and everybody else as well, but I think people found a way how to communicate.
Arvind Ramnani - Piper Sandler & Co.: Yeah. Great. And then, no, just related to this question, if you kind of look at 2020, are there some lessons you have learned from an operational perspective that you expect to use in a post-pandemic world? Are there things that you're looking to change from operational perspective as you kind of look ahead for the next two years?
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: I think we probably got somewhat nimbler, particularly in the area of sort of supply and demand matching. And there's a number of things that we've done to I would say sort of accelerate processes of getting resources onto accounts. In that I think one of the other areas just from a financial standpoint as I think we have made some real changes in our invoicing and cash collection processes. And it's part of what has contributed to that decline in DSO and the real improvement in cash collection and our cash balances.
Arvind Ramnani - Piper Sandler & Co.: All right. Thanks and good luck for the remainder of the year.
Jason Peterson - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Thank you so much.
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Arkadiy Dobkin for closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin - EPAM Systems, Inc.: Thank you again for attending the call today. I hope everybody will stay healthy during this time. And if you have any questions, David is available to help as always. Thank you and talk to you in three months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-08 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the EPAM Systems' Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.
David Straube: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's second quarter fiscal 2020 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I hope that all of you are staying safe and healthy at the time and thank you for joining us today. Before I go into the second quarter highlights, I would like to reflect on the overall environment in the context of EPAM business. First of all, since our last conversation in the beginning of May, the environment has definitely stabilized across our client portfolio, as our customers were responding to the many disruptions and, in some cases, permanent changes in the end markets. At the same time, very much in line with what we shared during our Q1 earnings call, the impact we are seeing is very immediate, serious and localized for each and every one of us and our customers. And more importantly, while it's not a news anymore for anybody, we do understand that we are still far from the end of the event. A steady dynamic environment continues to be influenced daily by global health crisis, social unrest and economic anxieties. We also can state that there are many examples where the current situation is changing the way our clients are doing business, engaging their customers and dealing with their end markets. As a result, this change has required them to accelerate digital programs and projects, or in some cases, new models of engagement. We ourselves have taken the challenge of COVID to drive much further our own adaptive program by bringing EPAM leadership closer to the field and making the field operations across EPAM market locations collaborating at much higher levels. This closeness has taken our agility to the next level, enabling us to be more responsive to our clients' needs, new business opportunities as well as making faster money from our decisions. The enhanced view of demand also has been pivotal to helping us gain much more real-time insight, be able to better mention global supply to the clients' needs and to optimize business efficiencies and to drive results. And as remote working model has quickly become widely accepted and proven way to serve our clients, we believe this way of working will serve us well in the future as we continue to manage the downside risk, but also take advantage of expanded options when it comes to the talent acquisition and retention. In the result, we are working very closely with our clients' teams to define and respond to demand in much more condensed time frame. These new partners of engagement are supported by our increased investment in knowledge management, collaboration and productivity platforms, enabling quicker access to information and improve business processes to empower our teams to connect faster and share information seamlessly and be more productive when responding to relentlessly fast-paced environment. Today, that is one of the most important areas of focus for us. Moving to our second quarter results. We delivered revenue of $632 million, representing 15.5% in constant currency growth, a non-GAAP EPS of $1.46, a 15% rounded year-over-year increase. Our Q2 results reflect an efficiency and execution on lower levels of demand, while focusing on driving higher levels of performance across the company. Within the quarter, there were a few highlights that are worth mentioning to bring better insight to what we already stated in general terms. As I shared previously, there is a level of stability in our end markets, which has allowed many of our customers to resume or move forward with the change programs. A number of our customers are focusing on streamlining their efforts as they reduce the number of service providers and consolidate across fewer key workers. In many of such cases, we are benefiting by being asked to do more in helping with critical business and transformational efforts. To balance this, there are some industries and specific customers, which remain significantly impacted by the global pandemic, and we don't know when they will return to business as usual level of activity. We know that there are some cases which are showing not stacking growth even in the current environment. For example, Epic Games achieved that no other gaming company has before, a digital ecosystem that provides infrastructure and services needed to power gaming in Fortnite measured scale for every developer to access across any platform, engine and store. Combined with a healthy library of games through the Epic Games store as well as the Unreal Engine, the world's most open and advanced real-time 3D tool. We are proud to have been part of Epic Games story since before the creation of Fortnite. With our big data, software engineers and AWS expertise, EPAM has collaborated with Epic Games to provide the flexibility, reliability and scalability needed to continue to push the boundaries of online gaming and help Fortnite growing from one million players in 2017 to 350 million today. In Q2, we also began working for several large new customers who have undertaken a multiyear transformation of their business. EPAM has been engaged to help with application development and enhancement efforts across several key areas of the organization. And while it's still early days in the relationship, we believe there is a potential to add one or two of them to top 20 customers list over the next 12, 24 months. We are also proud to share our recent partnership with UNICEF, resulted into developing a multi-featured HealthBuddy COVID-19 information app, designed to protect children, families and communities across Europe and Central Asia by dispelling the myth and rumors circulated with COVID-19. And lastly, probably as a result of everything we just shared, in recent quarterly sector outlook for IT services webinar, Gartner provided competitive assessment across 15 legislative service providers, highlighting EPAM as one of only two companies, which are best positioned for COVID and after COVID types. With that, let me share how we are looking at the second half of our fiscal 2020. We expect some continued disruption in our end markets, which will result in lower growth in a few industries we serve. While some of the variability in our client behavior has reduced, we still believe it's challenging to talk about our business outlook beyond the next quarter, which Jason will cover right after. Similarly, as we shared with you during our previous earnings call, our key priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to protect our people and our financial position as well as to make continuous investment in our core capabilities and platform to be prepared for eventual comeback. We strongly believe our position as a leading provider of digital product and platform engineering services, combined with our integrated and maturing consulting expertise, is our key differentiator. That is why we are very confident in our ability to come out of this challenging time, be even more value and result-driven company and continue growing in post pandemic environment with 20% plus rate. Now let me hand the call over to Jason.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, EPAM focused on supporting our customers' needs and operating our organization efficiently in an uncertain demand environment. The result of this effort was a quarter where we delivered better-than-expected results across multiple financial and operational metrics. In the second quarter, revenue came in at $632.4 million, a year-over-year increase of 14.6% on a reported basis and 15.5% increase in constant currency terms, reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of approximately 1%. Revenue for the quarter was higher than our previously guided range due to somewhat better-than-expected demand, combined with greater availability across our delivery organization and, therefore, higher billable utilization. Moving to our industry verticals. In Q2, we saw greater variability across the portfolio due to the impact of the pandemic on certain customers and their end markets. Business information and media, which delivered very strong results, posted 42.9% growth in the quarter and continues to be our largest industry vertical. Life Sciences and Health Care grew 16.4%, reflecting a lower level of growth for both industries. The vertical was impacted by a tougher year-over-year comparison. Software & Hi-Tech grew 13.2% in the quarter. Financial services grew 6.3% in Q2. Growth in the quarter was impacted in part by an expected ramp down of the European banking clients. Travel and Consumer was flat in the quarter. Growth in this vertical was impacted by a decline in travel and, to a lesser extent, retail, offset by growth across some consumer branded goods customers. And our Emerging vertical delivered 11.9% growth, driven primarily by clients in telecommunications, offset by a slowdown in the energy sector. From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region, representing 60.4% of our Q2 revenues, grew 14.1% year-over-year or 14.4% in constant currency. Europe, representing 33.4% of our Q2 revenues, grew 19% year-over-year or 19.8% in constant currency. CIS, representing 3.5% of our Q2 revenues, declined 12% year-over-year and 3.3% in constant currency. And finally, APAC grew 20.5% year-over-year or 21.9% in constant currency terms and now represents 2.7% of our revenues. In the second quarter, growth in our top 20 clients was 26% and growth outside our top 20 clients was 7% compared to the same quarter last year. We saw increased concentration among our top 20 customers as our larger clients appear to be more resilient during the quarter and continue to make investments in response to the changing business environment. COVID-19 appears to have had a greater impact on clients who are midsized. And as the business environment improves, we anticipate the revenue contribution from these clients to increase. Now moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 33.7% compared to 35.5% in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35.1% compared to 36.8% for the same quarter last year. Gross margin in the quarter was impacted by COVID-19-related customer concessions that were provided on a limited and temporary basis. GAAP SG&A was 18.1% of revenue compared to 20.3% in Q2 of last year and non-GAAP SG&A came in at 16% of revenue compared to 18.5% in the same period last year. Our reduced SG&A levels in the quarter were substantially driven by a lower level of activity related to hiring, relocations, travel, and marketing events. GAAP income from operations was $83.4 million or 13.2% of revenue in the quarter compared to $72.9 million or 13.2% of revenue in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $108.2 million or 17.1% of revenue in the quarter compared to $92.6 million or 16.8% of revenue in Q2 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 12.4%, which includes a greater-than-expected level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits, was 22.3%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.14. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.46, reflecting a 14.1% increase over the same quarter in fiscal 2019. In Q2, there were approximately 58.2 million diluted shares outstanding. Now turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q2 was $146.2 million compared to $44 million in the same quarter for 2019. Free cash flow was $134.7 million compared to $32.4 million in the same quarter of last year, resulting in 158% conversion of adjusted net income. EPAM ended the quarter with more than $1.2 billion in cash and available borrowing capacity, made up of $993.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, $60 million in short-term investments and $275 million available on our revolver. DSO was 73 days compared to 76 days at the end of Q1 2020 and 79 days in the same quarter last year. Now moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended the quarter with approximately 32,300 engineers, designers and consultants, a 9.7% increase year-over-year and a sequential decline from Q1. Our total headcount for Q2 was 36,400 employees. Utilization was 83.9% compared to 78.4% in the same quarter last year and 79.5% in Q1 2020. The high level of utilization in Q2 was the result of the greater capacity across the delivery organization, given the stay-at-home restrictions and limitations on travel during the quarter. We expect utilization to return to levels in the high 70s during the second half of fiscal 2020. Now let's turn to guidance. With the continued uncertainty in the market due to the current pandemic, we will continue providing a quarterly business outlook while holding off on a full year view. As Ark mentioned, we've seen a stable level of activity in our portfolio over the last 90 days as our customers are adjusting to changes in their end markets. Looking forward, we expect continued stability in Q3 with some improvement in the demand environment. Our capacity to generate revenue in Q3 will again be dependent on our ability to add headcount to meet improvements in demand while operating at more typical utilization levels. For Q3 of fiscal year '20, revenues will be in the range of $633 million to $643 million, producing a year-over-year growth rate of 8.5% at the midpoint of the range. For the third quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13% to 14% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 16% and non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.24 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.49 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 58.6 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for Q3. Stock compensation expense is expected to be approximately $19 million. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is expected to be approximately $3 million. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $3 million loss for the quarter. Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $5.6 million. We expect excess tax benefits to be around $5.9 million. All in all, we delivered a good quarter, successfully navigating a challenging business environment. I would like to thank our employees across the globe for their hard work and dedication to EPAM's success. Operator, let's open the call up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.
Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, guys and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment on the kind of competitive environment in the context of this pandemic. I mean, you mentioned consolidation of vendors among clients and that could potentially be a tailwind for you guys. If you could just give us a little bit more color on that, particularly on that process in terms of vendor consolidation. How strong of a force do you think that is in the market? How could that change the competitive environment?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I wish it would be easy to answer the question because like, as we mentioned, the situation is not stable at all. But definitely, one of the reaction of the clients on this change was consolidation. And we've seen this clearly, specifically across large clients. So it's not something really new, but it was accelerated during the last two quarters, practically. And I don't know what – how exactly to quantify it. It's definitely happening at a number of large clients.
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And then I wanted to ask about the – you'd mentioned kind of limited and temporary concessions. I'm just curious how much of an impact that might have had in the quarter and expectations there about – around that continuing into next quarter. Is that a headwind we should sort of expect again? Or is that really just sort of a one-and-done phenomenon this past quarter?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So in the quarter – in Q2, and then I'll talk about Q3 as well, we'd have had a modest impact on revenue, but it did show up in our gross margin number. And to be clear, if you think about clients, particularly, for instance, a midsized airline that is doing 10% of the revenue that they had expected to do and they have – asking their employees to work two days a week and take a 60% or greater sort of pay cut. When you have a discussion with that type of client, it's very hard to say, hey, look, we're not going to do something to support you. And so we had a series of those types of conversations, again, for definitely a minority of our customers, those who had very challenged kind of revenue models. The discounts are definitely sort of temporary, intended to sort of bridge through a COVID period. We expect that the impact will decline between Q2 and Q3 and then, again, in Q4. And again, it's a temporary to just be a supportive partner of certain of our more challenged clients.
Ramsey El-Assal: All right, terrific. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.
Jason Peterson: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Jason Kupferberg: Hey, good morning, guys. I just wanted to ask a question about the Q3 revenue guide. I know at the midpoint, you're looking for 8.5% constant currency growth versus the 15.5% we just saw in the second quarter. So understandably, you want to continue to be conservative in this environment. But I'm wondering if there's some specific call-outs that would drive the slowdown? How much of it is supply driven? And do you think that Q3 will be the trough for year-over-year top line growth?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So we feel clearly much better about the demand environment. What we saw in Q2, I think, consistent with what some of our peers have said is sort of stabilization kind of in the middle of the quarter. And then we've also seen some really interesting growth opportunities, both with existing clients. And actually, we've had some nice new logo wins even during the pandemic when we couldn't meet with clients and they couldn't come visit us in our delivery centers. So clearly, the demand environment is improving. At the same time, you'll note that we really didn't add any headcount. Actually, headcount declined between Q1 and Q2. And so we've turned back the recruiting engine. We've turned the recruiting engine back on, but we've kind of had a quarter where we didn't add headcount. And so that is going to have an impact on the growth rate as a percentage growth rate. We're clearly back hiring relatively aggressively at this time to support what we see is a solid improvement in the demand environment.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. Yes. No, okay. I think I get it. So maybe...
Jason Peterson: I mean, you got to think about the fact that we usually would have hired, I don't know, 1,500-plus employees, and those employees aren't here right now, right. So that is going to have an impact on. So again, it is very much – or much more so supply-driven. Right now, we're back in a time where demand feels certainly improving. And now it's all about putting supply in place.
Jason Kupferberg: Right. Right. So a few months ago, obviously, things felt worse and you were less willing to keep the recruiting engine on and now you've ramped it back up, I'd say. I guess as part of that, any issues finding the right talent in the right geographies?
Jason Peterson: Issues finding the right talent in the right geographies.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I'm smiling because even in this situation, like I can repeat what repeating for the last several years. So it's a very different environment in general. But for the talent it's very similar because like with the situation, as you heard – as you see, the kind of competition for talent on global level only growing. So – and while revenue impact because of specifically all these budgets and all these uncertainties happen, gave kind of relief for some period of time. It seems like in the future it will be very, very competitive. And it's feel and visible even right now.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So we feel comfortable with our ability to hire to support the demand. But as Ark said, the market continues to be somewhat challenging.
Jason Kupferberg: Right. Just a follow-up on margins. I guess, to the extent that those stabilize or even creep higher, would that more likely be driven by improved top line growth or SG&A leverage, recognizing that utilization coming down in the second half of the year?
Jason Peterson: Yes, correct. So we had very high utilization in Q2. We expect that, that utilization level will decline between Q2 and Q3. At the same time, I expect you're going to see a solid improvement in gross margin between Q2 and Q3. And that's driven by a number of factors. One, as I said, the discounts are time-based and temporary. So the level of discount will decline between Q2 and Q3. We had some revenue recognition impact in Q2, largely related to Russian financial institutions. And again, it's something that we occasionally experience where we start work, but we don't have a signed contract and so we're not able to recognize revenue. We'll have less of that impact in Q3. Then we usually – the usual impact of Q3 is there's more available workdays in Q3. So that has a positive. So those three positives will exceed the impact of lower utilization. And I expect a solid improvement in gross margin between Q2 and Q3. And that's part of the reason for the guide of 16.5% to 17.5% despite the fact we also expect an elevated SG&A as a percentage of revenue relative to the 16% we booked in Q2.
Jason Kupferberg: Got it. All right, thanks for the commentary.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open.
Bryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask here just 2Q outperformance, the bridge then to the 3Q view. So can you just talk about some of the drivers of the better 2Q results versus your expectation? Was there any shorter-term work benefits there that contributed any industries that pulled some things forward? So I'm trying to get a sense on pipeline tone that you have here and whether 3Q is the trough from growth, so to speak?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So Q2 situation just reflects how volatile the whole environment was at the beginning of Q2 and how it's ended up. So the level of uncertainty between clients and utility was very different at the end of the quarter. So – because I understand your question you're asking why Q2 results were so much higher than expected, right?
Bryan Bergin: Yes. It was, obviously, solid outperformance relative to where we stood three months ago. And understanding you're giving a relatively, I guess, prudent view here for 3Q, given the uncertainty. So I'm just trying to understand whether there were things pulled forward that caused you to outperform here and that's why you're your 3Q is down.
Arkadiy Dobkin: No, no. This is just very volatile environment where clients were making kind of one assumption at the beginning of the quarter and change it then. So – and that's exactly, I think, a reflection of how we were like communicating at this point. And right now, as we mentioned already, environment feels much more stable. So there is no like daily changes or weekly changes in client behavior. It's much more predictable. That's why we feel that Q3 feels better. But as you know, it's still not business as usual, and that's why we're still not comfortable to predict what's going to happen in Q4.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So Ark kind of talked about market and customers and the fact that we didn't pull anything in. I think I'll just answer simply from an algebraic standpoint. We had this, what I call, a slightly perverse impact of the pandemic. Demand was somewhat better than we expected, as Ark said. But we – people couldn't go on vacations. In many cases, those of us who were in major cities, you couldn't go outdoors to do anything other than to grocery shop and walk your dog. And so you had people who would have had booked vacations that did not take those vacations, and instead, they worked. And so we saw much higher levels of utilization, and that helped – in the T&M business that helped drive some of the revenue overage. And we expect that the utilization levels will return to normal, which again is high 70s. And so part of what you're seeing is arguably a supply constraint that's a result of people beginning to take vacations in Q3 when they didn't take vacations in Q2, if that's clear.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. Yes. And then just a follow-up here. Just as revenue growth does recover, are there aspects of what you've done in the cost structure that will enable you to sustain margins at a higher level? Understanding utilization is going to come back down, but anything on the corporate side or anything like that, that helps you have a more confident view here on profitability going forward?
Jason Peterson: So I wanted to, first, I think comment on the negative. So we ran at 16% SG&A, and we do expect that to head back towards the 18% to 19% range that I've guided to in the past. It will take some time, so I don't expect to end up in that range in Q3, but we probably would end up in the 17% to 18% range. I do think, though, that we clearly have learned during this process, right. And so we did a lot more – a lot better job, to be honest, probably of matching supply and demand and being very nimble to respond to changes in individual clients. So for instance, you had a ramp down of one client and a ramp-up in another. Rather than hiring to support the ramp-up, we were very careful to try to match staff that were coming off one customer to – and then to put them on the ramping account. So I think we got more nimble there. So who knows what impact that could have on bench and utilization. And I think, that what you'll continue to see now, particularly in both the SG&A and to a certain extent in the gross margin line is renewed investment to support that in excess of 20% growth rate that we expect to return to in the not overly distant future. But again, so I think there'll probably be things that will be kind of on the margin in terms of positive impact, including probably less travel and some of that. But I think, I would still sort of articulate that our greater than 20% growth rate with a profitability range of 16% to 17% sort of consistent profitability is how we intend to land once we kind of get through the challenging economic times.
Bryan Bergin: Okay, understood. Thank you.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Your line is open.
Ted Starck-King: Hey, this is Ted on for Maggie. Thanks for the taking the question. Ark and Jason, could you talk a little bit about the hiring in this type of environment? And maybe how that differs to a year ago, just largely speaking, the work-from-home environment?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think it would be more proper to talk about it like next quarter because like if you understand like what's happening dynamically in the market, and Q2 wasn't exactly the quarter where people were hiring a lot. So that's why it's difficult to answer the question. It definitely was very different than last year. It was mild softer labor market. But again, Q2 probably will be an exception. So I think that question would be interesting to kind of review next quarter when some stabilization happen and people will start to kind of hiring again in bigger numbers. I understand a little bit confusion because we're saying that it's still a very competitive market, and it is a very competitive market, okay. But Q2, again, was an exception and wasn't much hiring was happening. So mostly like numbers was natural attrition, which is also lower. Involuntary attrition was higher than usual, okay? So that's all changes. Demand from clients was clearly lower than previous quarter. Everybody understand Q2 still huge different versus Q1. But right now, since the market stabilize, right now, the labor market starting to be – getting hotter as well. So – and I think next quarter will show the differences.
Jason Peterson: Yes. And we kind of ran the recruiting engine in kind of idle mode. We've turned that back on. As I think you've seen in the past, we've been able to add, in some cases, I think, in excess of 2,000 net additions. And so clearly, it will take us a little bit of time to go from idle to sort of fully running, but we're clearly doing work that we've always done with universities. We're beginning to do lateral hires. Again, our brand as a hirer continues to improve. And so I think you'll see us sort of turn it on and certainly push it harder as we go from Q3 to Q4.
Ted Starck-King: Okay. That's helpful. And then as you mentioned, Ark, the demand for digital transformation has accelerated. So I guess coming out of COVID, do you believe, I guess, just qualitatively speaking that EPAM could see a period of time where growth kind of exceeded that historical, like, 20% organic growth, right. Not necessarily looking for specific guidance, just more in terms of kind of the growth trajectory and maybe if the floor for that revenue growth kind of in the medium-term here has maybe moved up at all. Appreciate your thoughts on that.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think I would rather confirm what we shared already today in our kind of general update that we would like to see how we return to 20-plus percent growth. And I think it's very, very visible because higher growth at this size, very difficult to accomplish because all of these components of the quality metrics which we need like to provide and everything else which we talked in the past many, many times. So, I think, the goal right now to return to normal for us, 20% growth. And, I think, the market definitely will support it. Higher than that, it's a different issue than just market demand.
Jason Peterson: Yes. And so as Ark said, generally, we've been operating at greater than 20% growth. So I think those types of growth rates which, I think, historically, have been more in the sort of 22% to 23% to even 25%.
Ted Starck-King: Okay. And if I could quick follow-up question. What was the organic growth rate this quarter? And what's included in guidance for Q3?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So the organic growth rate, so I'm going to decompose. So we've got 14.6% reported, on a constant currency basis we've got 15.5%. And then we've got about 2% benefit from inorganic. And so that was a 13.6% organic constant currency growth rate. We expect to get less of a benefit from, let's say, M&A related or inorganic. So we think that, that contribution is going to go from 2% in both Q1 and Q2 to 1% or maybe slightly above in Q3. So again, the – I think we feel pretty good about the growth rate considering the market. And again, very little of that is acquisition driven.
Ted Starck-King: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Surinder Thind: Hi, good morning. Just visiting kind of the comments – some of the earlier comments about revenues and growth. If I was to parse your comments about supply constraints, are you suggesting that 3Q marks the bottom for revenue growth? How should we think about that?
Jason Peterson: Yes. I mean the challenge without my sort of doing the algebra on the phone call, which I'm going to avoid, is – but I'm going to maybe help you with that. You have to probably go back and look at how many – how much headcount we were adding, let's say, in 2019 on a quarterly basis and then look at what we added in Q2, which was net negative. And think that, that comes out of the revenue number for a while until we can sort of catch that back up. And so, naturally, I think, going to take you to a place where you realize that it's hard to get in excess of 20% growth rate in the near-term because you've got a lot of hiring catch-up that you need to do. Again, solid demand environment, we're continuing to hire, but we have a quarter where we were appropriately responding to a very unclear and, as Ark said, sort of declining demand environment as we went from Q1 to Q2. Ark, do you have? Okay.
Surinder Thind: And then as a follow-up, can you help me understand the comment about the supply constraints and the fact that adding headcount still remains quite challenging, if I understood you correctly. Going back to last year, obviously, when you were growing above 20%, headcount was growing mid-teens. And so is there any reason you can't grow mid-teens plus or a lot faster than that at this point? Like what is – even at the...
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. I think we're missing the point of how the whole process working and what it means in terms of supply chain when you need to hire like thousands of people. So when something like was starting to happen in March and April, with predictions that everything will go down and clients' reactions as well. So you have to stop it, the whole engine of bringing people in, okay. And this engine, you cannot start just in one day or in one week, and that's what we're talking about. There is no anything systematic like problem which not recall, but we need like probably another quarter to restore the whole engine to work properly.
Jason Peterson: So – and maybe I wasn't clear enough, is that in the case of Q2 we're running at very little bench, right. So when we entered the quarter and we gave guidance, we said that, hey, if demand slacked, we were going to maintain our workforce and maintain our capacity for a return. And we guided to $590 million to $605 million. And here, we ran at $632 million. And so you can – so there's not a lot of inventory left in the form of bench, and so we've got to build our inventory back up again. And again, it means that we feel good about the demand environment. It means that we expect ongoing revenue growth. But as Ark said, it just takes a while to hire the thousands of employees that you need to get back to an in excess of 20% revenue growth rate.
Surinder Thind: Understand. So...
Arkadiy Dobkin: Plus, it's still like there is like from the market point of view, it's not the market's clear from demand to support 20%. Let's not forget this as well. It's not like we are in a normal environment. We are not. And we all understand that volatility is very, very strong. And like even what's happened in Q2 alone, it's stabilized. At the same time, many of us were thinking that the whole pandemic kind of situation going to improve and then the second wave started. And we still don't know how the second wave will come up like in another month or two and what it means actually for business. And business still haven't got potentially second wave. That's why we're talking about it's, by far, not business as usual still. It's much more stable than three months ago when we were talking about what we see. In May, it's much more stable, but it's incomparable with last year.
Surinder Thind: I think I understand in the sense that given the uncertainty you have to – obviously, it takes time to ramp up, but you also have to be cautious in the sense that there may be a second wave or something...
Arkadiy Dobkin: That's absolutely true because we don't want to ramp up and then have again situation like we were facing this at the beginning of Q2 or end of Q1.
Surinder Thind: That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, maybe a little bit more color on the demand environment and kind of the sales strategy. It seems like revenue concentration in your top five customers continues to climb. I'm assuming this is simply a function of them continuing to spend. These are larger clients in the downturn, whereas maybe your client – your smaller clients have gotten more defensive. So how are clients outside of the top 20 evolving at this point from a demand perspective? And the mix of new clients versus – is the vast majority of your growth at this point coming from existing clients of that 15.5%?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think during my kind of general overview, I was trying to bring specifically the points. Like I think, yes, largest client with whom we have strong relationship and level of trust, we're benefiting from consolidation, okay. There are a lot of opportunities for growth in large clients which feel better and more strategically jumping to prepare themselves for kind of unexpected situation like happened already, because somebody was asking about if we're seeing that all this digital transformation will allow us to grow faster than 20%. From this point of view, I think everybody understands that digital will be winning even more and demand will be even more and everything what's happened pushing us like for five, 10 years ahead than we expected like six months ago. So all of this happening. So on specific points, there are companies like there are new clients, and we have a number of new clients, pretty large ones, which, as we mentioned, we're thinking that probably in another 18, 24 months might become top 20. There are some growth in below 20 across a number of clients. At the same time, there are some impact on smaller clients, which not certain or didn't have financial resources to put together or actually in the industries which is very much impacted. So – and that's created this a little bit increase in concentration. So – but in general, we don't see any specific like or something unusual from reaction across the portfolio. I think it's pretty good feeling about opportunities throughout the portfolio.
Surinder Thind: Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Hey, good morning, Ark and Jason. How are you?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Very good. Thank you.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Yes, good to hear from you guys. Thank you for all the comments and details. One thing I wanted to understand was sort of a rate of change, if you will. So which verticals – or your conversations in which verticals are getting better and in which verticals are they getting worse? In other words, is there any kind of – the – I guess, the initial verticals that things like travel get hit, understood. But where are things getting incrementally better? Where are they getting incrementally worse?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So the funny thing, even at travel, which would have had an immediate impact coming into April by the – by, let's say, late in the quarter, you began to see certain of the travel customers come back and say, hey, look, we need to do certain things to be able to respond to the changes in the market. And so I would say it's, in some cases, maybe better, but at the same time, we clearly expect that that's going to continue to be challenged from an annual growth rate perspective. We continue to see strong and expect to see strong growth in the business information and media. Large companies looking to modernize their technology – large technology budgets. So we think that continues to be a strong opportunity for us. Health care, as Ark has talked about, we not only feel good about health care but also we've got some new opportunities there, new logos. And then, I think, the financial services might be a little bit mixed. As we talked about, we had a ramp down of a European bank, and that will show up again in the Q3 growth rates. But – and again, the technology is a little bit mixed for us. We've got some large technology clients, including one that Ark talked about in his – at the beginning of the conversation that continues to show good growth. And then we've got some smaller tech clients that probably continue to take a more defensive stance.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think like, in general, it's almost like practically each industry right now looking what they need to do next to prevent the situation. That's why like it really feels that there are opportunities across almost each industries, even the most impacted exactly because they were most impacted and they're thinking what to do during the next time. The problem still there that nobody understand where economy going to be in six months. So – and the juggling decision, jump right now or wait a little bit, or some of them have resources, some of them not. So – but my short answer would be that opportunities practically all over the place. And this is like at beginning of Q2 some of them completely stopped and then at the end they reverse decisions.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Understand. I understand. So as you kind of try to figure out some of these puts and takes, and you've clearly given your new outlook for 3Q here. When you gave your outlook for 2Q, there was a level of visibility. And as we went through that quarter, it looks like visibility increased and visibility – what's the visibility for 3Q relative to the same time 2Q? How are you feeling about that in terms of the potential for the upside?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So I think, we've talked about the fact that we've always had a series of systems and processes that are supported by the systems that we use to track demand and update on a daily basis. At the beginning of Q2, we also initiated a series of what we call standup meetings, Europe in the morning and North America in the afternoon, where we were very carefully collecting feedback on customer behavior. And certainly, there was an awful lot of ramp down activity at the beginning of Q2, which informed our guidance, okay. Right now, obviously, the tone of those conversations are radically, and I would say, kind of 180 degrees different. And so clearly now, we have much more comfort. We've talked about sort of improving demand. I would say, maybe strangely, more the uncertainty is around supply. And, again, this is going to sound kind of funny, but true, it depends on, to a certain extent, on how much available work we have, whether or not employees are on vacation or whether they're staying at home and working. And you understand how that dynamic would work in a T&M business.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Yes, absolutely. Got it. That color is useful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Jonathan Lee: Hi, this is Jonathan on for James. Congrats on the quarter guys. You mentioned being the beneficiary of vendor consolidation, but have you seen any pressure from larger diversified competitors? Or are customers still looking for best-in-class partners?
Arkadiy Dobkin: In our view, customers looking best-in-class partners specifically right now because everybody understands – again, coming back to how this crisis showing how important digital going to be in the future. And from our point of view, we're winning in some consolidation game exactly because of considering to be best-in-class right now.
Jonathan Lee: Got it. That's helpful. And then you touched on the strengthened demand environment, but can you provide color on sort of the pace of project starts by vertical. So which verticals are seeing sort of faster upstarts than others?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Honestly, in my view, it's still more specific customer dependent than specific vertical dependent. Again, probably, at least this is how it feel inside of our portfolio. But we're definitely seeing some acceleration across capital clients and health care, life science and media and communication as well. But there is still a lot of volatility. So it's very difficult to answer this question. This is certain that this industry growing much faster than others. Because like I mentioned like even some of them impacted, some of them making strategic decision and sometimes be surprised.
Jonathan Lee: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.
David Grossman: Thank you. Good morning. I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what's the client's perspective as well as your own on the dynamic of work-from-home? How that – how you would expect that to evolve in the back half of the year? And whether the percentages you think stay at an elevated level, even when the pandemic has abated?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it's kind of the second – the most interesting outcome of the whole situation in addition to acceleration of digital like the acceptance of working-from-home environment. And again, at some point, we expect that the clients will be much more demanding to return to more normal setup. But again, the second wave, practically starting this, and it's turned into a much longer exercise working-from-home. I think we still will get lessons from this because one thing when people considering, okay, I need to do it like for three, six months and then another like changing for almost permanent. But in short, I'm not going to say anything new here. Everybody understands that it was much, much better than anybody expected. And companies were able to turn to this environment and stay productive, much better than expected. And it's, for sure, that this environment is going to be with us for long term. The proportion of this is going to be 20/80 or 80/20 or 50/50, we will still have to see. Probably like in another six months, we will be having much better answer. But we definitely rethinking the whole infrastructure right now and how it works. While, again, we were preparing for this, I probably mentioned before that we probably one of the most distributed company with a number of small offices in comparison to any our competitors. So better prepare it for this. Now we're going like to improving the systems and operation and platforms to support even higher level of distribution. And I think we'll be benefiting from this. But again, the exact proportions, we'll still have to see.
David Grossman: And what is your preference? What is the best outcome for EPAM in your mind?
Arkadiy Dobkin: The best – it's definitely given additional level of flexibility in terms of finding the best talent independently of where its location and how it can work, from office or not from office, from large city or small city. From this point of view, it's additional dimension for talent, but it's not going to benefit just EPAM. It can benefit anybody who will be able to provide the right infrastructure. We do believe that we have advantage here.
David Grossman: Right. Okay. And then just – I want to go back to the customer cohort question about – so much of your growth historically has come outside that top 20. So I did hear your explanation, so you don't need to repeat that. But is there an element of supply here also where you're redirecting the limited supply that you did have in the quarter to your bigger clients as well as all the other things that you mentioned? And the only reason I ask is just so much of your growth historically is coming from outside the top 20 accounts. I'm just wondering if there – is this a temporary shift or is this something more permanent?
Arkadiy Dobkin: We do believe that outside 20 we'll start grow – and we'll be growing eventually faster. In this very dynamic environment, it's a little bit different because if you have established relationship and opinion changing quickly and you understand what you're doing, so sometimes it's easier to focus on known relationships and known facts. So it's part of this. But in general, like, let's not be confused about top 20. We have like – inside of top 50 or top 100, we have so many opportunities to grow that we're absolutely sure that it would be rebalanced again 1%, 2%, 3% up and down between all of this.
David Grossman: Right. Okay. And then just one last thing. I mean, Jason, I think you indicated you didn't want to go through the algebra, which I understand. But just back of the envelope, if I just kind of look at historic headcount growth, it looks like the absence of growth in headcount kind of hurt you a bit, about 5%. If you assume that the pricing is offset by utilization, it looks like you're about 500 basis point impact from the headcount issue. Does that sound about right to you?
Jason Peterson: Let me just look at it for a second here. Yes, I'm concerned about maybe what conclusion you might draw, but my rough math kind of, yes, would be somewhat consistent with that.
David Grossman: Got it. All right, guys. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is from Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Edward Caso: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I was just – could you just remind us how you hire people historically? How many are in-person interviews? How much is done virtually? How many from recent grads versus laterals? Just trying to get a sense of how you did it in the past, and I assume most hiring at the moment is virtual. And I'd be curious about the school cycle of recent grads. So how that might impact your ability to reaccelerate hiring? Thanks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, different locations is different. But in much more scalable locations, probably 50% of people coming from universities, but we have special infrastructure to go through like internal boot camps to bring the level of people to the right level. And it could be hundreds of thousands of people in these boot camps. And that's part of the style which was kind of slow down as well. And that's why we're explaining the whole logistic. But we're talking like almost each quarter about our platform and system. It includes like already distributed platform to interview and process and the whole workflow, which is part of our ecosystem. So from this point of view, doing this virtually, it's very much part of the culture as well. So...
Edward Caso: My other question – oh, go ahead.
Arkadiy Dobkin: From this point of view, we should be able to reengage the whole engine relatively quickly. But again, it still takes time, taking into account how much is distributed across multiple development centers and how much we need to like to put efforts around boot camps and all.
Edward Caso: Right. My other question around is your M&A efforts. What the pipeline looks like? I assume you kind of put it on hold in the last few months. So you're back looking again. And then given your significant balance sheet capabilities and sort of what areas are you looking?
Arkadiy Dobkin: From M&A point of view, I don't think there are any changes. So it never was put on hold. So it's actually – I would say that it's probably even accelerated area of focus, very, very similar to what were in the past. So there is no change here. The thinking is as usual. So when it would be happening so we will announce. But again, nothing change in M&A.
Edward Caso: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Arkadiy Dobkin for closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you for joining us. And again, hope that everybody is safe in this interesting time. And we're pretty positive about what's happening right now. It's much better than we thought will be like three months ago. So again, environment is stabilizing. Hopefully, it will be continuously stabilizing and let's see what we can share in three months. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-09 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to EPAM Systems' First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].  At this time, I'll turn the conference over to David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. You may now begin.
David Straube: Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter 2020 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today's call are Ark Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website.  With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Ark.
Ark Dobkin: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I do hope that all of you are staying safe and healthy during this global crisis, and I want to thank you for joining us. While it has been only 3 months since we shared our 2019 results and provided our somewhat expected by now 20%-plus annualized growth outlook for 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that everything we thought we knew then, just a few weeks later, started to be very much changing on a daily basis.  In real terms, the impact we are seeing all over the world is immediate, serious and localized for each and every one of us and for our clients. And more importantly, we believe that we are far from the end of this event. In fact, in the view of many, we are somewhere near the end of just the first period of disruption. So while we do understand that significant uncertainty is with us for some time, we wanted to give you a perspective of how EPAM is adapting to this new reality and where we think we might be going in the near future.  Since January, we've been responding to the COVID-19 crisis, and its -- all the impacts in our APAC region. To our benefit, we were able to take advantage of a good amount of work done over the past years to put in place realistic actions for business continuity as well as of investment in our internal platforms, which enable us to support truly agile global delivery environments, including readiness for remote workplaces and enhanced productivity measurements. Because of these efforts and combined with our early learnings from our APAC experiences in January and February, already in March, we were able to move nearly all of EPAM to a productive and safe work-from-home environment practically in a matter of days. This transition, which represented a pretty significant effort, was noticed by many of our clients for its speed and reliability of service continuity.  So at this moment, I wanted to share my deep appreciation to the thousands of EPAMers who are doing everything possible to support each other, to our customers for trusting us with their most critical issues and to our communities around the world, which we are supporting constantly with a different means for fighting the pandemic on the front lines. The health of our people continue to be a top priority for all of us during this time.  With that in mind, let me switch to our Q1 performance and then cover some of the changes we are making in order to support customers as we navigate this challenging environment and end with how we see the forces shape in the next few quarters of demand before turning the call over to Jason.  First of all, I am pleased to share that we delivered a stronger-than-expected first quarter results with revenues of $651 million, representing 26% in constant currency growth. Despite some of the early COVID-19 reactions in APAC and the first global pandemic impacts in March, Q1 came in $9 million higher than our initial guidance, underscoring the value of our diverse and high-quality portfolio and our ability to continue providing relevant and mission-critical services to our clients. Q1 marked also EPAM's 37th consecutive quarter of 20%-plus organic growth, the rate of growth we plan to return to postcrisis.  Starting from the end of Q1 and through the current quarter, the effect of the coronavirus on our customers has been significant and wide-ranging, with more than 1/3 of our portfolio having experienced some form of revenue impact and some industries experiencing never-before-seen disruption in their end markets. Customers in our travel and consumer verticals have taken a variety of serious steps to protect their people and to ensure a continued liquidity and viability of their businesses. And we believe that we may see several ways of impact as the crisis continue to unfold across other market segments as well.  It is important to note that across our portfolio, even while discussions are taking place about ways to manage cost during the crisis, many customers still have continued to move forward with programs or, in some cases, have chosen to accelerate the pace of their digital transformation in order to support radically changed demands for how they engage and serve their clients. We have supported some of these changes in a very, very short period of time, from virtual shutting down of brick-and-mortar operations for a major retailer and the move to pure-play online commerce to the massive, scaled infrastructure and demand needed to support virtual entertainment events for a major gaming platform.  Throughout the past several months, we are certain that the pace and scale of the pandemic is taking EPAM into new territory, both from the challenges of shifting our own way of thinking and doing things to really key directions in our offerings, ranging from how we imagine new digital platforms to what it means to be cloud-first.  To date, our success in managing the disruption has been due to our ability to leverage our product engineering heritage and expertise and to push ourselves to move and adapt even faster. Internally, this means an even more serious push to break down silos towards increased investments into knowledge management [indiscernible] and productivity platforms and to establish new faster processes, which enable our teams to address much more seamlessly and productively the challenges we are facing. Supported by all the investment in our network and security infrastructure, much of each has been stress-tested by our own hybrid delivery centers for the past years. We have and continue to develop new ways of working and helping our customers to respond to the crisis now.  All these demands for continued operations and faster and more reliable service offerings bring us back to our top priority as an organization, to be ready for the postcrisis time. And that is to retain, find, attract and develop our top talent. By continuing to invest in our delivery, collaboration, education and community platform and by focusing on our people, we are fulfilling a critical aspect of current and future demand for what is going to be an even more digital world.  Now I want to say a few words about the outlook for our industry segment and for EPAM, specifically. As most of you know, the digital service segment in which we operate was generally seen as a high-growth market, and it is. Unfortunately, in the current environment, it is nearly impossible to count on previous business-as-usual trends and prior period data assumptions to establish near-term models. This is why today, we are relying on very different and often close to realtime indicators and signals, first reviewing at our daily standard the changes that are occurring on the ground across our specific market and delivery geographies, industries and individual accounts. We are also looking at the market trends in general, competitors' disclosures, industry and financial market analyst projections.  For example, we looked into financial modeling across a number of publicly traded companies. And so the projection -- projected revenue ranges for many of them, just for the current Q2 of 2020, could vary very significantly, sometimes up to 20%. That is just another confirmation of how unpredictable the situation is.  Just 3, 4 weeks back, we also didn't think we would be able to guide even for the second quarter. But today, we are more comfortable and ready to provide a range for our Q2 results, and Jason will share those details shortly. At the same time, we still think it is extremely challenging to say with acceptable level of confidence what would be happening in Q3, as we are seeing high volatility in the client potential behavior. At this point, we are open for all types of scenarios, including another sequential revenue decline. That is why we decided not to provide a guide for the whole of 2020 at that time.  Our key priorities right now are to continue to protect our people and our financial position as well as to make continuous investment into our core capabilities and platforms in order to be better prepared for the comeback. And while these actions may have temporary impact on our profitability, we are absolutely confident of our ability to resume our leading position in the turnaround. In our view, now more than ever, the fundamental case for digital product and platform engineering services, combined with the ability to bring integrated consulting on the front end, is very much intact. And our proven ability to adapt ourselves and our company to a completely new operating environment in such a short period of time has given us the confidence to say that EPAM will come out of this challenging time a more value- and result-driven company and continue growing in a postpandemic environment with our somewhat expected by now 20%-plus rate.  With that, let me hand the call to Jason.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our first quarter financial highlights, follow with industry vertical performance and then touch on a few operational metrics, ending with thoughts for Q2.  Revenue for Q1 came in at $651.4 million, a year-over-year growth of 24.9% on a reported basis or 26% growth in constant currency terms, reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of 1.1%. Q1 revenue was higher than expected due to a greater-than-planned level of availability across our client teams, along with stronger performance from a few of our acquired companies.  During the quarter, we delivered consistent growth across the majority of the industry verticals. Business information and media, which in Q1 became our largest industry vertical, posted growth of 46%. Life science and healthcare grew 26.4% in the quarter, reflecting a tougher year-over-year comparison given the exceptionally strong performance in Q1 2019. Software and Hi-Tech grew 21.9% in the quarter. Financial services delivered 16.2% growth. Travel and consumer grew 14.6%. And our emerging vertical delivered 30.3% growth, driven primarily by clients in telecommunications and energy.  From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region, representing 59.9% of our Q1 revenues, grew 23.1%year-over-year [indiscernible] of our Q1 revenues grew 28.6% year-over-year or 30% in constant currency. CIS, representing 3.8% of our Q1 revenues, grew 36.8% year-over-year and 45.8% in constant currency. And finally, APAC grew 4.7% and now represents 2.1% of our revenues.  In the first quarter, growth in our top 20 clients was 30.5%, and growth outside our top 20 clients was 21% compared to the same quarter last year.  Now moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 34.9% compared to 33.9% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35.5% compared to 36.3% for the same quarter last year. GAAP SG&A was 19.2% of revenue compared to 19.5% in Q1 of last year, and non-GAAP SG&A came in at 17.6% of [Technical Difficulty].
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. We're experiencing technical difficulties.
David Straube: Rob, this is David Straube. We have had some technical problems with our webcaster. We are going to go live to reading our script. Can you just confirm that your [Technical Difficulty].
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. We've experienced some technical difficulties. David, please proceed.

CIS, representing 3.8% of our Q1 revenues, grew 36.8% year-over-year and 45.8% in constant currency. And finally, APAC grew 4.7% and now represents 2.1% of our revenues.  In the first quarter, growth in our top 20 clients was 30.5%, and growth outside our top 20 clients was 21% compared to the same quarter last year.  Now moving to the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 34.9% compared to 33.9% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35.5% compared to 36.3% for the same quarter last year. GAAP SG&A was 19.2% of revenue compared to 19.5% in Q1 of last year, and non-GAAP SG&A came in at 17.6% of revenue compared to 17.7% in the same period last year. GAAP income from operations was $87.5 million or 13.4% of revenue in the quarter compared to $64.7 million or 12.4% of revenue in Q1 of last year.  Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 11.3%, which includes a lower-than-expected level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits, was 22.8%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.47. And non-GAAP EPS was $1.43, reflecting a 14.4% increase over the same quarter in 2019. In Q1, there were approximately 58.1 million diluted shares outstanding.  Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q1 was $63.3 million compared to a negative $0.2 million in the same quarter for 2019. Free cash flow was $34.2 million compared to negative $13.6 million in the same quarter last year, resulting in a 41.2% conversion of adjusted net income. As a reminder, our cash flow in Q1 is impacted by payments related to our annual variable compensation programs, a portion of which will be paid in Q2. EPAM ended the quarter with over $1 billion in cash and available borrowing capacity, made up of $916 million in cash and cash equivalents and $270 million of available credit. DSO was 76 days compared to 72 days at the end of Q4 2019 and 78 days in the same quarter last year.  Moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended the quarter with more than 33,100 engineers, designers and consultants, an 18.7% increase year-over-year and a net addition of 550 production professionals. Our total head count for Q1 was more than 37,300 employees. Utilization was 79.5% compared to 79.9% in the same quarter last year and 77.9% in Q4 of 2019.  Before moving to our outlook for the second quarter, I would like to spend a few minutes talking about the steps we've taken to improve EPAM's responsiveness to our rapidly changing business environment. By staying close to our customers and updating expected demand on a daily basis, we have developed a detailed and realtime demand view for each customer around the world. This heightened view of demand has been used to drive a tighter connection between our supply and demand, allowing us to deliver revenues while dramatically reducing incremental hiring. In addition, we continue to evaluate our cost structure and reduce a substantial amount of discretionary spending while improving efficiency and retaining capacity in order to respond to future improvements in the demand environment.  Now let's turn to the guidance. As we mentioned in our April 9 preannouncement, due to heightened uncertainty related to the potential impacts of COVID-19 on our business results, we have suspended our full year 2020 financial outlook. However, our current thinking is to provide guidance for Q2, adopting ranges which we think is more appropriate than our historical and latest guidance. Revenues will be in the range of $590 million to $605 million, producing a year-over-year growth rate of 8.3% at the midpoint of the range. For the second quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 11% to 13% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 14% to 16%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 13% and non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.93 to $1.12 for the quarter and non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.12 to $1.31 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 58.4 million diluted shares outstanding.  Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for Q2. Stock compensation expense is expected to be approximately $16.1 million. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be [indiscernible]. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $3 million loss for the quarter. Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $4.5 million. We expect excess tax benefits to be around $7.2 million.  And lastly, one more assumption that is not part of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures. We expect interest and other income to be $1.4 million in Q2.  While we have seen some stabilization in our portfolio, we believe that certain of our end markets will continue to absorb the effects of the global pandemic. At this time, we feel confident we have the right focus on the things that matter in our business, including taking the necessary steps to position EPAM for a future that will demand higher levels of consulting, digital engagement and software engineering services.  Operator, let's open the call up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is coming from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: I guess my first question is with regards to expense flexibility, if you can kind of walk through the components. Jason, you mentioned some control over discretionary expense. If you can kind of quantify how we should think about it, how metrics such as utilization might trend? And also not just the flexibility you have, but also your willingness to use it versus keep focusing on growth.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So I mean maybe I'll start with the high-level point that our focus really is on controlling costs, including labor costs, while minimizing the impact on the employee base. And so we do want to make certain that we've got sufficient sort of capacity and capabilities to respond robustly to what we expect the improved demand environment in the future. So if I were to provide a little bit more descriptive color, late in Q1, we put significant cost controls in place related to discretionary spending, okay, including hiring. As we saw a slowdown in demand and that became more apparent, we dramatically reduced production hiring as well. We also began to evaluate whether or not we had the right staff in the right roles and began taking some performance-based actions. And then clearly, relocation, travel events, hiring-related expenses are well controlled just as a result of everything going on with COVID-19 and the related restrictions. And so as we move forward, we're going to make certain that we have as minimal impact on employees as possible but, at the same time, being kind of mindful of overall profitability. And I think that's implicit in that 14% to 16% profitability range that we guided to for Q2.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Yes. No, that answers it. There was a specific question with regards to utilization trends in there. But let me loop my second question in as well, with regards to -- you have obviously a lot of cash on the balance sheet. There's a general expectation that a number of assets that might have been attractive previously but, from a financial standpoint, maybe not accretive to make the deal, things like that. How do you think of M&A in the current situation? So that and the -- maybe the utilization thing from the previous question.
Ark Dobkin: We're clearly trying to find any bright spots in any situations. And in this situation, clearly, there are multiple opportunities, including M&As. But at the same time, it's probably too early -- like we didn't kind of cut any of our activities. We're looking at this. But probably, again, it's too early to see how attractive results is going to be. And also, as you understand, besides price attractiveness, there is -- for some of them, they're really changing the business. And we need to evaluate both criteria, how much impact was there and how price correspond to this. So -- but we will be definitely watching this.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Damian on for Ramsey. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the sales productivity. And I know it's probably really difficult to kind of get a read on this. But just maybe first, on a logistical perspective, now that everything is virtual, maybe some details on the sales opportunities there. And then on the demand side as well, what's your confidence level in your ability to refill that pipeline once some of the existing engagements that you're seeing now start to end?
Ark Dobkin: So I'm sorry, I missed part of the question. So you're asking about demand, supply, kind of management after coming out of the crisis?
Unidentified Analyst: And kind of the process when you're all remote.
Ark Dobkin: So I think from comfortability of remote operation, I think we are pretty comfortable. I think people -- in general, EPAM is a much more distributed company by design. And the number of delivery centers and size of this is very different from many other companies. So distribution wasn't like any real problem when we were moving to work from home very quickly. And I think it is pretty effective. And as you know, also from other sources, people are working in this environment unexpectedly productively, at least, that's what happened even in our engagement with the clients, even in consulting engagement, which now is starting to be performed completely remotely. So I think it's -- that's not much problem right now.
Jason Peterson: Yes. I think that, Ark, you may have missed the first portion of our script, which we're still trying to figure out how to resolve. But we've talked about the fact that we've been able to even do kind of business development remotely. We've got daily kind of war rooms with each of our business units, which we're talking about, not only some of the downsides to demands but also the upside and potentials that are made available by this kind of unique environment. And we continue to see opportunities, including kind of new engagements and in some cases actually potentially new engagements with new customers during this environment. With that said, obviously, there's clearly challenges in the environment. But kind of longer term, we feel very good about the expectations for the business. And again, in Ark's script, he talks about the fact that we look forward and expect to return to the greater than 20% growth over time once we come out of this crisis.
Ark Dobkin: Yes. And we cajole that our work-from-home at the moment is working much better than this call today. So -- because like -- and we're relying on an external agency for this. So I have to say this, too. Sorry about some inconvenience. It seems like you didn't hear a big portion of my introduction to the results in the quarter. Okay. We will try to address it through the Q&A. Sorry about it.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Yes. No. I apologize if I missed anything. I just had one follow-up, which is on pricing. It's historically been an advantage for EPAM, but we've seen some of your peers talk about the deterioration in the pricing environment. Are you seeing any changes in your ability to command the sort of premium prices that you had in the past in order to secure engagements?
Jason Peterson: Yes. I would say that I don't think that there's, let's say, a difference in terms of our ability to command a premium. But we've got clients in, for instance, the travel space who are seeing revenue declines of 70-plus percent. And then we also have retailers who got a slow start in China and now have a higher percentage of their stores closed. So the pricing environment certainly isn't the same today as it was at the end of the Q4 call, where I would usually talk about kind of regular price increases as a result of a scarcity in the market. But we're responding to our customers' challenges, okay, and doing so in a way that won't have a long-term impact on our profitability.
Ark Dobkin: I think that there is like -- the situation, in general, what we call and everybody call business-not-as-usual, and this creates completely different variety of demand. There are some situation when there is [indiscernible] and independently from pricing for new programs because some of the clients trying to prepare themselves was going to be after the crisis, and they understand that this period of time could be just extra availability of the talent and opportunity to build something in advance just for a couple of quarters. So -- and then there are some industries which is under huge pressure. So the variability of the different situation is pretty broad right now.  But fundamentally, we're very, very confident that it would come back. We don't know when, 1, 2, 3 quarters. But the demand would be probably even higher than what was the end of last year. And because of everything that's happening. Again, it's pretty odious right now, and we're trying to prepare ourselves exactly for this comeback. And we're pretty sure that pricing is not going to be an issue afterwards.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Kathy on for Jason. First, just wanted to clarify a comment you made in your prepared remarks. You mentioned that EPAM could potentially see quarter-over-quarter decline in 3Q. Are you seeing this as more of a base case in your scenario runs? Or is it more of a worst-case scenario? And have you seen any stabilization in any of the markets yet?
Ark Dobkin: I think if we would be able to estimate it better, we will share it. I think as soon as we know, we will know. But that's exactly what we see all scenarios right now possible.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So to be clear, we just did want to put that out there as a possible scenario. We see a little bit of stability as this evolves. But at the same time, we realized that we're not out of the woods yet. I just wanted to acknowledge that as a possible scenario.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Got it. And just wanted to ask a little bit more about the verticals. Are there any -- obviously, travel and leisure and retail are obviously seeing some more pressure. But are you kind of -- and then financial services sort of slowed a bit in 1Q. Are you expecting similar trends going forward? And have you seen any like reversal in trend so far at this point and now we're in early May?
Jason Peterson: Yes. I'd say, for instance, travel and hospitality, you can imagine is going to be a challenged space. And for us, that includes both retailers and consumer goods companies. All that would be impacted. Our emerging includes energy. And so clearly, that will have some impact. We continue to see very strong demand in business information and media, as you expect, saw a very strong demand in Q1 and are still seeing good, strong demand in Q2. In financial services, it's probably a little bit mixed, still seeing some good growth there. We do have another one of the European banks which is showing some declines, and we expect to see some declines in Q2.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Maggie Nolan with William Blair.
Maggie Nolan: You mentioned that more than 1/3 of the portfolio has experienced some form of revenue impact. Can you give a little more granularity on what you're seeing? Is it pushout of contracts, outright cancellations, extended time lines for contracts or changes to payment terms? Anything there would be helpful.
Jason Peterson: Yes. It would probably be kind of E, all of the above. And so what you see in some cases is companies that need to sort of just tighten their belt a little bit. In some cases, you see companies that are suspending certain programs. In some cases, you see companies that are actually accelerating programs or starting new programs. So it's not all negative. Some companies and clients are somewhat more concerned about their cash flows and are asking for what I would call sort of relatively modest extension of payment terms. And so it kind of varies. And again, it's kind of embedded in our expectations for Q2 in the reference to potential sequential decline in Q3. And again -- and what we're trying to do is make certain that we respond to our customers' needs but do so in a way that doesn't sort of permanently impact the business or the business model over the longer term.
Maggie Nolan: And then in terms of the guidance that you were able to put together for Q2, what types of assumptions have you made in that guidance in terms of the level of utilization that we may see? And do you expect any changes to productivity either in Q2 or kind of as we go forward, as you continue to adapt to this environment?
Jason Peterson: Yes. Maybe I'll just answer this super tactical question around utilization, and then I'll let Ark talk about productivity and how our workforce is performing in this new environment. From a utilization standpoint, this is going to be a quarter where the utilization is going to be very much informed by the revenue number. And so as we tried to communicate is that we want to be highly productive of the workforce. I think it's the right thing to do. And longer term, it's important for us to maintain our capabilities for what we expect to be very robust renewed demand in the future. And so if we end up at the low end of the range, we'll have lower utilization, as you can imagine. And if we end up the higher end of the range, the utilization will be pretty solid. Ark, do you want to talk about...
Ark Dobkin: And on productivity side, so we operate in like in this environment probably for a little bit more than months because like somewhere at the end of March, we moved practically everybody. Right now, it's 98% of our people working from home, and all of this was done just in several days. So first of all, infrastructure and level of distribution, EPAM traditionally was working on, was prepared for this. And the level of distribution traditionally was very high. We have multiple delivery centers, and it was historically to be able to reach out to maximum talent we can. So from this point of view, when it moved to home, it was kind of the next extension of the traditional model we have. And we didn't -- on top of this, you can understand, when we're talking about platform and everything else, there are a lot of things which we're trying to -- tried in the past how to measure productivity and how to make sure that in this distributed environment, it works. So that's why I think we didn't see, at least so far, any impacts on day-to-day operation. Opposite, we have seen a lot of compliments from our clients about how speedy we are and how productive we are in this environment, specifically in comparison to many others. So that's why from the model point of view, we don't see any significant changes.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen.
Bryan Bergin: I wanted to ask on the top customers. Can you talk about your views and your interaction specific to your top 10? You had a very strong 1Q with those. Can you give us a sense of what type of mix those top 10 may be in more pressured industries?
Ark Dobkin: So top 10 is a still pretty broad group. We have some travel companies there. We have financial companies. We have technology companies. In general, actually our top 10 are doing pretty well, but there are exceptions there as well.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So increasingly, we're seeing more business information and media customers in the top 10 as well.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. And then just as we think longer-term, structural changes that you think stem from the pandemic here for the service industry? And any insight you can share of what you're thinking about as far as changes to your potential delivery model?
Ark Dobkin: You mean how we're providing services?
Bryan Bergin: Right.
Ark Dobkin: Yes. I think there are multiple assumptions how everything is going to change or a portion of this, how much a work-from-home or an additional level of distribution and delivery model would be accepted. We actually were doing some experiments before and tried to ask clients if they would be open for this. And in general terms, it was pretty negative reaction. And then everything changed with this event. So I think the level of acceptance of distribution are a different level of acceptance of the much more distributed talent, and how to orchestrate and originate this type of work will be very different after the event -- or again, it's very different already. So I think it would have impact on how we're working in the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies.
Surinder Thind: One question I'd like to start out with is just the difference in visibility between Q2 and Q3. Obviously, you guys were comfortable enough to provide guidance for Q2. Can you talk about the difference in your level of confidence? How wide, I guess, a range of outcomes does there have to be for you to not provide guidance for Q2?
Jason Peterson: Yes. I'm going to actually just talk about some of the processes that we use just so that we've always had a very robust kind of process around our pipeline. And we have a system that we use and a set of daily updates. And so we have an updated sort of daily pipeline. In addition, we have instituted processes during this more variable time where we have sort of a daily series of sort of business unit stand-up meetings where we talk about potential ramp-downs, potential opportunities, other sort of sharings around areas of opportunity in the business. And so we've got a very sort of regular updating of activity around clients.  And then we're staying as close with clients as possible and connecting with them on very regular or maybe even daily basis to get inputs as to kind of what their plans are and importantly where we can help them. And so that's the reason why we can give you a very good sense for kind of Q2 because we are running an even tighter process than usual, and we've got very good processes in place around demand. But the challenge is you just don't know what's going to happen, I would say, more kind of macroeconomically and kind of what happens kind of, I think, as economies and cities and states and countries try to reopen. And so I think that's why we've been more careful about any guidance around Q3.
Surinder Thind: That's helpful. And then one follow-up related to -- if you can talk a little bit about the mechanics of the pipeline or the visibility in the sense that how much of an advance notice are you getting if projects get put on hold from your clients? And then maybe related to the delta in the growth rate between obviously what was a really good normalized number versus where you are now. Is that primarily just the new clients not coming onboard at this point? Or is it just existing clients putting some projects on hold? Can you talk a little bit about the relative color there as well?
Ark Dobkin: Let me bring a little bit color like let's start with what's really happening. Let's try to think what happened at the end of March or second part of the March when suddenly, governments starting to issue very special conditions how to operate. If you think about it, like at the beginning of April, we didn't think we could even guide because nobody knew what's happening. Clients didn't know how they could -- can they create their production lines kind of starting, they didn't know what's happening with their clients. Like, for example, at the beginning of April, we saw that it would be much worse than it is. That's how dynamically everything happened, with clients starting to communicate very different things. Then 1 week later, they're starting to change their views.  Then another week, they're starting to change their views. That's why when you're asking these questions, you can say that everything was on the table and everything was happening. Why we could guide at the end eventually for Q2, because with our daily standup, with our kind of realtime signals from clients, from the market, we saw that the core for this change become much more predictable and stable. That's why we decided to share a guidance for Q2. But at the same time, it's still pretty volatile. It's volatile enough that we don't know what will be in Q3. And that's exactly what we're sharing.  So what we also understand is that if clients saying something today, good or bad, it doesn't mean that it would be the same position 2 weeks later.
Surinder Thind: I understood that. I think that, that's the key point from my perspective, it's just the uncertainty at the client level given that within such a short period of time that things can change.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham.
Kyle Peterson: Just wanted to get a little more insight and try to parse out the detail in the 2Q outlook. Obviously, there's a deceleration in growth. Is this due to the kind of volumes on some project work in existing clients? Is it less -- fewer expectations for new logo wins or pushing out price increases? Or is it a little bit of all of that? I just want to get a sense of the puts and takes driving the deceleration that's expected next quarter?
Jason Peterson: Yes. I mean, it would encompass the range of that, right? Certainly, you've got customers, as I referred to earlier, in the travel and hospitality space who are seeing 70%, 90% reduction in their revenues. And those customers are clearly having to make the types of decisions that you would make if you saw that type of reduction in revenues. And so you've got some ramp-downs or sort of need to sort of reduce expense there. We obviously wouldn't have the same sort of pricing ability that we would have in other quarters. But at the same time, we also are seeing some demand increases. And in some cases, we're seeing clients come to us who are maybe having trouble with other vendors and looking for us to sort of support them with both their existing programs and with new programs.
Ark Dobkin: And just to give you like another color like how difficult to answer these questions because there is no simple answer to express like in 1 minute. But let's say, consumer goods or retailers, which one of the industries which is damaged mostly because all stores closed. And the first reaction for them, to save money, and that's what they do in the first reaction. Then second reaction, we need to increase e-commerce. The third reaction, our e-commerce already increased, our systems were not designed for this volume. Can you help? So -- and there's a variety. That's why it is an opportunity from a business standpoint because the most damaging industries actually tomorrow will be the most demanding industries because they will have to prepare ourselves -- themselves. And that's happening as we speak. But again, they need to mitigate a lot right now. Their profitability, usually, like adidas, for example, states that their profitability dropped 95%.
Kyle Peterson: Okay. That's good color. And then I guess just a quick follow-up. You guys noticed, there's a few areas you mentioned in -- that are actually seeing upticks in demand and potential for new logos getting added in this environment. I just want to see if you guys can provide a little more color whether it's -- is that concentrated in specific verticals or specific areas of expertise in delivery that you guys have? Just any more detail that you can provide on the stronger demand in some pockets would be really helpful.
Ark Dobkin: Probably the industry which we will feel better is health care and life science. They're more stable. They understand the demands right now. So at the same time, it's pretty volatile across -- even inside of the industry, depending on the company, we're seeing a little bit longer term versus short term and ability for them to invest right now. We're seeing like some demand coming from the -- exactly, as I mentioned before, industries which is damaged. But they understand in 2 or 3, 4 quarters, they might have very interesting advantages and start to invest now. So it's more like, in some cases, company by company, and -- while clearly travel and hospitality and retail under pressure, and oil and gas, if you will, as well because you understand what's happening in energy right now, too.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo.
Edward Caso: I was wondering if you could talk about any issues with clients around compliance and security challenges with your workforce now remote, if that's impacted any of your demand?
Ark Dobkin: Yes. As I mentioned before, we are preparing for this for some time. We were running special scenarios for business continuity for a long time because that was a key area for us. And so far, we didn't have any issues. We actually have, again, some benefits because it seems like our clients are thinking that we're doing better and some opportunities triggered by that and by some problems across different other vendors. But it's one of the key areas, and I don't think anybody protected here fully.
Edward Caso: And the other question is, do you have sort of a large number of clients beyond the top 20 here? Is there sort of a cleaning of the clients? I mean, are you firing any clients or any dropping off? Are there any sort of credit issues, particularly in the tail of clients?
Jason Peterson: Yes. I would say not from a firing standpoint or anything. And from a credit standpoint, we're trying to be very mindful of sort of credit risk in this environment. And what I would say, if you're referring to the growth rate in the other than top 20, is that we've had very strong growth, particularly in some of the customers in the BIM space, which have increasingly moved up into the top 20 and continue to grow very rapidly. I would say that a lot of our, let's say, other than top 20 are very large global companies that do have sort of large potential wallets. But we do also have a large number of small and midsized companies in the other than top 20. There's a fair concentration of travel and hospitality companies in that space, and we probably have seen some slowdown in those customers, as they obviously sort of recognized that they were seeing a slowdown in their business. And so I don't think it's a trend, but I think you did see a little bit of slowdown in the other than top 20 in Q1 and probably somewhat related to the economic circumstances of the overall sort of global marketplace.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vladimir Bespalov with VTB Capital.
Vladimir Bespalov: I would like to ask you about your working capital evolution. How do you expect this to -- in the coming quarters, do you say it will be quite natural to expect that some clients will progress to delay payment or reduce advance payment? And maybe a little bit more color on the client. If we look at your current business and the business -- compare it with the business as usual, are you losing any clients? Or maybe vice versa, you are gaining more clients just with smaller engagements? Could you provide some color?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So good question. I'll just take the more tactical cash question, and I'll let Ark talk about customers. And so from a cash standpoint, cash collections were pretty strong in Q1 and actually, so far, in Q2, look very solid. But we do expect some slowdown. And as you stated, is that we do have some customers that are looking for sort of temporary payment term extensions, and we do want to be mindful of their business environments. And so I do expect that cash collections would slow down somewhat in Q2. We were over $900 million in cash and cash equivalents in Q1. I would expect that we'll see a modest decrease in our cash position by the end of Q2, and that's probably somewhere in the high 800s. And so again, still a very strong cash position but somewhat lower than in Q1 in part because of the somewhat slower cash collections, as you call out. And I think Ark can talk about customers and kind of what we see from new customers, existing customers kind of...
Ark Dobkin: So can you like -- sorry, to clarify exactly what you're asking about customers like?
Vladimir Bespalov: Basically, my question is, are you losing any customers in general, let's say, more than you usually lose in your regular business? Or maybe you are gaining more customers in the current environment, and the slowdown of the revenue growth is just because of like lower engagement, smaller engagements at the moment. Could you maybe provide some color on this?
Ark Dobkin: So it's very difficult to generalize. I don't think we are losing clients. I think everything would -- other people who are asking if we have some clients starting new projects slower, some clients delaying decisions? Maybe pipeline is not as strong as it was like 1 quarter ago. But in general, there is -- proportionally, it's proportionally kind of across the line, everything happening. And listen, I think the answer: in numbers. I don't know how to bring additional color on this. And I think that would be different in a quarter. And that would be different in a couple of quarters because as we mentioned, volatility across client base is very high right now. Some of them are very active, some of them under-reactive even to the situation. So we will see what will be happening with the next quarter or two.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Michael Yang with Susquehanna.
Michael Yang: I just had a quick question about your business media and information services vertical. And I know you guys had said that this is a particularly strong vertical, but I had heard from a number of competitors that this was actually under pressure because of ad budget compression. So I was wondering if you could speak about the dynamics there.
Ark Dobkin: Compressions?
Jason Peterson: Ad budget compression.
Ark Dobkin: Okay. Yes. So far, it feels more normal. So -- and also, telco and media are so -- like it's also pretty different businesses in some respect like. And in our case, it's the same category. Clearly, telco is right now having a lot of growth opportunities. So -- but so far, it's performed for us relatively well.
Jason Peterson: Yes. And still looks good in Q2 as well. So I don't think we're seeing quite what was described.
Ark Dobkin: Because in addition to just advertisement, all of them considering a huge number of opportunities to provide online services and new type of services as well. Some of -- nobody from us even was thinking about it like a couple of months ago.
Operator: At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back to Ark Dobkin, CEO and President, for closing remarks.
Ark Dobkin: Thank you, everybody. Again, sorry for some technical problems with our provider for the call, and it seems like you didn't hear part of message which was delivered. So I think David will comment on this after me. So -- but thank you for joining. Yes, it's a different time. So we went already, in our history, through multiple recessions. So -- and when we're thinking about -- I'm thinking about this, it seems like it was relatively long period of problems when I was refreshing my memory and looking in the specifics. It usually was maximum for two quarters, and then we were seeing demand coming back. It's very difficult to say if the same pattern would happen here. It is a different type of crisis. But I think it's pretty obvious that this type of crisis is actually putting on digital services very, very different demand. And this is the core of our business. And all we're doing right now, preparing ourselves for comeback. That's the goal #1. And this is a talent, and this is financial stability on the exit of this. And I think on both of this, we're doing pretty well. So with this, I'll come -- yes.
David Straube: So as Ark mentioned, we did have some technical challenges with the initial replay of our call. The entire replay will be available on our Investors section within the next hour. I want to thank you for your patience and your time today.
Ark Dobkin: Thank you.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-20 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the EPAM Systems Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.
David Straube: Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's fourth quarter 2019 results. If you have not, a copy is available at epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President, and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investor section of our website. With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With our recent Investor and Analyst Day in November 2019, we spend some time speaking about the challenges our customers face, while improving productivity to speeding up business results in an increasingly competitive environment. We talked about the necessity for most of our customers to transform themselves into adaptive enterprises, because the way we see it adaptiveness is a key puzzle that must be solved in order to compete effectively. And in turn to be the best partner to our clients and help them solve the challenges. We understand that EPAM needs to be a fast global and highly adaptive organization itself. Well, obviously, most of our competitors have also been talking about transforming into modern [ph] players. We try to explain work in November, why recently EPAM is already fully adoption or distributed agile delivery models and close collaboration, so I have three teams in product centric engineering practices is positioned better than most to be successful in solving the corresponding challenges. And that we are planning to do to make sure those goals are not just words, but the direction for an actionable efforts and practical investments. Now three months later, we can share our full year financial results as well as revisit several points we talked with you about back in November. We finished 2019 in strong fiscal position across several dimensions in our business. Financially, we landed at $2,290,000 in revenues reflecting 25% year-over-year constant currency growth. And non-GAAP earnings per share were $5.42, the 23% increase over fiscal 2018. Additionally, we generated $188 million of free cash flow for the year. On the people front, we added 6500 addition to our EPAM headcount across our client facing teams and corporate functions. Also, in 2019, we were focused on extending our client engagement configurators through more of our sales and account management functions and establish a comprehensive consulting culture. We launched EPAM Continuum, our brand that integrates our capabilities and business technology and experienced consultant. EPAM Continuum along with our core product engineering capabilities brings to the market an integrated approach to solving complex problems, by engaging a team of practitioners that can respond across multiple organizational touchpoints to help our clients address the challenges of the adaptive enterprise to meet an objective [ph]. In addition to launching our consultant pushing forward, we also saw an increased demand for companies that truly understand how to build differentiated business platforms, how to best of breed components connected through intelligent APIs. We have seen this component built strategy gained more traction in the market as enterprises start to orient away from few of the shelf models towards more product centric go to market and solution strategies, which is very much in line with a prediction made five years ago by a leading analyst organization, who stated that by 2020, 75% of digital enterprise applications will be built versus buy [ph]. They also clarified that their research shows that many companies already favor a new kind of build that doesn't include out-of-the-box solution, instead a combination of application components, that are differentiated, innovative, and non-standard software, as well as a highly customized solutions will be increasingly adapted. We sync our product engineering D&A really help us to become five years ago much more relevant in terms of market because of these trends. We believe that this intelligent component build capabilities will become even more important beyond 2020 as speed and differentiation pressures continues to push our customers to change the way they look their technology, business processes and organizations. That is why in 2019, we expanded the number of our strategic partnership relationship to go far beyond of just formal understanding of those critical components and create valuable usable accelerators and very much advanced level of engineering expertise around them for increased speed and reliability of this complex and differentiating build solutions. This specifically covers such components in our cloud first automation data and engagement practices. In 2019, in addition to building our capabilities organically, we continued our strategy of targeted competency driven acquisitions to support our practices in data, dev test cycles, and our growing consulting opportunities, which expanded our expertise in cloud data integration, AI-based and SaaS cloud sourcing test and analytics. Just to name a few. We also diversified our global presence, both from client and delivery perspective and operate now in more than 30 countries. We often speak about our efforts around education and training is one of the key drivers for future scalability. We have always done this for both internal and external audiences in terms of our current and future employees. But 2019 became a very important year for us because we took our education capabilities to a new level of professionalism and now ready for the next level of investment in the area is much more confidence than in the past. Last year through our learning platform, EPAM University and a variety of boot camps and [indiscernible] and development efforts impacted more than 10,000 people, engage and develop our own talent and train new experts in our core delivery markets. And its growth effort from launching our pilot master's in software engineering program in Eastern Europe to extend an hour, CSR education efforts across 19 countries to reach more kids than ever before. Both in 2019, we brought our experience in developing and delivering integrated and interactive assessments and training platform to our clients. If you remember, at some point, we share it a brief case study with an automotive client who trusted us to deliver a program for the employees. They are happy to share that last week, EPAM was one of only 10 companies out of 400 that was recognized in Daimler [ph] groups, global suppliers. The Innovation Award was presented to EPAM for the program tailored to the Daimler IT team for helping them to transform their organization, digital knowledge. Now to conclude on 2019 and to reach into 2020. With all of these initiatives in mind, in 2020, we will continue to focus our investment into real programs that supports our ability to execute our growth strategy. As you can see, some programs began in 2019. But when you will focus on making continuous and sometimes significant upgrades, including consultant in industry expertise, people developmental education and engagement, I think it's also important to remind that being in engineering driven company is still a key area of focus for us. And we would like to stay firmly ahead of the competition. In addition to the education and training activities mentioned before, this also includes our investments in open sourced best engineering productivity tools, as well as internal global delivery and infrastructure platforms that we are continuing to expand and evolve, to provide a higher level of collaboration, knowledge management, and deep understanding of our internal and external talent, basically making those platforms even more comprehensive and intelligent to support the speed and skill they need. I think to conclude my part, I will provide a brief summary of our ambitions for 2020. The ability to transform ourselves into adaptive enterprise, real key to driving our future success. And we understand that we need to continue to disrupt ourselves in the world at accelerated pace to make it happen. Together, we need to become one of the best in the world in innovation and design consultant, education and social responsibility, while continuing to strengthen our core engineering capabilities. So, we'll have to continuously invest in adapting our people platforms and processes into those that quickly respond to change, leveraging our existing global indices, distributed delivery environment to build and bring to life the EPAM digital platforms that connect our people and enables them to work seamlessly, making us more efficient and effective in all that we do. Opening opportunities for transformation for everyone, anywhere through next-gen delivery as well as educational, social, innovation programs. And lastly, extending our leadership across integrated consultant and engineering. We realize that this ambitious goal and the growth goals before us are even more challenging as we become a more global complex and dynamic organization. So, our investments continued to be focused and we continued to stress our ability to see and respond to change as a core values it goes back to EPAM early days. With all of this in mind, and despite some of the macro level uncertainties, we are constantly watching, and we are looking at 2020 optimistically. We believe that we can continue to remain relevant to our global and diverse client base through our ability to execute large scale digital transformation program and help them with their ambitions, innovation programs [ph]. I will turn it over to Jason for detailed financial update of last year and our guidance for 2020.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our fourth quarter financial highlights. All with industry vertical performance and then touch on a few operational highlights, ending with guidance for fiscal year 2020 and Q1. Revenue for Q4 came in at 632.8 million, a year-over-year growth of 25.3% on a reported basis or 24.8% growth in constant currency, reflecting a positive foreign exchange impact and 0.5%. We saw higher than expected revenue for Q4 driven substantially by an uptick in demand in the second half of the quarter, as well as stronger performance from a few of our acquired companies. In the FX benefit due to the strengthening Russian ruble. Growth in the quarter was broad based across our client portfolio. Some of the trends in growth include customer engagement, ecommerce re-platforming, scaling new models to drive client's future growth, product and platform engineering and application modernization, regulatory activity, data and data analytics and education. Looking at our fourth quarter revenue growth across our industry verticals, Software and Hi-Tech grew 24.5% in the quarter. Financial Services delivered 21.8% growth, Life Sciences and Healthcare grew 20.3% in the quarter, reflecting a tougher year-over-year comparison given the exceptionally strong performance in Q4 FY2018. And Travel and Consumer grew 15.9%. Rounding out our vertical performance, we saw a very strong growth in both business information and media which posted growth of 38% and our emerging vertical which delivered 36.3% growth driven primarily by clients in telecommunications, and energy. From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region representing 60.1% of our Q4 revenues grew 22.2% year-over-year. Europe representing 32.7% of our Q4 revenues grew 31.4% year-over-year plus 31.7% in constant currency. CIS representing 4.9% of our Q4 revenues grew 39.7% year-over-year and 27.7% in constant currency. And finally, APAC grew 5.4% and now represents 2.3% of our revenues. In the fourth quarter, growth in our top 20 clients was approximately 22.1% and growth outside of our top 20 clients was approximately 27.7% compared to the same quarter last year. Moving on the income statement, our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35.2% compared to 36.8% in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 36.7% compared to 37.7% for the same quarter last year. GAAP SG&A was 19.8% of revenue compared to 19.3% in Q4 of last year, and non-GAAP SG&A came in at 18.1% of revenue compared to 17.7% in the same period last year. SG&A in Q4 reflected investments to create new capabilities, expand infrastructure and introduce new lines of business. GAAP income from operations was $84.7 million or 13.4% of revenue in the quarter compared to $78.3 million or 15.5% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $107.6 million or 17% of revenue in the quarter, compared to $93.1 million or 18.4% of revenue in Q4 of last year. The year-over-year comparisons for both gross margin and income from operations reflect a lower level of utilization as a result of our decision to increase the rate of headcount additions in the second half of fiscal year 2019. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 12.1%, which includes a higher than expected level of excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes the excess tax benefit was 20.7%. In Q4, both GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were favorably impacted by one-time adjustments related to prior years. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.29 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.51, reflecting an 18.9% increase over the same quarter in fiscal 2018. In Q4, there were approximately 58 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operations for Q4 was $124.6 million, compared to $123.1 million in the same quarter for FY2018. In Q4 FY2018, DSO improved by eight days versus a three-day improvement in Q4 FY2019. Free cash flow was $77.6 million compared to $113 million in the same quarter last year, resulting in an 88.9% conversion of adjusted net income. DSO was 72 days compared to 75 days at the end of Q3 fiscal 2019 and 73 days in the same quarter last year. The lower than average DSO this quarter was the result of our ongoing operational focus in this area. Moving on to a few operational metrics, we ended the quarter with more than 32,500 delivery professionals a 21.7% increase year-over-year and a net addition of more than 1000 production professionals during Q4. Our total headcount ended at more than 36,700 employees. Utilization was 77.9% compared to 80.2% in the same quarter last year and 76.1% in Q3. Turning to the results for fiscal 2019 revenues for the fiscal year closed at $2.29 billion or 24.5% reported growth over 2018 for a constant currency growth of 25.8%. During fiscal 2019 our acquisitions contributed approximately 1.5% total growth. GAAP income from operations increased 23.2% year-over-year and represented 13.2% of revenue for the year. Our non-GAAP income from operations was 389.2 million an increase of 23.5% over the prior year and represented 17% of revenue. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the year came in at 12.8% excluding the impact of the excess tax benefits and certain onetime adjustments. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21.8%. Diluted earnings per share on a gap basis were $4.53. Non-GAAP EPS, which excludes adjustments for stock-based compensation. Acquisition related costs was $5.42 reflecting a 23.7% increase over fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2019, there were approximately $57.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. In fiscal 2019, cash flow from operations was $287.5 million compared to 292.2 million for fiscal 2018 and free cash flow came in at $188.1 million reflecting a 60.2% adjusted net income conversion. Now let's turn to guidance, starting with fiscal 2020. Revenue growth will be in excess of 22% for both reported and constant currency. Inorganic contribution for the full year is expected to be approximately 1%. We expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13% to 14% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 14% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be at least $5.56 for the full year and non-GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $6.30 for the full year. Expect weighted average share account at $58.8 million fully diluted shares outstanding. The Q1 of FY2020, revenues will be at least $642 million for the first quarter, producing a growth rate of at least 23% for both reported and constant currency. For the first quarter, we gap income from operations to be in the range of 12% to 13%, in non-GAAP operations to be in the range of 15% to 16%. We expect our gap effective tax rate to be approximately 5% and non-GAAP effective tax rate will be approximately 23%. Earnings per share we expect GAAP dilutive EPS will be at least $1.27 for the quarter and non-GAAP EPS will be at least $1.36 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 58.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock compensation expenses are expecting to be approximately $74 million with $18 million in Q1, $17 million in Q2 and $19 million in the remaining quarters. Amortization and intangibles is expected to be approximately 11 million for the year evenly spread across each quarter. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $9 million loss for the year spread evenly across each quarter. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $20.5 million for the year with a $5.3 million in Q1 and approximately $5.1 million in each remaining quarter. We expect excess tax benefits to be around $34 million for the full year with approximately $14.5 million Q1, $9.5 million in Q2 and $5 million in each remaining quarter. One last point on our business outlook, we expect the profitability profile of fiscal 2020 to be more similar to that experienced in fiscal 2018 with lower utilization and profitability in the first half of the year, with improvements in the second half of the year. So, in summary, our 2020 outlook reflects continued strong demand for our services underpinned by the diverse set of industries we serve, which provide EPM with a broad range of growth opportunities. Our investments across our people, platforms and processes will equip and position EPAM for future growth. With that, let's open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Margaret Nolan with William Blair. Please proceed.
Margaret Nolan: Thank you. Good morning. Jason wanted to follow-up on that last comment kind of the cadence of the year the first half versus the second half. What is contributing to that lower utilization and profitability in 1H and why is it going to improve in the second half of the year?
Jason Peterson: Sure. So, the traditional pattern for the company has been higher profitability in the first half and lower profitability in the second half. In 2018, we ran with that very high utilization in Q1, which is, which was 80%. And we don't expect to run at that level utilization in Q1. And I'll talk about a couple things. So, first, we've got fewer available bill days in the first half of the fiscal year than we have in the second half. So that generally has more buildings, has a positive impact on profitability. The other thing is we've got some impacts in Q1, I think most of us will be aware of payroll taxes kicked back into the extent that they've been capped in certain geographies, particularly the U.S. and Russia. They're uncapped as you start Q1. So that has a significant impact on costs in the first quarter relative to Q4. The other thing we have our significant amount of our compensation increases actually occur in Q2. And so, both of those impacts tend to have a somewhat toward moderating impact on profitability. When we get into the second half, we've got greater bill days, we begin to see more capping of the payroll taxes. In generally, what we expect to see is that - we're going to keep an eye on utilization with a focus on keeping that around the range where we're at now with some potential for improvement.
Margaret Nolan: Okay, great. Thank you. And then Arkadiy, you talked about continuing to be and that adaptability is important. So, I'm wondering as you think about that concept is there a risk here that certain initiatives would cannibalize other opportunities that you already have in place? For instance, the education capabilities and services does that ever cannibalize your opportunity for other services with clients? How should we think about kind of that changing dynamic as you are an increasingly more adaptable organization?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Hopefully, when people talking about it, it means that we're trying to improve speed to market. Basically, what well - what changes our clients experiencing, we will be able to change our [indiscernible] to help being in specific value and doing this fast. So, I don't think it's about typically one over another, like our educational service is not really compete what [indiscernible] our core capabilities. So, because from our point-of-view when you educate clients so you can eventually work with this client much more efficiently and improve overall speed. That's a real goal for us to, University of this area [ph] for example. And for any specific example, probably we can use similar explanation [ph].
Margaret Nolan: Okay. Understood. Thank you.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Hi Ark. Hi, Jason. Congratulations on the good quarter. I wanted to start this relative question. I wanted to start as well with a question on margin. So is the incremental push into consulting. Also affecting the margin profile this year or has that become part of the baseline at this point. And as consulting business, should that affect your traditional financial model affect the ability to win larger deals? Do you expect certain newer target for on-site percentage any of those granular comments would be great?
Jason Peterson: Yes, I don't think that the consulting business itself has a specific impact on profitability or the model. And so, I think it'd be the same answer we've talked about. It's a modest evolution while it may somewhat take up the onsite percentage, it's not going - that's not what showing up in, let's say, profitable the year-over-year. From a 2019 to 2020 bridge standpoint, which I think is the question you're asking about, we feel that we really need to continue to make investments in the business to continue to grow the company at a rate in excess of 20%. And so, I think one of the real advantages of EPAM's strategy or kind of direction overtime has been to continue to evolve the business. I think we've all seen companies that maybe offer the same service of product and then overtime that offering goes stale. EPAM has continued to open all of its offerings and I think that's why the company continues to grow at this industry leading organic constant currency growth rate. We are beginning and this is maybe a little bit of new information, but we are beginning to think about what it means to be a much bigger company. So, as we exit this fiscal year 2020, we're guiding towards something approaching $3 billion in revenue. And we're already as we look at our success in the market and our position in a fast-growing market, we are beginning to think about what it means to be a company that generates $5 billion in revenue. And so, we are trying to make sure that we're making the necessary investments and taking the evolutionary steps that support our longer-term growth towards a bigger company.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Got it. That's good to hear. And the cadence revenue growth, it seemed to me that there isn't necessarily a [indiscernible] it should continue to be a steady, no 20's, hopefully approaching mid-20's type of growth. Would you agree with that? Or that incremental comments that you might provide?
Jason Peterson: So, maybe clarify that you're saying it doesn't appear or that it does appear? I'm not.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: I'm asking for the cadence of revenue growth. What you look you expect it looks to me like the normal year from revenue growth perspective?
Jason Peterson: Yes, so I use the language to exceed 22%, which is slightly different than at least and that was intentional. And so yes, we continue to feel good about the demand environment and continue to expect to grow revenue, certainly in excess of 27. Sort of, yes, so as I said, started to exceed 22% growth rate.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey Alesol [ph] with Barclays. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give a little color on the reacceleration and growth in the Travel and Consumer segment, just talk about drivers there.
Jason Peterson: So, we had seen a slowdown in that segment, and it was across couple of customers. And so, one was a North American retailer. And the other to be honest was a range of retail and consumer goods customers in UK and in Europe. And what we're beginning to see is we think a certain degree of stabilization in the UK market. And then at the same time, we're beginning to see what we think could be some really interesting opportunities in the branded consumer goods space. And so, I think you're seeing some, I think you're still going to be in something south of 20% growth rate in the coming quarter, but you're beginning to see some improvement because we see some stabilization and we're beginning to get some interesting new opportunities in branded consumer goods.
Unidentified Analyst: That's great. And maybe that dovetails into my follow-up question, which is given the geographic diversity, you guys called out, can you give us your general read on the demand environment? Are you seeing I mean, it sounded like the things in the UK at least for you, maybe looking good at specific segment, any impacts you're seeing from geopolitical issues? Obviously, we have, from developments in Asia with Coronavirus or other situations. What's your general view of the global kind of demand environment?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we're trying to share our view is our kind of guidance for 2020. So, at the same time, there is some level of unpredictability which I guess we will understand, like for example, which is happening in APAC right now. There is some direct, but very minimum impact which we're seeing at this point, but indirectly, who knows what will be happening within the next couple of quarters. And even specifically on this market which Jason mentioned, like retail and luxury goods, because that might be the most vulnerable part of our market. So - but in general as we mentioned, we're looking at this pretty optimistically. We said like we want to be exceeding 22% growth, which is pretty optimistic view, I think.
Jason Peterson: So again, we continue to strong growth in West Coast hi-tech. We've had extremely strong growth in business information median. And we expect to see that type of growth in the future. Continue to see exciting opportunities in clients that we're not doing business within the life sciences and health care space. And then from a Europe standpoint, what we continue to see is that slowdown in European banking demand. But we've got a lot of interesting demand and things like Neobanks, payments we've talked about. As we've said before, insurance is growing very rapidly. So, excited about those opportunities. And now I'm going to take one quick opportunity to remind people of the European growth rate. And so, we talked about this and I just want to make certain that it's still in people's minds is that we have a large customer that has been a historic EPAM customer in the business information and media space. And it's split into two customers. And when it split into two customers, one half of the businesses is now the decision making is out of the UK. And so that customer then became a European customer. And it was not a European customer in 2018. And so, we've had very strong growth in that particular business and information media customer. The growth rate in Europe would have been 20% in Q4, without the change in that customer. And the growth rate in North America would have been somewhat higher, if that kind of geographic reclassification has not occurred.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks so much. Super helpful.
Jason Peterson: You bet. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Jason Kupferberg: Hey, good morning, guys. How are you?
Jason Peterson: Good. Good. Thanks.
Jason Kupferberg: So, just wanted to start with kind of a high-level question around just when we think of trade-offs between growth and margins as a general theme, where do you guys stand on that? I mean, do you think it's plausible to have both accelerating top-line growth and margin expansion simultaneously or are we always going to generally be in more of a trade-off status between those two. And I asked this because it looks like maybe, 2020 is a case in point where top-line forecast looks terrific. You talked about some of the investments that you need to make and some of the utilization dynamics. So, maybe margins are going to be kind of flat to down. So just wanted to see how you're thinking about that on a longer-term, conceptual basis. And then if you can detail some of the reinvestments, a little bit more for 2020. That would be great. Thanks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it's - the whole life was a trade-off. So, the same growth and profitability. So, I think growth for us is a primary goal. But profitability is a very important factor. And I think it's good in ways. And you're right like we're talking about specific investments because we go and like if you send back like - eight years ago when we did IPO. So, it was one company with very different profiles than today. It was like $300 million plus company today, we are approaching $3 billion. So, and obviously this investment is very simple, simple statement, investments changing necessary. I think we were talking about it all the time. And we were actually performing on this. And we saw volatility in our profitability as well. So, I think, as you mentioned 2020 for us, we will be investment here. We saw it actually, last year will be investment year as well, but we were able to run better than we expected. Q4 actually when we started to invest because we feel that we can do it. And Q1 and further will be continued. It's very difficult and I know might be not exactly what everybody wants to hear, but it's very difficult to predict exactly result of this. And that's why we're looking at this directionally and quarter-by-quarter what we will need to do and how we will need to change. If you're talking about specific investment, I think we tried to highlight those specifically. We're talking about consultancy, very important, we’re talking about our traditional investment in engineering quality because that's a kind of scale on our operation and our differentiation. We are talking about education because it's a scalability from one point of view and improving productivity relationship with clients from another point of view. And we're talking about digital platforms because we become public again eight years ago with 7000 people, now we - this year, we will be approaching 40,000 people. So, we need to think how to turn ourselves to potentially in the near future to $5 billion revenue company. So, probably a little bit more extended answers and may be even [indiscernible] answers and you would anticipate but that’s the reflection of reality of respect [ph].
Jason Kupferberg: Yeah, that's very helpful. Just a quick follow-up, I think this growth in the top five customers accelerated. And I was just wondering whether there was any change in the composition of those top five clients and is this exit rate for 2019 in that top five buckets expected to be sustainable in 2020.
Arkadiy Dobkin: That is a very natural competition across our clients to be number one, number two, number three. So, there are some changes. Okay. Jason also mentioned that one of our top clients split in two and both of them continuously grow and one of them very aggressively. So, I think there is no real changes in top five, but in total, but I mean like the position of each of them going down and up, dependent on even quarters or years. And clearly there are some new faces in our top 10 and top 20.
Jason Kupferberg: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please proceed.
Bryan Bergin: Good morning. Thank you. Wanted to ask on the NAYA Tech integration, can you give us some detail there, it sounds like the contribution may even stronger than you expected.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Hey, it was a little bit stronger than we expected but it's also in kind of the same range, some of them, and it is very new for us, it just second quarter I believe, when it's happening. So, it's too early. And one good project, good - and this is relatively small deal. So, one big project can change the whole parameters. So, I think it's doing better than we anticipated. And I think it would be good in 12 months to talk about it, but it's kind of very much in line it is our expectation on capabilities point of view and what is bringing to us and how it has helped us.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. And then just to follow up on margin here, so can you talk about how you think about longer term SG&A leverage potential. I get the sense you're making the investments here now as you think about the needs of a 5 billion revenue entity, but assuming relatively stable gross margin levels, just curious how we should be thinking about the model from the ability to drive leverage elsewhere.
Jason Peterson: Yeah, so, what we've been guiding to is this kind of 18% to 19% range on SG&A as a percentage of revenue, and I think probably in 2020, and maybe even into the next year, you'll continue to see the type of investments that it takes to transform and make EPAM be adaptive organization, or the increasingly adaptive organization that are prefer to. I think that's probably, maybe a multiyear cycle with an opportunity for some improvement, potentially, after that. So, as I said, it's kind of goes in waves. So, I think this is going to be a bit of an investment year, you might still see some more of that in 2021. And then as we continue to ramp revenue at a $5 billion company you do have a potential to sort of look at and readjust your model.
Bryan Bergin: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Surinder Thind: Good morning, gentlemen. Just a quick question on terms of just generally the way that you guys are thinking about revenues and guidance, are there any risks or things that you've accounted for your guidance related to maybe, let's say election related activity in the U.S., depending in how that race unfolds? Or are there other events or things that we should be thinking about that might potentially impact the numbers there - especially in the part -
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don't think - I don't think we're thinking about election impact when we're talking about -and if you're talking about election, it's also very difficult questions then we neglect to think about elections in very many geographies as well. But we generally clearly looking at our experience and political situations in different geographies with ways to now understand an experience of the past.
Surinder Thind: That's helpful.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, the visibility continues to be in the - let's call it the 80% to 90% range. We've guided, as Ark said, with our assessment of the near-term kind of direct impact of what's going on in Asia Pac. So, we have kind of modelled a little bit of a slowdown in our business at Hong Kong and China. We haven't necessarily modelled a more substantial sort of global growth slowdown. But we clearly have been kind of prudent and we - David and I spent a lot of time doing sort of channel checks and working with each of the individual business units. And consistent with what I said with one of your earlier questions is we continue to see very strong demand in the life science and health care space. We continue to see interesting and very exciting opportunities in IoT. We've got a whole series of different types of financial services opportunities that are outside of the traditional kind of banking environment, which is why you see our financial services practices performed the way it does relative to maybe some of our peers. We continue to see that very strong growth that we've talked about in business information and media. And so again, and then finally we continue to have a lot of growth and our west coast high tech clients. And so, we feel good about the business. And again, the thing that I think I'm always comforted by is that our demand is broad based across a wide range of industry verticals are not dependent on growth from one or two customers or one specific vertical to make our 22% - in excess of 22% growth rate.
Surinder Thind: That's helpful. And then in terms of just kind of thinking about your cash levels. I guess there's some talk about M&A for a while now. Any additional color you can provide there in terms of pipelines or the quality of targets that are out there? Is it simply that you guys are having a challenge finding the right fit - the right cultural fit, the right group of people or is there some valuation issue considerations here? How should we think about your M&A stuff?
Jason Peterson: It probably could be all of the above. But I think that for us, we have done I think a larger number of kinds of smaller acquisitions in fiscal year 2019. There is more open mindedness based on some of the success that we've had with those acquisitions or deals that could be of a somewhat larger size. And I think you might see some of that in 2020. But as you've indicated, I think our most important filter really is this sort of cultural fit, whether it's a business, it's going to bring something to EPAM and whether the management team is still motivated and is excited about the opportunity to join EPAM and continue to grow our collective organizations. And so, a lot of times I think that's probably the filter where we sort of might step away from a transaction. Because we want to make certain bet that the fit is good, and it is going to produce positive outcomes for the employees of both companies.
Surinder Thind: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, guys. This is Andrew [ph] on behalf of Darrin. Wanted to home in on the account cohorts with regards to the revenue size. Look, the 57% growth you saw in 2019 and the $20 million plus is really impressive. I guess I'm trying to parse out, what is the clients that are just graduating from the lower tiers and versus incremental wins. And then my follow-up will be, the platform strategy over the last couple of years is clearly working in the market. And how should we think about the spend curve with regards to the second derivative of spend within those accounts, be it in the product development technology and engineering, offerings you guys have.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Can you go with the first question?
Jason Peterson: I'd go with the first. So, in the case of the - I guess the transition of the cohorts is that, it's kind of a combination of things as well. We've talked about over time where we do have, you know many of our clients who may, may look small on our charts are actually, you know, large global corporations that have significant opportunities for EPAM and we continue to grow inside those opportunities. So, what we've always talked about is we grow from existing relationships and we also grow due to the introduction of new relationships. So, you've got some of growth within companies that have been EPAM customers for period of years. Then what you also have is a couple of companies where you've had this real rapid growth. We talked about the business information and media in Europe. We've also had some, another very significant grower and the business information and media space in the United States. And so, it's kind of a combination of a couple of new customers and this growth. So, hopefully that answers that question. And then Ark?
Arkadiy Dobkin: And the second question, if I understand correctly, it was about our involvement in building platform. Is that correct?
Unidentified Analyst: Yeah, that's right. I mean it just obviously that seems to be the tip of the spear and in some circumstances. And I'm just curious on how that, how you've seen that translate into incremental spend in the other offerings that you have and for those clients?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Well, first of all, we definitely have ambition to be kind of main orchestrator for these types of programs when clients need it. And I think we were explaining is that we do believe that we have right experience, the right capabilities for this specifically coming from our product engineering background initially and then helping kind of digital reborn companies to build internal products, internal platforms. So, I understand their needs for scalability and flexibility and complexity of this. And that's what we are actually trying to put together, the right orchestration level from consultancy, from business perspective to technology and experience perspective and be very strong engineers to do it. And I think that works for us because a portion of these type of deals is increasing and we see in, it is strong demand for these capabilities specifically in more traditional corporate market where people has to move to this direction to protect the land each day. So, I don't know exactly what you tried to extend, but I think is proportionally increasing part of our business and basically our main goal, how to become a leader in this space.
Unidentified Analyst: No, that's helpful. Congratulations on another impressive year. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Arvind Ramnani with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Arvind Ramnani: Just a quick question on here, given your expanded services and consulting, are you're seeing increased visibility and downstream revenues and, and also with this increased consulting, are you seeing a different set of competitors?
Arkadiy Dobkin: We see significant change in competitor's landscape because we were like all our larger players, they have multifunctional areas and we were competing with them just in different segments, but now we compete in more kind of value chain component of this as well. And visibility is a very difficult, difficult question. We clearly now getting into the programs where we potentially see opportunities from a different perspective that we make an impact on the client in different perspective. So, if it's giving us a better predictability based on the numbers, you can see that we probably in a very similar position as before, but my addressable market and now scale is increasing. So, I think it's proportionally working well for us because all this capability improvement and all investments which we’re doing, it's confirming our ability to grow 20 plus percent. That's the point.
Arvind Ramnani: Great. And certainly, your guidance is very strong for 2020. But I wanted to clarify, is that all organic is any inorganic component to what you're guiding to?
Jason Peterson: Yeah, no, that's a great question. And so, again, what we're saying is, we will exceed 22% growth, which as I said earlier, is slightly different language and intentional versus the at least we've used in the past. And we believe about based on the acquisitions that we have today about 1% would be from the inorganic kind of component. And then just kind of reconfirming the profitability guidance in the 16% to 17% range that we intend to operate in the range, rather than at the top of the range the way we did in 2019.
Arvind Ramnani: Perfect. Good luck for 2020
Jason Peterson: Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Friedman, with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed.
James Friedman: Hi, thank you. And let me echo the congratulations. I just wanted to ask two things. Ark, in your prepared remarks, you really were emphasizing the product development conversation, I realized that is been core to the company since your origins but when you made the comment that your clients are more interested in building versus buying their technology, I was just hoping you could frame that in the context of the cloud. I'm sorry to ask that but is like our clients building more because of the cloud or is there something else going on? And then let me just ask my second one, get it out of the way. The fixed price did increase as a percentage of revenue and it's higher now than I can remember. Is that due to the same thing? Or is there something else going on there? So, the…
Jason Peterson: Let me answer the easier question first, which is fixed fee. And I'll let Ark deal with the complicated topics. And so, the increase is primarily due to growth in a couple of larger accounts, where we've got these fee structures that are that adjust based on team size. And so, there's kind of a fixed monthly fee based on the composition of the team. If the team size changes up or down, it changes the fixed monthly fee. And that's why you're seeing this sort of shift towards higher sort of fixed fee, but it's not a classic multiyear fixed fee where we committed to do something for $20 million over a time period, so it's much less risky. And again, if in month two, the team size is taken up, then the fixed fee goes up. So, it's I would call kind of a subtle variant on a time and materials, but we've chosen to classify it as fix fee.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yeah, on the first part of the question. So, build versus buy. So, I think this kind of direction started to become much more visible when companies started to compete not on efficiency of the workload separation, but on the efficiency of engagement engine basically. Consumer or client-oriented part of the digital ecosystem. And when you go into your clients and compete for this market, you need to differentiate ourselves much, much stronger than [indiscernible] on the efficiency style. So ideally, both parts would be very well coordinated. And finally started to talk about the important of this system of engagement, differentiation, flexibility and constant update. Times it goes, that's what I mentioned like this report from 2015. So, and when is happening then you can adjust use a standard enterprise package software, you have to customize it to very big extent and sometimes this customization even doesn't make sense. So, you need to like to utilize multiple components and you build in the system and this platform correctly then you neglect to integrate this component in such a way to be replaceable because technology changing in next couple years, this component will be obsolete and somebody will get an advantage. And that's what we're talking about when we mentioned built versus buy. So, nothing new, but to do it you need to have a very strong engineering product, engineering with route. It's not just configuration, it's not just switching some check boxes. So, and I think, why the way performance - the way we perform during the last multiple like years was due to this engineering capabilities and we don't want to lose it. But we also need an additional one because differentiation is also coming from experience and from business models. And all of this together for us is a built.
James Friedman: Got it. Thank you, both.
Jason Peterson: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question for today comes from Joseph Foresi, with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.
Joseph Foresi: Hi, I'll make sure it's short given how long the call is. Just a couple of quick ones, one, we talk a lot about the verticals that are doing well, but I'm curious what transformation product or what transformation areas are customers most interested in these days. I know when digital began, it was a lot about the consumer. But I'm wondering what you're doing from sort of a product development perspective. And then I have just one quick follow-up.
Arkadiy Dobkin: This is a big question, which I don't know how to answer in kind of 30 seconds or two minutes, because unfortunately, the answer would be very, very generic and we will be talking about analytics and data and potentially IT and cloud. So basically, the answer will be too generic in this term, unless we have real conversation.
Joseph Foresi: So, let me ask it a different way. Has the type of transformation changed since you were $300 million company and my follow-up would be are you finding the proper skill sets for that type of change?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I assume from $300 million company to current state, then it answers will be very similar to what I was given like several minutes ago because this notion of system of engagements. And when we were $300 million company, we were mostly product engineering extension for our clients versus right now we're building the core solutions where we are bringing this differentiation. And that's why on top of engineering skills, we need all this additional lap. And that's the main driver and the main goal for us to bring value there. So, that's the biggest difference, incorporating all this new technology as we change it, like very quickly.
Joseph Foresi: Got it. And then do you feel like you have the skill set, particularly on the outer edges where you're looking at more…
Arkadiy Dobkin: And that's part of this wave and this is part of the training because that's why we're talking about education. And my typical answer during all these quarters was now there is not enough skills, but we are finding the way how to train and build them because we also very interested in fundamental knowledge of our employees. So, it's not just people who train for three months on something, we have a talent which we're able to retrain or direct, direct in right kind of area to get new skills. And again, this is back to our educational training purposes.
Joseph Foresi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So, I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional concluding comments.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, thank you. Thank you, everybody. As usual, we’re pleased with our 2019 results. We continue to grow; we confirm in our ability to grow at the extent of 20%. And thank you to your support and thank you to all of our 36,000 people globally and let’s talk in three months. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Again, we thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-07 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the EPAM Systems Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. David Straube, Head of Investor Relations for EPAM Systems. You may begin.
David Straube: Thank you, Operator, and welcome, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2019 results. If you have not, a copy is available at epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investor section of our website. With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We delivered net revenue of $588 million, reflecting an approximate 26% year-over-year growth or 27% in constant currency terms. Additionally, non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.39, which represents approximately 19% growth from Q3 of 2018. As we have discussed in the past, the challenges facing our clients continue to be complex and multidimensional. The digital ecosystem where everything is coming together, including people, suppliers, consumers and businesses into a scalable and flexible environment brings with it a completely different level of sophistication in designing, building and delivering dynamic experiences, platforms and systems. And while many companies have invested in digital technologies across a very diverse landscape of system of record engagements and insights, the use of technology to solve currently visible problems doesn't ensure a future success. Instead organizations must think steps ahead and turn themselves into constantly changing adaptive enterprises by empowering these capabilities in properly designed and well-built digital ecosystems. This means that our clients must think about how to meet the challenges addressed in their marketplace and the opportunities as well as how to adapt to both technology and constant organizational changes and do so with a high degree of agility, which continues to be very critical. As a result, during the last several years and present Q3, we have seen a consistent demand environment that continues to present us with opportunities to expand from our traditional product engineering and technology-led lines of businesses into adjacent business- and experience-driven areas of customer needs. That, in turn, has forced us not only to advance our consulting offerings but to bring those capabilities much earlier in the engagement cycles in comparison to what we did just several years ago. This evolution is also challenging us to think about how to properly orchestrate all aspects of our consulting capabilities together, including business experience in technology, all of which we have been carefully advancing during the last few years, both organically and through a number of targeted acquisitions. Adding this on top of our traditional strengths and our ability to build high-quality solutions, platforms and experiences with speed and scale gives EPAM the ability to extend farther across the demand landscape and allow us to serve our clients with more complex requirements in both vertical and horizontal domains. So today, we feel the time is right to position ourselves more firmly in a way that reflects the new diversity of our business. That is why in September, we launched EPAM Continuum, the integrated brand which links together our capabilities in business consulting, technology consulting, experience and innovation consulting. EPAM Continuum is part of the EPAM organization, and along with our core product engineering capabilities, brings to the market integrated senior team of practitioners that can respond to complex client needs at plays and across multiple points in our clients' organizations to help them address the challenges of adaptive enterprises dispute and agility. Similar to our emphasis on talent development and education driving higher levels of quality through our engineering excellence and evolving our marketplace and ecosystem partner models, the launch of EPAM Continuum is another example of our never-ending roadmap to change EPAM and stay relevant to our clients and the market. As I just mentioned, our transition efforts continue to be one of the sources of such change. On Tuesday, we announced the acquisition of NAYA Technologies, a data and cloud migration consultancy based in Israel and San Jose, California. This acquisition complements EPAM existing capabilities and also expands our geographic footprint into new talent market. Before I hand the call over to Jason, I would like to highlight just one of the many recognitions EPAM has received since our last earnings call. In August, EPAM was included in the list of Fortune 100 fastest-growing companies for 2019, the ranking of the world's best performers over the last 3 years in revenues, profits and stock returns. It's interesting to note also that EPAM was the only information technology services company featured on 2019 list. So to summarize, despite some of the macro level uncertainties, which have been reserved for multiple quarters, we are pleased with our third quarter results, which reflect broad-based consistent high-quality earnings that underscore our ability to execute and grow in the market that continues to demand high-end expertise and ever-changing capabilities. I will now hand the call over to Jason to give more details on our third quarter results as well as to share our Q4 and annual guidance. Jason?
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we produced strong results in both revenue and profitability, while delivering across several key operational metrics. Here are a few highlights from the quarter. Revenue came in at $588.1 million, a year-over-year growth of 25.6% on a reported basis and 27.2% growth in constant currency terms, reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of 1.6%. Revenues from acquisitions contributed approximately 1.5% to revenue growth in the quarter. Our demand patterns for this quarter were relatively consistent with those of previous quarters. We saw a strong broad-based growth across most industry verticals. Looking at Q3 revenue growth across our industry verticals, Financial Services delivered 24.4% year-over-year growth, with demand substantially driven by offerings in asset management, payment processing and insurance. Additionally, growth in the quarter was positively impacted by the timing of revenue recognition for a few financial services clients, primarily in Russia, which we previously discussed during our first quarter call. Software and Hi-Tech grew 22.9% in the quarter, driven by demand for product engineering services. Travel and Consumer grew 11.2% in the Q3, reflecting increasing demand for e-commerce, replatforming and data engineering and retail, offset by the continued ramp down of a few consumer clients. Rounding out our vertical performance, we saw very strong growth in Business Information and Media, which posted 29.3% growth in Q3, driven by demand for data and analytics services. Life Sciences and Healthcare grew 49.7%, reflecting strong growth across both industries, with demand for services in R&D IT, in addition to customer-facing solutions and applications. Emerging verticals delivered 35.1% growth, driven primarily by clients in telecommunications and energy. From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region, representing 60.9% of our Q3 revenues, grew 26.2% year-over-year or 26.5% in constant currency. Europe, representing 32.2% of our Q3 revenues, grew 24.4% year-over-year or 28.4% in constant currency. CIS, representing 4.5% of our Q3 revenues, grew 43% or 42.9% in constant currency. And finally, APAC grew 4.1% or 5.5% in constant currency, and now represents 2.4% of our revenue. Our revenue results for the quarter are underpinned by a diverse set of growth drivers across the portfolio of clients we serve. In the third quarter, growth in our top 20 clients was 17%. And our clients outside our top 20, which represent approximately 60% of revenue, grew 32% compared to the same quarter last year. Moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35.8% compared to 35.7% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 37.1% compared to 37.3% for the same quarter last year. GAAP SG&A was 20.2% of revenue compared to 19.9% in Q3 of last year. And non-GAAP SG&A came in at 18.7% of revenue compared to 18.2% in the same period last year, in line with our expectations. Our SG&A priorities remain focused on building capacity and capabilities to support our longer-term growth plans. GAAP income from operations was $80.6 million or 13.7% of revenue in the quarter compared to $64.6 million or 13.8% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $99.7 million or 17% of revenue in the quarter compared to $82.1 million or 17.5% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 16.2%, which includes a $4.2 million excess tax benefit related to stock option exercises investing of restricted stock units. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes the excess tax benefit and includes the tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments, was 21.5%. Our non-GAAP tax rate reflects a $1.2 million discrete benefit in connection with our 2018 tax return filing. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.16, which reflects the impact of foreign exchange and a lower-than-expected excess tax benefit in the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.39, an 18.8% increase over the same quarter in fiscal 2018. In Q3, there were approximately 57.8 million diluted shares outstanding. Now turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations in Q3 was $119 million compared to $102.3 million in the same quarter last year. And free cash flow was $91.8 million compared to $94.1 million in the same quarter last year. DSO was 75 days compared to 79 days at the end of Q2 and 81 days in Q3 of last year. The lower-than-average DSO this quarter was the result of our ongoing operational focus in this area. Now moving on to a few operational metrics. Our total headcount for the quarter ended at more than 35,400 employees, which includes approximately 31,400 delivery professionals, a 24.7% increase year-over-year. During the quarter, there were more than 2,000 delivery professionals who joined EPAM, primarily in our global delivery locations. Utilization was 76.1% compared to 76.4% in the same quarter last year and 78.4% in Q2. Now let's turn to our business outlook. Starting with fiscal 2019, based on continued strong demand, revenue growth will continue to be at least 23% reported and at least 24% in constant currency terms, factoring in a 1% estimated unfavorable foreign exchange impact. We expect GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%, and non-GAAP income from operations to now be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to now be approximately 15%, which includes an updated assumption for a lower level of excess tax benefit and a non-GAAP effective tax rate to now be approximately 22%. Earnings per share, we now expect GAAP-diluted EPS to be at least $4.43 for the full year, which reflects the impact of the higher GAAP effective tax rate. Non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be at least $5.35, reflecting a modest improvement in expected profitability for the full year. We continue to expect weighted average share count of 57.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For Q4 of FY '19, revenues will be at least $616 million for the fourth quarter, producing a growth rate of 22% in both reported and constant currency terms. So we anticipate there will be an insignificant foreign exchange impact. We expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, and non-GAAP effective tax rate will be approximately 23%. Earnings per share, we expect GAAP-diluted EPS will be at least $1.19 for the quarter, and non-GAAP EPS will be at least $1.43 for the quarter. And lastly, we expect a weighted average share count of 57.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our Q4 GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock compensation expense is expected to be $14.8 million. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be $2.7 million. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately $2 million loss. Tax-effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be $4.5 million. We expect excess tax benefit to be $1.8 million. And lastly, one more assumption that is not part of our GAAP to non-GAAP assumptions, we expect interest and other income to be $2.4 million in Q4. In summary, we are quite pleased with our third quarter results, which reflect continued strong demand for our services, underpinned by a diverse mix of projects and offerings across the industries we serve. With that, let's open up the call for questions.
David Straube: Before we open the call for Q&A, I do want to mention that Ark and Jason are in different locations for today's call, and we could experience a slight delay in responding to questions. With that, operator, can you please give instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Damien on for Ramsey. I wanted to ask about your revenue growth expectations here and any potential conservatism that's in your guidance? I know you have a tough comp coming up here in Q4, but I would have thought that after the acceleration this quarter that you raised full year. So maybe what's stopping you there? And how much conservatism is baked into your expectations? And then maybe as we move into 2020, is there any reason to believe that the nice growth that you've seen this year is set to decelerate, seems like all the segments are chugging along nicely, is there any reason that we cannot use this year's exit rate as sort of baseline for 2020?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So I think your points are good ones. So we continue to experience strong demand for our services, but the compare in the Q4 2018 is a challenging one. I think you'll remember that the growth in that quarter on a constant currency basis was 29% and 26.5% if you strip out the inorganic piece. So it's the highest growth rate since I've been here. We also generated 70% growth rate in the Life Science and Healthcare business and that business actually grew 26% sequentially in Q4. So that is just a -- it's a tough reference point. In addition, what we saw this year is a slightly different pattern in our CIS revenue recognition. Usually, we'd see a higher percentage of that revenue recognized in Q4. This year, we probably saw about $3 million more recognized in Q3 than we would expect based on traditional patterns. So that $3 million recognized in Q3 of 2019, I think, earlier in the year, we would have expected that would probably show up in Q4 of 2019. So again, I think that the guide from a revenue standpoint is a fair guide. And then from a growth rate standpoint, in 2020, we continue to see a strong demand for our services. The demand environment that we see is unchanged from the last conference call. And right now, we're expecting to continue to see a growth rate in excess of 20% in our fiscal 2020.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. That's great. And maybe I'll just zero-in here on my follow-up on the APAC region. It saw a slowdown there. Is there anything to do with maybe like the U.S.-China trade war or Hong Kong? Or is it just simply tougher comps? Any broad commentary on the demand environment in the Asia Pac region?
Jason Peterson: Yes. I would say that's probably specific to EPAM is that, as you would note, most of our growth has come out of Western Europe and North America. APAC, historically, we went to because our clients in North America and Europe had asked us to support their operations there. It hasn't been a huge area of focus for us because we've been driving demand and set our -- supporting demand out of our North American and European customers. And so I think, over time, it'll be an area of focus for us, and you will see greater growth. But at this point, I think what we're doing is we're prioritizing resourcing to support our large and rapidly growing customers in North America and Europe.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jason Kupferberg: I just want to start with a couple of questions on the NAYA acquisition. What kind of contribution to revenue are we thinking there for Q4 as well as 2020? And just any color on the number of employees they have? And is Israel really the main new geography they helped bring you into?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. As we mentioned, it's a data-related and migration to the cloud consultancy. It's a small company. So the contribution from all our acquisition is a little bit over 1%. So there is not much impact on numbers. But from capabilities point of view, it's a nice addition to our technology consulting group. And we do believe that it would improve our offering, mostly in U.S. and Western Europe, and also giving us kind of additional benefit to have an office in Israel and to be able to source some specific talent available there, which we all know.
Jason Peterson: So just to clarify, all acquisitions, including NAYA would make up about 1% of the growth rate in Q4 of 2019. So it's a, we think, an interesting acquisition. But again, it's more of a capability and play than it is the substantial increment in terms of revenue.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay, okay. Understood. And then can you comment on employee attrition in the quarter? I'd like to keep checking in on that just obviously given the war for digital talent. And maybe as part of that, any color you can provide just in terms of the hit rate you're seeing these days on campus offers?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So it's mostly in line with what we were sharing during the last quarter, so maybe even the last several years. So it's overstaff alignment. Our attrition rate is better than last year. So we're putting a lot of efforts to make sure that retention, working, training activities from our side and focus on education and internal learning is very high. So we put in a lot of efforts to make sure that it's not impacting our growth. But again, in general, it's always challenging, but I don't think there is any news specifically this quarter.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. If I can just sneak in one more real quick? I just like looked at the growth rate and fixed price revenue that seems to be accelerating, and I was wondering if that's reflective of a broader trend in terms of client preferences or any certain project types that you see lending themselves more to the fixed price model?
Jason Peterson: Yes, not really. So you certainly see it show up in the numbers, but let me kind of explain to you what you're seeing is, some of the acquisitions that we have do have these small sort of fixed fee arrangements that might be projects that last a couple of months. But what you're really seeing in terms of the change in that percentage of fixed fee in this quarter is we have a large customer that has been growing rapidly, that has -- our pricing arrangement with them involves sort of pricing per team. And so it's based on the component of the team, the size of the team, the skill sets of the team. And so it's very time and materials like, but because the pricing is done on a per team basis, it turns out that it was classified as a fixed fee. But again, it's traditional kind of agile kind of build new development type work. So it doesn't represent anything really different. Just the pricing is like, let's say, a vague variant on the time and materials that does show up in a fixed fee classification.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Maggie Nolan with William Blair.
Margaret Nolan: As we think about getting into more consulting-type engagements earlier in the cycle, does that change your expectation or what you're seeing in the way of larger deals?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. I think it is happening. We're not providing any specific KPIs or measurement on this, but I think it's working in line with our expectations. And that's why we also announced in EPAM Continuum brand now to make sure that we can do right go-to-market approach and explain to the client that, that's the capabilities which we now can offer and be kind of mature in the game to compete for larger deals from end to end. It is happening.
Margaret Nolan: Okay. Great. And then as you think about the company continuing to scale up, what is really the optimal structure for EPAM in terms of how that employee pyramid is balanced? How many reporting levels are necessary versus what would bloat the company and make you less agile? I'm trying to understand whether or not EPAM prefers a horizontal structure or if there is a little bit more hierarchy that needs to be introduced into the model?
Arkadiy Dobkin: We do not believe that we need more hierarchy than we have. We do believe that we probably need even less, and that's one of the key points in our efforts all the time. And at the same time, it's very dynamically changing based on the needs. So we don't know what's the optimal. We're trying to find the right configuration and kind of evolving. I think we will talk maybe a little bit more about it during our Investor Day like in a couple of weeks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.
Darrin Peller: I just want to touch first just given where we are in the year right now on what kind of conversations you're having with your clients as they start thinking about 2020 from a demand standpoint and from a specific -- more and more granularity of where they're actually looking to spend, maybe even on a vertical basis, if you can?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Listen, we understand this item to know what will be in the future. At the same time, conversation at this period of year still more focused how to finish the year, so not too much clients willing to go in conversation about next year, really. And probably very boring answer, but we don't expect any significant changes in the tone from last year's, and there is demand for people, for companies which can deliver in complexity grow. And so we do believe that the demand would be good. Anything can happen. Anything can happen as we all know from economy's standpoint. So let's wait.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So from a demand environment, we're not seeing any change from -- really any change from the last quarter. We've done an early prelim, looked at our numbers for 2020 and do believe we'll continue to grow at a rate above 20% and the only sort of callout I have just in terms of overall demand, and this is very consistent with what we said throughout this fiscal year. So this is not new commentary. But we continue to see kind of a -- some pro and some con in retail in Europe. We've got some clients who continue to make investments and continue to grow with EPAM. Other clients who are beginning to slow down their investment levels, and those clients are actually having some modest decline. And so you've got some mix in what I call kind of retail in Europe, and particularly in the U.K. And then the other area of -- and we've talked about this throughout the fiscal year is that just the European banking demand is less certain at this time. And that's unchanged from -- I think we talked about this even in Q1 of 2019.
Darrin Peller: I mean it looks like your financial segment continues to do very well, in fact, accelerate. I know some of that could have been timing. But nonetheless, I mean, with Europe being a little bit slow perhaps, I guess, it speaks to the North American financial side doing better than maybe earlier in the year. Is that fair?
Jason Peterson: Yes. In some ways, I think our portfolio might be different than many of our clients. And so we've got very strong growth in asset management, in insurance, in FinTech. There's a whole series of different -- in payment processing. And so I think there's probably less exposure to us to large banks and why you're seeing that -- the high growth as you're seeing growth in these other areas of our portfolio, and plus, as you pointed out a little bit about Russian revenue recognition, which is largely Financial Services. And that's why you're seeing the high levels of growth in our Financial Services portfolio.
Darrin Peller: That's great to hear. Just one last quick one is just on cash on hand has gone up nicely and your balance sheet looks really good. So just when we're thinking about priorities now, I mean, you've done a number of smaller tuck-ins. Just anything in the -- in larger size that's in your pipeline or discussions right now from -- I assume it's all going to be used either for just keeping cash on hand or M&A rather than...
Jason Peterson: Yes. So I think you've seen us do more acquisitions this year. As you point out, they've been small sort of tuck-in acquisitions. I think you'll continue to see us do a fair number of acquisitions in the coming year. And I think it's likely that the acquisitions are at least one or more of them could be larger, and that would be somewhat consumptive of cash. And then the other place where we're using cash is to continue to build out our physical infrastructure and our delivery centers. And so those are probably the two places where you'll see cash used in the coming year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company.
Kyle Peterson: This is actually Kyle Peterson on for Mayank. Just want to start on margins, the profitability has obviously looked very good the last several quarters kind of towards the top end of that kind of 16% to 17% range, and the 4Q guide implies that to continue. So how should we think about margins moving forward? Is 16% to 17% still the right band to look at? Or should they be more kind of on the upper end of that? I just want to see your thoughts on the profitability outlook.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So as you pointed out, we run on the top half of the range in all quarters in 2019. And at the same time, though, we continue to believe that operating in the 16% to 17% range is appropriate for the business. So I probably wouldn't have a different guide than what we've talked about throughout this fiscal year.
Kyle Peterson: Great. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on the Software and Hi-Tech vertical, at least on a sequential basis, seemed to be a little softer relative to all the other verticals, which were quite strong. Is there any seasonality there that we should pay attention to? Or anything particular kind of happening under the hood? Just want to get a little more color on that.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don't think we have any specific comment on this. It's -- some quarters, you're getting a number of new accounts, and it's getting a little bit flatter than the last spike. So I don't think you will find any specific trends if you start to analyze backward. But there is nothing to highlight there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Joseph Foresi: My first question is just around the governors to growth. As you look at the business model today, obviously, there's pockets of weakness. But is -- how is the human capital element potentially a governor to growth? And how could it impact margins? There's a couple of different players in the space in other public company that's obviously focused on the Ukraine. Is really the human resources the one governor to growth that you worry about the most? And how does that shake out today versus 2, 3 years ago?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It is definitely one of the major components of the growth, not just clearly number of people, but the quality of this effort. And that's a topic which we kind of touch in practically each quarter, and we -- specifically we're talking about our investments in training, education, selection, retention. So it's a very big topic, which is almost impossible to address here. If you're asking compare it to last couple of years, I think it was pretty tough 3, 4 years ago. And we advanced in our infrastructure or kind of ecosystem, internal ecosystem, how to deal with this. And that's why I don't think it's still much different than a couple of years ago, but it's still pretty tough. And again, I think, also it would be one of the more advanced topics, which we are going to cover during the Investor Day.
Joseph Foresi: Got it. Okay. Then just my last kind of 2-part question. Can you just give us an update on attrition rates and wage inflation in perhaps your more dominant regions? And then margins seem to want to continue to move upwards. I know I've asked a couple of times on the call about the kind of upward push on the margins. Maybe you could give us sort of your long-term view on where you think margins can go? And what the puts and takes are there?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So from an attrition standpoint, the attrition is lower in Q3 of '19 than it was in Q3 of '18. Attrition continues to run in the low teens for us. So again, we've focused a lot of energy on that and making certain that we're providing an appropriate sort of career experience for our delivery personnel so that they really do feel that they've got a career in a long-term home at EPAM. From a wage inflation standpoint, the wage inflation really hasn't changed throughout the year. So really no change there versus what I've talked about in the past. And then from a margin standpoint, I think we're going to continue to focus on running, let's say, the gross margin at about the level that we've been running it at. And so -- and then from an SG&A standpoint, I think we've talked about this sort of 18% to 19% range. And so yes, I don't see a -- I wouldn't be talking about a different range for 2020. Certainly, you can see that we've been able to run at the top end of the range in 2019, but I think what we still talk about is the 16% to 17% adjusted IFO target range as we enter the 2020 fiscal year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Good quarter. So I guess my question is, last time, we spoke in September, you guys said the demand exceeds supply, which for -- generally has been true for some time. But the question that I have is, if that continues, does it make sense at any point for you guys to make sort of a scale-based acquisition as opposed to what you've generally been doing is capability-based acquisitions, just to kind of tap into more of the demand spectrum?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It might make sense if it would allow us to -- after this, to expand organically more as well, and the quality of this acquisition would be in line with our expectation, which is very kind of a long shot. So -- but we're looking for this, and if this opportunity will come, definitely, we'll be considering. But again, sizable acquisition with high-quality resources and ability to grow at least 20% after this. So these type of companies probably cost a lot and have their own strategy.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Understood. No, that makes sense. The other thing was just really a clarification with regards to the stock-based compensation and accruals, the impact of all of that. I'm thinking that's already in the number for 4Q margins already, right?
Jason Peterson: Yes. Correct. So with the level of variable compensation, certainly the accrual is in for that based on our expectations for the performance in the fiscal year. And then the stock-based comp, yes, we would be recognizing expense associated with that throughout the year.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: As a percent of revenue, would you expect that to start to be trending upward as we look in the future?
Jason Peterson: I haven't thought about what that specific element would be. And so let me think about that, and we can talk about that later. Yes, and I guess, maybe I'll just leave it at that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vladimir Bespalov with VTB Capital.
Vladimir Bespalov: Congratulations on the number. My first question is like kind of broad one. Maybe you could talk a little bit about your conversation with clients? For example, if the clients need to cut spending because of the macro uncertainties and things like this, where would IT spending stand in this -- in their priorities right now, whether this is the last kind of expense item that they're going cut or you see risks on this side? And probably a couple of technical questions on the numbers. First, I see some acceleration in hiring. So maybe you could provide some color on this acceleration in the last reported quarter. And also, there is a change in the trend of your client concentration, the top 5 clients started to increase, and this is the first time for the past several quarters. So is this a kind of quarterly volatility or maybe you see some changes on this side as well?
Jason Peterson: Ark, do you want to talk about the demand?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. Can you repeat the first question about demand? You said if we feel that there is some softness on some clients, and then I didn't understand exactly what was the question, then would -- our reaction should be one-on-one. Can you clarify a little bit?
Vladimir Bespalov: Yes, yes. Sorry, if it was not very clear. So my question was basically, if we see some macro uncertainties due to some recession in the global economy and things like this, and companies, your clients in particular, will have to cut spending. So in terms of cutting spending, where IT spending stands for your clients? Whether it's going to be the #1 item which they are going to cut? Or since this is so important for sustainability of their business, this will be probably the last one? How, in general, you feel that your clients think about this?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Sure. So it's a very tough question taking into account how many clients and how many different situations could be there. So -- and also taking into account how to predict the level of impact or what -- how big recession or how big like economic downturn could be. There is different package of clients. For some of them, it might be critical. For a lot of clients, it would be probably opportunity to invest continuously in digital part of the business. So I can give you from our experience like 10 years ago when pretty tough one happened. We had a couple of clients who stopped completely, and we had a bunch of clients who actually continued to grow since then. Some jumped to opportunity for utilizing the good capability in engineering count. But at this time, for example, EPAM was flat for a year, and then started to grow 50%, okay? So maybe not what expected, but I don't think there is really a clear answer to this.
Jason Peterson: And just on the headcount. So the headcount additions in Q3 just are suggestive of what we're seeing from a demand environment. We continue to see a strong demand environment. We grew headcount rapidly in places like India and Mexico in addition to rapid growth rates in our traditional geographies like Ukraine and Belarus. We're also beginning to stand up a few additional sort of smaller centers, and so you'd see some growth there. And then the Competentum acquisition came with over 200 headcount, primarily in Russia. And so for the most part, the headcount growth is really being driven substantially by what we're seeing from a demand standpoint.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities.
Moshe Katri: A couple of things here. It seems that there is a difference in dynamics looking at the growth rates between the top 20 and the rest of the business in terms of client base. So should we assume that there are a number of large top 5 or top 10 clients that are kind of dragging growth much lower unproportionately? Maybe you can give us some color on that. And then maybe some color also on what are we seeing on pricing? I think, historically, we've seen some pricing uptick of -- in terms of a couple of hundred basis points, is that still the case? And then any change in the dynamics looking at wage inflation, specifically in some of the geographies in Eastern Europe? That will be helpful.
Jason Peterson: So from a -- I guess, a concentration, and I think there also was a question I was asked about from the -- by the prior caller, is that the -- I would say that the little bit of an uptick that you've seen between Q2 and Q3 in terms of concentration is not something that we expect over a longer period of time. I think it's just a bit of a subtle kind of uptick. And we have seen some good growth in some of our larger customers. But at the same time, we're seeing extremely high growth rates in customers outside our top 20 as well. So I think it's a fairly typical -- and again, I think it speaks to the diversification of the business that we've got rapid growth in our large customers. And we also have growth and even greater growth in our customers outside the top 20. From a wage inflation standpoint, at least at this time, it's pretty similar to what we've seen in past years. Hard to predict what it could look like in the future. But at this point in time, it's been very consistent. And from a pricing environment standpoint, also quite similar. So we continue to get rate increases across a subset of our large long-standing customers. And then with newer engagements, those generally have somewhat stronger pricing just based on the overall kind of demand for resourcing in a market that is resource constrained.
Moshe Katri: And just if I can just sneak in one last one. Looking at -- obviously, you gave us some color on Q4. Is there anything that we should kind of keep in mind in terms of how the Q1 will start in terms of budgets and funding for projects and seasonality? Is there anything unusual looking into Q1 at this point?
Jason Peterson: Yes. We've done a prelim look for the full fiscal year. And again, it's very preliminary. And it does, again, speak to a growth rate in excess of 20% in the coming year. It's hard for me to provide color on Q1 at this time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen & Company.
Bryan Bergin: I wanted to ask on the sales force. Can you provide an update on the sales strategy as you look to 2020? Any color around more proactive development of a larger direct sales team? And if so, any particular service lines or areas of focus?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I don't think we have big changes like with the exception like we're talking about more consultative approach. And consulting approach is definitely part of our go-to-market and business development strategy, out of which clients with smarter ways of recognizing the opportunities and challenges they have and what are the solutions. But in general, the market which we operate is pretty interesting. From growth point of view, I don't think we're opening kind of new lines of businesses or new sectors to go after. And today, we already -- we're growing our headcount in direct sales over the last couple of years. So I think we're, in general, in good place here.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. Does the build-out or broadening of that consulting pressures, does that do anything from a profitability profile? Or is it consistent with where you are in the company average?
Arkadiy Dobkin: We will see what will be happening in that as probably everybody remember was our answer for some time because it's about growth, it's not about profitability for us to support the growth we have right now and to be more impactful on client results, but we bring in some additional people. Profitability here probably depends on the cost of the resources and wages for consultants are also high. So I think it was balanced. So it's -- revenue growth going forward is the main goal here.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So significantly larger engagements, which we hope will also have higher value. And then, again, it's blended as part of an overall kind of delivery organization, kind of a consulting combined with the delivery. And so don't expect a material impact in profitability, at least in the near-term or the coming year.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. That makes sense. And Jason, just to follow up on the delivery regions. You mentioned some smaller centers you're setting up. Are those in new regions for EPAM?
Jason Peterson: Yes. They're in somewhat newish regions for us, kind of, let's say, tangential to some of the places that we've done business over the years.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna.
James Friedman: It's Jamie. I'll just ask two upfront. Jason, with regard to the -- I hate to start here, but with regard to the tax rate, that was a little confusing because you had a divergence between your non-GAAP tax commentary and your tax commentary. So I just want to make sure I heard that right. So that's for Jason. And then, Ark, I don't know if you aren't aware of it, there is a fair amount of controversy about the outsourcing trends, product development trends in the Software and Hi-Tech vertical. One of your competitors has called out some challenges, they're exiting some verticals, they're exiting some customers where you guys actually are present. So I heard your answer to the previous one, there's a little deceleration, nothing to call out, but we're just trying to get a sense from our seat, is there something more profound going on here? Or do you feel like you're still adding the value and your roadmap looks positive? So the first on tax and the second on Software and Hi-Tech.
Jason Peterson: And so I guess, I'll talk first about the tax rate. And so I think one of the statements that I made was that the excess tax benefit was somewhat less than we had expected inside the quarter. And so that would have impacted the GAAP tax rate. And then just the other statement we made is that we had a discrete benefit associated with our 2018 return, and that discrete benefit would have impacted both the GAAP and the non-GAAP rate. But what I was trying to clarify is that's why the GAAP tax rate was quite a bit lower than the approaching 23% that we've sort of talked about as our expected non-GAAP tax rate.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. And second question -- your question is like, if we feel that there is something special happening in Hi-Tech and software sector from kind of product engineering services point of view?
James Friedman: Yes, yes, that's what I was trying to ask.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I don't know what -- to whom you refer that there are some specific problems or whatever. We actually do believe that it's a strong component for us, and it's a strategic component for us. We would like to stay there. And we do think that we bring a lot of value to some small software companies and perhaps kind of mature software houses. And what we said is the Hi-Tech which is all digital platform borne companies. And I think it's -- we expanded pretty well there. So -- and it's definitely not any specific in this quarter.
James Friedman: Got it. I mean the numbers were good. It's just that I was trying to get some context about the overall demand trajectory. I appreciate the color.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Dobkin for any final comments.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you. Thank you, everybody, for your time this morning. I would like also to thank all our employees and their dedication to provide services and to help us to grow. And management team and myself looking forward to Investor Day on November 21 in Boston. So always, please contact David if you have any questions. And hopefully, see you face-to-face pretty soon. Thanks. Bye.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-09 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to EPAM Systems' Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this conference is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the conference over to David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.
David Straube: Thank you, Operator. And good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's second quarter 2019 results. If you have not, a copy is available at epam.com, in the investors section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the investors section of our website. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I would like to start with a few financial highlights from our second quarter. We delivered revenues of $552 million, reflecting an approximate 24% year-over-year growth or 25% in constant currency terms. Additionally, we delivered strong non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.28, which represents approximately 27% growth from Q2 of 2018. Our growth during the first half 2019 reflects our position in the markets we serve, which continue to transform at extremely fast pace. Disruption is occurring across every industry, driven by the impacts of new technologies from one side; and very dynamic changes in the competitive landscape, led by digitally native companies separating at different speed levels from another. We do believe that these trends have and will continue to create opportunities for EPAM. And we feel we are well positioned to continue to serve our clients and offer solutions to solve their increasingly complex business challenges, all that as long as we are able to challenge ourselves to adapt our offerings and our own organization to new market needs. So our journey to drive our own relevancy in the market is nonstop as we push across EPAM to challenge and change the ways in which we operate and serve clients. That involves all aspects of our operations, including our talent acquisition strategy, expansions in new geographies and additions to our offerings and capabilities. Everything is done to increase value by bringing our core product, engineering, digital engagement and consulting services to the next level. Our recent acquisition of Competentum, which we announced in July, is a good illustration of our direction. While it is a small company in terms of revenue and employee base, Competentum allows the extend EPAM education and learning capabilities as part of our digital proposition across both our clients' portfolios and our internal needs. We believe professional development in the digital transformation space is becoming just as important as the strategy reach guides. As the platforms that powers the enterprise, new organizations should become highly adaptive in nature and will require cross-functional teams who master each step of the digital product life cycle to have an enterprise-wide digital-first mindset and a real hunger for constant skills and capabilities upgrades. This approach is critical for successful transformative efforts and another example of how EPAM continues to evolve itself while help our clients across different parts of their organization to evolve too. Before I hand the call over to Jason, I would like to highlight a few recognitions EPAM has received in the first half of 2019, which are good illustrations of what types of changes are happening to us. As we've shared many times in the past, EPAM historically has differentiated itself by strong engineering practices. We do believe it's still a critical area of focus for us, to be able to keep it this way, while still growing into other high-volume directions. In FH 2019 annual agency report, EPAM was recognized among the top 50 largest agencies in the United States, up from our position of 130th just several years ago. In the U.K. we are already among the top 10 for sometime. Plus, Forrester placed EPAM among the top largest digital experience agencies based on our demonstrated market presence and capabilities across customer market in commerce and product/service portionings. Agencies also have a different definition in that context. [indiscernible], to reference Forrester, should have over 10,000 relevantly skilled employees and be able to demonstrate the delivery of experience architectures that combine breaking software and custom port, truckloads of data and content, hooks to callers and transactional systems and insight and all there is; and to integrate all these parts and infuse them with creative thought and execution to expose, differentiate and elevate brand wellness. Or in short, to analyze, create, design, build and manage your digital customer experience in the context of their digital business transformation. And on another side of the spectrum, EPAM was recognized by Forrester as one of the most significant application modernization and migration service providers capable of addressing the diverse set of needs in both legacy and cloud-native architectures. We think it's important to point out that, of all those large companies listed, we are usually the smallest and also the fastest-growing player because of our much higher proportion of those in-demand services offerings. I also would like to remind everyone about 2 key points we talked about during previous calls which remain very important for us to support our growth story. We continue to build our consulting offering to blend together industry experience and technology capabilities and to enable our global engineering services to deliver smarter and in turn to bring real value to our clients. And we continue investing in our internal digital platforms to make our operations not only agile but also truly adaptive, allowing us to better apply the talents we have, as well to attract new talent and to grow and retain it smartly. And that is also a continuous effort. So to summarize. Despite some of the macro-level uncertainties, which we talked about it before and seems like they are here to stay with us for an undefined time, we delivered another quarter of consistent, high-quality results, which underscores our ability to execute and grow in the market that continues to demand high-end expertise and ever-changing capabilities. With that said, I will now hand the call over to Jason to give more details on our second quarter results. Jason?
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark. And good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we produced strong results in both revenues and profitability while delivering across several key operational metrics. Here are a few highlights from the quarter. Revenue came at -- came in at $551.6 million, a year-over-year growth of 23.8% on a reported basis and 25.1% growth in constant currency, reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of 1.3%. Our demand patterns this quarter were relatively consistent with those of previous quarters. We saw strong, broad-based growth across most industry verticals, balanced by slower growth in a few specific industries. Looking at Q2 revenue across our industry verticals: Financial services, our largest vertical, delivered 16.9% year-over-year growth. We continue to see increasing demand for offerings in asset management and payment processing. In addition, insurance, which currently accounts for a modest share of revenues, represents a rapidly growing part of our financial services portfolio. [Technical Difficulty] consumer grew 6% reported and 8.2% in constant currency terms. Growth in Q2 reflected the continued ramp-down of projects at a few consumer clients in Europe, along with lower growth in North America. Software and high tech grew 24.1% in the quarter, and business information and media posted 26.4% growth in Q2. Rounding out our vertical performance, we saw very strong growth in both life sciences and health care, which grew 53.7%, reflecting broad-based growth across both industries and in existing and new client programs; as well as emerging verticals, which delivered 51.3% growth driven primarily by clients in telecommunications and energy. From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region representing 60.7% of our Q2 revenues, grew 26.6% year-over-year, or 26.9% in constant currency. Europe, representing 32.2% of our Q2 revenues, grew 18.4% year-over-year, or 21.1% in constant currency. CIS, representing 4.5% of our Q2 revenues, grew 29.3%, or 32.4% in constant currency. And finally, APAC grew 19.9% or, 23.3% in constant currency; and now represents 2.6% of our revenues. In the second quarter, growth in our top 20 clients was 14.8%, and growth outside our top 20 clients was approximately 31% compared to the same quarter last year. Our revenue results from the quarter are underpinned by a diverse set of growth drivers across the portfolio of clients we serve. Moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35.5% compared to 35.1% in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 36.8% compared to 36.7% for the same quarter last year. GAAP SG&A was 20.3% of revenue compared to 20.9% in Q2 of last year, and non-GAAP SG&A came in at 18.5% of revenue compared to 18.9% in the same period last year. Our SG&A spend in Q2 was focused primarily on investments in facilities and our employees and is intended to support our longer-term growth. GAAP income from operations was $72.9 million or 13.2% of revenue in the quarter compared to $54.2 million or 12.2% of revenue in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $92.6 million or 16.8% of revenue in the quarter compared to $72.3 million or 16.2% of revenue in Q2 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 16.6%, which includes a $4.7 million excess tax benefit related to stock option exercises investing in restricted stock units. The actual benefit was lower than the $10 million forecasted at the beginning of the quarter, which was the result of a substantially lower number of stock options exercised in the quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes the excess tax benefit and includes the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments, was 22.5%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.02, which reflects the lower-than-expected tax benefit in the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.28, reflecting a 26.7% increase over the same quarter in fiscal 2018. In Q2, there were approximately 57.6 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations in Q2 was $44 million compared to $59.5 million in the same quarter last year. And free cash flow was $32.4 million compared to $50.9 million in the same quarter last year. Reflected in our cash flow this quarter were payments related to our annual variable compensation program and the ongoing support of our inorganic growth strategy. DSO was 79 days compared to 78 days at the end of Q1 fiscal 2019 and 83 days in Q2 of last year. We remain focused on managing our DSO at these levels. Moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended the quarter with over 29,400 delivery professionals, a 21% increase year-over-year and a net addition of more than 1,500 production professionals driven primarily by new hires in our global delivery locations and low attrition in the quarter. Our total head count ended at more than 33,100 employees. Utilization was 78.4% compared to 78% in the same quarter last year and 79.9% in Q1.  Now let's turn to our business outlook. Starting with fiscal 2019. Based on continued strong demand, revenue growth will now be at least 23% reported and at least 24% in constant currency terms, factoring in a 1% estimated unfavorable foreign exchange impact. We expect GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to now be approximately 14%, which includes an updated assumption for a lower level of excess tax benefit. And our non-GAAP effective tax rate will continue to be approximately 23%. For earnings per share, we now expect GAAP diluted EPS to be at least $4.43 for the full year, which reflects the impact with the higher GAAP effective tax rate. Non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be at least $5.25, reflecting a modest improvement in expected profitability for the full year. We now expect weighted average share count of 57.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For Q3 FY '19. Revenues will be at least $579 million for the third quarter, producing a growth rate of at least 23% reported and at least 24% in constant currency terms, factoring in a 1% estimated unfavorable foreign exchange impact. We expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 15%, and non-GAAP effective tax rate will be approximately 23%. Earnings per share. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $1.14 for the quarter, and non-GAAP EPS will be at least $1.32 for the quarter. And lastly, we expect a weighted average share count of 57.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock compensation expense is expected to be approximately $16.2 million in Q3 and $15.5 million in Q4. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $2.8 million for each of the remaining quarters. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $2 million loss for the second half, with a $1 million loss in each of the remaining quarters. The tax-effective non-GAAP adjustment is expected to be around $4.5 million in Q3 and approximately $4.4 million in Q4. We expect excess tax benefit to be around $6 million in Q3 and $4 million in Q4. And lastly, one more assumption that is not part of our GAAP to non-GAAP assumptions: We expect interest and other income to be $2.6 million for each of the remaining quarters. In summary. We are pleased with our second quarter results, which reflect continued strong demand for our services, underpinned by a diverse mix of projects and offerings across the industries we serve. Our first half for 2019 positions EPAM well for continued success in the second half of the fiscal year. With that, let's open the call up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Maggie Nolan from William Blair.
Margaret Nolan: I wanted to talk about the digital transformation scope that you touched on, Arkadiy. How much of the employee base do you feel like is adequately trained in those types of digital transformation skills? And then can you talk about how you're defining that internally, what scopes are truly considered digital? Or maybe asking in a different way, what's more in focus now than would have perhaps been roughly 3 or so years ago?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Maggie, yes, it is actually very difficult questions because, you know this, we're not sharing or reporting what is our digital here versus not digital because it's a very difficult classification. And I can refer back to Forrester profile, which is saying, okay, we increase in category where we have more than 10,000 employees versus -- even if it's just 10,000, it's already at least 30% of our people versus some other companies on the list which are probably much less. But we think that majority of our work actually in this category because our core or our legacy in product -- software product engineering, which is most of the what I am reading from other classifications attributes this type of services to digital as well. Inside of EPAM, we're definitely focusing on engagement platform and analytics platform as very core digital, but modernization, for example, or a lot of other activities like RPA which is like sometimes could be put in different categories, could be considered as [indiscernible]. Again, in short, I will say that we consider it as digital as majority of what we do today. And similar on training. So majority of our people train on this, and it was another key point for what we were sharing. We're very keen on education. And we're building pretty strong educational service not only focused internally but also helping our clients to go through the same world of transformation. And as I said, it might be a little bit fuzzy answer, but it is a difficult question.
Margaret Nolan: Okay. And then you've talked about kind of the efforts to continue to drive relevancy in the market. And you've been a little bit more acquisitive in the last 2 years, so do we start thinking about a more consistent acquisition engine going forward? And then does the current M&A funnel support that? And then also Jason, just what was the organic growth in the quarter and now the expected organic contribution for the full year with the recent acquisition that you did?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think, from consistency point, the only consistency is that we're constantly looking for the right fit and to looking how to improve our capabilities. There is no any kind of plans to do 2 acquisitions per quarter or 4 acquisitions like -- per quarter next year. That's not part of what -- how we're thinking about it, but we're constantly looking for opportunities. In terms of the how it's impacting our growth, I think it's very minimal because we are looking for small, competency-led companies, not kind of roll-up approach, which not excluding that we might hit some big ones as well in the future, but so far that was the focus here. Jason can comment on the numbers.
Jason Peterson: Yes. No, Ark is absolutely correct. So when we guided at the beginning of the year, we had included an assumption that we'd get up to or approximately 1% of revenue from inorganic contribution. That has not changed at all. These are relatively modest-sized acquisitions. However, just to answer the question on Q2: So the reported growth rate was 23.8%. If you adjust for foreign exchange, we had about a 1.3% impact, so the constant currency growth rate will be 25.1%. And the inorganic contribution was actually just below 1% for the quarter. So from a constant currency organic growth rate, we would be at 24.2% for Q2 of 2019.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Very good quarter here. Congratulations...
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: The question I have is you spent obviously a lot of time and effort and investments here in creating a much better-diversified business than it used to be across many verticals. As we go past that phase and it becomes more about continuing to just scale what you have built, should we expect some operating leverage to creep into the financial model in the next year or 2?
Jason Peterson: Yes, so we -- here's how I would think about the business. And I think I'll talk more about what's happening this year. And then maybe we'll have some maybe vague discussion around next year. We're very focused on continuing to make investments that allow us to grow the business in excess of 20% annually. And so what we've been looking at is a range of 16% to 17%. We think we're clearly going to operate very firmly in that range. And I think, if you've looked at your model, it'd probably show that we're going to operate in the upper half of that range in 2019. And we're going to continue to focus on the 16% to 17%. What you will see in the second half is we're going to continue to make investments, some of the investments that Ark talked about in learning platforms and professional development. And so again I think you probably should continue to think about the business more in the 16% to 17% range.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Understood. And then the travel vertical. Can you remind us when the wind-down of the European clients end? And another sort of numbers question unrelated is can you remind us if 3Q and 4Q have any ups and downs as it relates to billing days.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So I didn't hear the first part of the question.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: The first part of the question was with regards the travel vertical. You're phasing the wind-down of some European clients. Can you remind when that ends?
Jason Peterson: Yes, I'm not sure that I understand the wind-down. I know that we've seen some degree of, let's say, softness with our -- with a European sort of consumer and yes. So I don't know if it's specific wind-down as much as it's kind of a mixed performance where we've got some growing accounts. And we've got some accounts that are either sort of flat to declining. And that's producing a lower than -- a lower growth rate that you've seen in that area in the past, but I think what you see is that in any given quarter we were able to drive the high levels of growth because of the diversified sort of demand portfolio. From a Q3/Q4, it's a little bit complicated, but I'm sure you follow this, which is that we have more generally billed days in Q3. But we also have more holidays and a bit more of summer vacation, if you will. And so generally what you see is maybe a little bit of improvement in gross margin in that time period. And then Q4 is usually a strong quarter for us, but we've been operating at a quite high level of profitability here in the first half, so I don't expect a big uptick in gross margin or profitability in the second half. What I do -- what you would normally see, though, is some positives in the gross margin because of the additional billed days in Q3.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So basically, Ashwin, in short, all this volatility more in line with usual volatility for us for different verticals in the past. And yes, there are some softness and specifically on U.K. retailers, but again even that we can attribute to more regular starts and starts expression.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay. The regular ups and downs. Okay. Got it, understood.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.
Jason Kupferberg: I actually just wanted to follow up on Ashwin's question just to clarify on travel and consumer. Are you expecting any re-acceleration in the second half? I mean I think your comps get easier, but obviously there's maybe some lingering macro headwinds, so I just wanted to make sure we've got the right framework for how to think about the second half there. Do we move up from the 8% constant currency there, or should we assume kind of stabilization? And then maybe just while you're on the topic of verticals: Any incremental commentary on financial services? Had a nice rebound and re-acceleration in the quarter. Is that sustainable in the back half?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So I think I'd kind of echo what Ark said in the last comment. It's that the business has got a -- it's broadly diversified both in terms of industry verticals; and in terms of customers, both new and longer-term EPAM customers. And so in any given quarter, you're going to see one vertical might drive more the growth than another. A couple years ago, we were talking about single-digit growth in health care and life sciences, and here in this year you've been over 50% from a growth rate standpoint. Last quarter, as you point out, financial services was single digit, and in this quarter, we're back firmly in a high-teens growth rate. And so we continue to see strong demand overall. If I were to talk about travel and consumer, yes, I think potentially the demand could increase a little bit in the second half, but we've -- again I think we are seeing a little bit of mixed result in that portfolio. From a financial services standpoint, we're seeing very strong growth in cards and payment processing, in asset management. And insurance is still small for us, but it's growing quite rapidly. And so I'm hopeful around financial services. And overall I -- we feel good about the demand in the market.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. How does the composition of your top 10 client list look today versus, say, 12 to 18 months ago? And would you expect material changes in that list, let's say, over the next 12 to 18 months as some newer clients continue to scale their work with EPAM? Because obviously the growth in the non-top 20 continues to be very strong.
Jason Peterson: We've seen a little bit of movement here and maybe the last couple of quarters as companies maybe slightly changed position. One thing that's noteworthy, and I think I talked about this in the last call, is 1 of our top 5 customers split into 2 customers. And so what used to be 10 customers in our top 10 is really effectively 9. And so that probably changes a little bit some of those comparisons as you look at our concentration over time, but again I would say a little bit of movement but reasonably consistent.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen.
Bryan Bergin: I wanted to ask on the acquisition of Competentum; and talking what this does for you internally, as far as the strategy goes. And is there a function of any internal savings or benefits worth quantifying? And then just more broadly, how should we think about software and platforms as an offering? Is it -- does it signal a move toward more of that as we go forward?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, any educational capabilities are making some impact internally as well, but we investing in this area constantly. So we don't think it would be any specific SG&A savings. And especially the company is pretty, pretty, pretty small. So it's aiding some capabilities, which we would be -- would have to build ourself, but again it's pretty small. So from generally software platforms, we'd -- more considering them as the accelerators because in our business we do believe in the differentiation coming from right integration, customer extension and buildup. So it we're not really considering that it will be very strong separate line of business with license revenue or subscription revenue. We have this today and it's pretty small. And we do think that it will be a very modest percentage of our work, but at the same time, it's giving us a good jump start in many large implementations. And that's a goal: how to build the right portfolio of accelerators to start faster but then, because of technology changing, how to upgrade these accelerators very fast as well instead of being stuck with some more standard software which would become legacy very, very quickly.
Bryan Bergin: Okay, that's helpful. And then I wanted to ask on health care. The vertical is obviously very strong. Can you comment on the mix of the work that is in that vertical currently? And then are -- you believe you're taking share in that market?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we're planning this for some time. Initially it was mostly around R&D life science. Now I think we expanded to commercial life science component. And we expanded to health care, insurance component as well. So basically, if 4, 5 years ago it was practically one kind of concentration point for growth, right now it's at least 3.
Jason Peterson: Yes. And we're also seeing more consulting business in the health care space as well.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And I think there is good complementing between them because R&D becoming so integral part of general commercial life science. And also there are a lot of overlap with health care providers from both side from payers and providers, where it's all becoming much more realtime and understanding of bioinformatics and specific data sets. So it's very important. So I think it's healthy enough to grow.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Joseph Foresi: Your growth seems to be fairly well balanced. And I think historically within IT services -- I mean well balanced across all your verticals. I think, historically, in IT services that's fairly rare. So my first question is, can you just describe for us the strategy in some of your newer verticals and maybe why you think your acceleration in those verticals has been above what we've seen sort of historically in other areas and from other companies?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it's -- that goes to our history as well, and we repeated this many times. So we started as a product engineering extension to our clients. Like a lot of top technology companies, we help clients initially, and 10 years ago, it was a major source of our revenue. And through this, we also were -- we started to understand the industries, but specifically from what people would call today digital transformation point of view, companies were adopting new software platforms and they need to be extended very quickly and with a good quality. And we're building on the skills. And when we come into new verticals today, we're clearly beginning to understand then how to build right products. But we also during the last 6, 7 years, and that's what we've pointed out today, built pretty strong digital strategy, consultative components; and integrating this very closely with our engineering services kind of to -- not just to advise but to deliver on our advice well, with -- again with the ability to put it in production with right scalability and performance components. And I think this engineering heritage, which we're now blending with a consultative approach, probably is helping us to be a little bit more consistent than someone else.
Joseph Foresi: Got it. Okay. And then just as a follow-up. On the margin outlook, obviously you gave guidance for this year, but maybe you can talk about your thoughts about margins over the long term and some of the levers that you have in place that could drive them up or down. How should we be thinking about any margin opportunity over the long run?
Jason Peterson: I think we're -- we've proven that we can run, I would say, kind of anywhere in that 16% to 17% range. So I think, a couple years ago, we were sort of closer to the bottom end of that range. And here you see us in these quarters running near the top or sometimes just over that range. I think that's probably to think about us able to comfortably sort of run in the 16% to 17% range. And it will be volatility by quarter based in part on utilization and billed dates and some of that, but I think probably just to continue to think of us as a 16% to 17% adjusted income from operations is the -- is really what we're looking to drive and in part because we are going to continue making the investments that Arkadiy has been talking about to continue to drive the greater than 20% annual revenue growth.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Andrew Bauch with Wolfe Research.
Andrew Bauch: Just wanted to touch on the segments once again. Europe showed some pretty solid growth in the quarter despite you guys calling out in the past some uncertainty in clients around Brexit and such, so maybe you guys could just give an update on what you're seeing in the market there and your expectations for the rest of the year.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think the -- and this is probably very much in line with what we shared before, that there is some certain level of volatility across different verticals and even geographies here as well because we're working also with global accounts. And sometimes, these global accounts are growing faster in one region versus in other region, so it's really extremely difficult for us to predict volatility in specific segment, while -- in general, like we give in the guidance like on the total numbers. So [indiscernible] getting better than last quarter. We clearly -- but it's still very unclear what will be in Q4, for example, in the results of Brexit, which nobody knows what, how companies will react. What we're more comfortable to share and how we're thinking about is that here we have some softness in some subset of our markets. There is enough demand for the type of services which we provide that we will be able to balance and deliver for the kind of aggregated numbers.
Andrew Bauch: Got it. And then I guess, for my follow-up, digging into the gross margin numbers. And they seem to be pretty consistent here. And you guys have called out before the strategy to implement more nearshoring capabilities, which from our perspective could eventually weigh on margin, but maybe you guys could just update us on your strategy towards nearshoring and how you kind of expect that to weigh on the gross margin side.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So the strategy is still there. We're going to improve our -- when you say nearshoring, you mean...
Andrew Bauch: In the north -- maybe like a North America more in-market...
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. So okay. Because nearshoring is a little bit -- yes. If we're talking in-market presence, then we definitely will expand there because -- with the complexity of the services which we delivering. And we need like more local presence from expertise and dynamics of engagements point of view and consultancy point of view. So we will be increasing this. So how it's going to impact gross margin, again it's we need like to wait and see exactly because there are different series here. But yes, it might be profitability in general low in the markets. At the same time, we think that we would be able to improve, increase the total value. And to the clients, we will be able to balance this as well. And we do believe that we would be able to do it...
Jason Peterson: And we're -- certainly we're very focused on margin at the account level and sort of maintaining profitability in the gross margin area. And so as we've talked about in the past, that we clearly are focused on pricing and sort of maintaining or improving account profitability given the opportunity.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush.
Moshe Katri: Good quarter. Two follow-up questions, and I guess they're all kind of related also to margin trends. Maybe we can talk a bit about wage inflation trends and the various regions that you're focusing on in Eastern Europe. Anything out of the ordinary there that we should kind of focus on? And then maybe talk in general about pricing trends for some of the new deals that are coming onboard.
Jason Peterson: Yes. From a head count growth standpoint, we've seen growth, obviously, in our traditional regions. We've also seen further growth in our India operations. From a wage inflation standpoint, I would say that it's little changed from the past. Actually we've seen a decline in utilization -- in attrition year-over-year. So we feel quite good about that. I don't know, Ark. Do you want to talk about new deals and pricing or...
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it's -- again it's -- Moshe, it's very much in line with what we were seeing before. I don't think I can call anything that's something very new or extraordinary happening. So at our level, at our size of the company and our subset of the market which we're focusing, I think it's still pretty consistent, okay? And the last one [indiscernible] again. We can repeat all these scary stories about Brexit and all of this. And yes, it's making some softness here and there, but as I mentioned before, we do believe that we would be able to mitigate it through refocusing our focus across different geos and segments.
Moshe Katri: Okay. Great. And just a follow-up. Some of the -- looking at some of the legacy vendors that made some strategic moves to get into the space. And Ark, is there anything different competitively? Or is it still kind of a handful of companies that are able to do this kind of work and that obviously gives you guys a pretty big competitive advantage?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Well, in general, market is pretty competitive and tough. So at the same time, it is big and the subset of the markets which we're focusing growing much faster than global IT market. So I don't think might change from our standpoint in this. Clearly, big guys focusing more on this, smaller guys more excited to see how we're progressing, for example, but again market is growing very fast and demand is there. So the challenge, how to build right capabilities and how to upgrade our self kind of pretty dynamically. That's why, when all these questions, "What do you expect about future gross margin? Can you likely the size to benefit from this?" our answer are like -- seem pretty trivial. So we will have to reinvest to constantly kind of upgrade our self.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Vladimir Bespalov with VTB Capital.
Vladimir Bespalov: Congratulations on good results. I have a pretty specific one on your guidance. Now we can decompose your full year guidance into quarters. And when I look, for example, at non-GAAP and EPS guidance, I see a clear slowdown somewhere to 15% year-on-year growth in the third quarter and 10% year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter. There is also a pretty significant slowdown implied by your non-GAAP operating margins, so maybe you could provide some color what is behind this, the high base effect, the -- your reinvestments into developing the business. And I also see that R&D hiring has accelerated. Maybe you're hiring more people and this also affects our margins. This is the first question. And the second question I have, on maybe you could still provide us some color. As you talk to your clients right now and probably shaping up the profile for growth for the next year, what are the key risks? What are the key concerns from your clients that you see right now?
Jason Peterson: So I'll take the second half profitability questions. So really no change from what we've been thinking about the second half since we began providing guidance in terms of the overall levels of profitability. We've seen a little bit better profitability in the first half. And we -- for those of you doing models, and probably it's all of you, we're clearly expecting to operate in the top half of our 16% to 17% range. If you'll remember, Q4 of 2018, we actually ran it 18.4% non-GAAP adjusted IFO -- or adjusted IFO. That was at a time when we actually were over 80% from a utilization standpoint, so it was some outsized demand that popped in the quarter. And so we do not expect to be running at 18.4% adjusted IFO in Q4. So probably that's what you see when you see the change in, let's say, growth rate of EPS. But again, we continue to expect that we'll run in the high end of the -- of our 16% to 17% range for the full year, and again we feel quite good about profitability in the second half. And about next year and demand or risk or...
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, so on client concerns. I think they are very much in line with industry concerns, so we need to find the right capabilities and not just right capabilities but scalable ones. And scalability and change in skills profiles is an ability to put right teams together. It's one concern. The second concern actually too -- and this is again shared concern between clients and vendors, including EPAM. And for us it's very important, how to actually build what should bring value here, so just deliver engineering services. And a lot of clients are actually looking at us and asking us for thought leadership components to bring to the equation to help them actually to find the right solutions or just to build the right solutions. And I think we have kind of these three main points: this one; and again, more trivial, historically; repeatable scalability and capabilities one.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Arvind Ramnani with KeyBanc.
Arvind Ramnani: I really wanted to ask you about your recent acquisition of Competentum. It's certainly seems like a good strategic acquisition. How much of the value do you expect to extract based on using it internally for your own talent versus selling it to clients?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So the main focus is improve our capabilities in educational and publishing segments. So these guys have some competencies which are very complementing to what we have, and we're hoping that we will be able to penetrate this market much more aggressively than before. I think I've referred a really good offering in this area, but again that would really help. Plus, this company has a -- content development capabilities and learning platform development capabilities, which we -- potentially will enhance our internal offering. And internal here you can sync in the product sense internal for our employees and kind of internal/external for potential candidates of -- which we train externally to bring to the company as well. So that's -- that should impart this as well, but again the primary goal was still go to market.
Arvind Ramnani: Great. And how does that -- how are you looking to kind of sell it with -- will it be sold as a distinct offering, or will it be packaged with something else? And second part of the question is how does the firm actually generate its content? Is it all internally developed, or are they kind of using external authors to develop the content?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I would think about it as a -- improving our competencies in educational and publishing space because now we have added capabilities to go and build solution quicker because now we have extended the, like if you will, external expert in this field who build platform in this space. And that's what we're going to offer to the clients. With content, there is some -- again think about it's more in the competency sense. Now we have people who will be able to orchestrate some internal effort, but when you build content, you can utilize a number of external capabilities as well through the special metrics. So we just would be able to orchestrate it better, and more scalable environments.
Arvind Ramnani: Great. And just last question on this is did you also evaluate some external folks or some competitors such as Pluralsight or Skillsoft. Or was this mostly just kind of you really haven't looked at some of the other vendors?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So first of all, these guys not compete with the companies which you mentioned. These companies provide specifically engineering services, when I'm talking about external focus, external focus and education in general, around different areas. For example, one of the offerings which we now have which is around risk and compliance. When you're talking about these companies which you mentioned, then we have our internal offerings to the market kind of comparable with them because we already train thousands of people to create additional talent source for ourself. And we a looking at them, and sometimes we're utilizing -- well, pretty often utilizing external content as well when you're talking about specifically software engineering classes and so on.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from the line of David Grossman with Stifel.
David Grossman: Just a couple of very quick follow-ups here. Just on the utilization rate, I know you were running hot in the back half of last year. You're back down a couple of hundred bps. Is this about where you're comfortable? Or are you looking to bring it down even further?
Jason Peterson: Yes, as I think you know with utilization, it's going to vary based on quarter to a certain extent. And so then when you've got a quarter with more vacations, which is coming up, I think we've shown that we can kind of run around 77% to 78% pretty comfortably. There may be quarters we're above that. As you'll remember, that Q4 at 80% is a pretty hot number and probably takes a quarter where you get some unexpected demand. I'm not expecting that utilization would decline, and again I think probably this range in the 77% to 78% generally is probably a good way to think about the business.
David Grossman: All right. Great. And just on the head count adds. Just on a percentage basis it just looks like, over the last 12 months, adding more in the Ukraine and Russia -- just I don't know if there's anything to call out there. Or this is just the natural ebb and flow of just client demand and where there's available resources.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So it's a good question. So we would have been growing in the CIS, in Ukraine region. We also would be growing in India, where we're seeing good traction. And so this was a quarter where we didn't see so much of a shift towards in-market kind of talent. It was a more balanced kind of growth for us. And actually I'm quite pleased by the additions that we were able to make here in the quarter because I think it does show that we can continue to sort of produce the supply that we need to drive the business and to meet the demands of the marketplace.
David Grossman: So you're pretty satisfied with the current geographies, no need to add anything soon in terms of new supply time in the global...
Jason Peterson: I think you'll see us continue to evolve the business as Ark always talks about. And that could include incremental geographies, but I don't think you'll see any substantial or, let's say, radical change any time in the future. So pretty consistent. We, you are seeing substantial growth in Mexico, as we talked about. We've got a delivery center in Spain that's growing. Both of those are still relatively small, but we're seeing good uptake of resources in those centers.
David Grossman: Great. And then just lastly: Ark, you made some comments about consulting, I think, in your prepared remarks. I'm sorry. I missed some of that. So is there -- is this just the natural evolution of business where you're integrating consulting into the offering, as opposed to running it as a separate business line? Or is there more to it than that?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Well, it's consistent with what we shared before. We're building these capabilities, but we're still mostly focusing on how to bring integrated solution to our clients, not a separate -- not this kind of completely separate line of business. There are always some projects which is focusing on specific area, but again the goal is how to bring a complete end-to-end story.
Operator: Our next question is from Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company.
Mayank Tandon: Congrats on the results. Really a couple of quick ones here. Jason, you may have already mentioned this, but I just wanted to ask about the shift on the T&M side. Is that just a trend we should look for as the work becomes maybe more -- sorry, the shift towards fixed price as the work becomes more iterative with the digital-type work. And then I'd like to also ask just about the on site/offshore mix over time given the nature of the work. Is that going to result in more on-site-centric effort? Or does the model stay pretty much put where you have it today?
Jason Peterson: Okay. Yes, good questions. So from the standpoint of, I guess, the shift towards on site, as we continue to be increasingly relevant to clients as we take responsibility for larger programs, as we have larger, more strategic engagements, I think that necessitates higher in-market presence. And so I think you won't see it shift dramatically in any given quarter, but I think you're going to see a constant sort of uptick in the in-market head count. We've talked a little bit about what we think that looks like. We think that probably that's positive for us in terms of the relationships we have with our clients but maybe remains to be seen in terms of the overall impacts on the P&L. But again it's a very gradual shift, so I wouldn't expect anything to sort of pop up in the next couple quarters or anything. And it'll -- just kind of an ongoing march. And then from a fixed fee versus T&M. Most of the acquisitions that we've done have generally been companies that are more consultative in nature. And most of their engagements are fixed fee, but they're generally very short-term projects, right? So it's not on multiyear kind of fixed fee. It might be a project with 3 months or 6 months or maybe up to a year. And so a lot of what you've seen over the last maybe 6 quarters has been just a layering-in of revenues from Continuum and TH_NK and some of these companies. From time to time, we do have a client that might ask us to adjust some of the business from T&M to fixed fee, but that's not a -- it's not a significant trend for us. So it's mostly driven by the inorganic.
Mayank Tandon: Got it. Then one last one, on pricing. I don't know if you already commented, but what type of pricing tailwind are you building into your revenue guide for the year?
Jason Peterson: I don't think there's any change into what we've talked about in the past. So we continue to sort of, I think, do a good job of sort of price versus wage inflation. And so we haven't seen any significant changes in the last 90 days in that, and we continue to be quite focused on account margins. So it's a focus of the entire company and certainly of the executive leadership team.
Operator: Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Arkadiy Dobkin for closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're pretty pleased with Q2 results, and we hope that we will continue doing this. And again the challenge is, we mentioned, how to keep out -- in shape and challenge ourself to run fast. And thanks to all of our 30,000-plus people around the globe to help with this. And talk to you next time. And as usual, David is here to help with any additional inquiries. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-09 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the EPAM Systems First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. David Straube, Head of Investor Relations for EPAM Systems. Thank you. You may begin.
David Straube: Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company’s first quarter 2019 results. If you have not, a copy is available at epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today’s call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. Before I begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today’s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties as described in the company’s earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Dave and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. I would like to start with a few financial highlights of our first quarter. We delivered revenues of $521 million, reflecting 23% year-over-year growth or 26% in constant currency terms. In addition, we delivered strong non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.25, which represents 34% growth from Q1 of 2018. We believe our Q1 results have given us a solid start to the fiscal year and underscore our continued muted relevance in the market. We think it is especially important, taking in account our remark just 3 months back, when we mentioned macro level uncertainties, which everyone worried about it then and it seems like still do now at least based on recently reported performance of some regional market players. So at this point, we think our relevance has been owned through our nonstop focus on investing across the business, broadening our set of proceedings, developing our talent faster, and overall, constantly disrupting our sales to improve our chances as a company to be better prepared for the future. While it isn’t possible to share something significantly new in regards to what we did in Q1 versus previous period, I think a short summery could help serve as a reminder of what our focus is. So, we are continuously shaping our consulting cushion by strengthening our end-market teams and blending in new capabilities, which we added to EPAM during 2018 organically and by acquisitions. As indicated before, our goal is to build well-integrated consulting offering across business, experience and technology expertise. They should allow us to empower our historically strong project engineering capabilities and bring real value to our clients with the solutions we are delivering. During the last quarter, we saw a good level of progress in this direction. Also, we are continuously improving our product engineering capabilities across all global locations and constantly improving productivity, expertise and quality as well as the way of working and collaborating within our and clients’ teams by investing in our own digital platforms to support it. And we are continuously thinking about and testing in practice new services, new solutions and the alternative approaches to problem solving, which we didn’t consider or didn’t work in the past for us for one or another reason. And Q1 brought some new challenges forcing us to act outside of comfort zone and making us think differently and we are excited to address those, because it shows us a glimpse of the future. Finally, as a result of all of that, we are changing the company constantly and experimenting with different models of how we work internally and how we interact with clients and partners to address the challenges we are together encouraging and to improve the overall speed of everything we do. One good example of our non-stop evolution could be our digital platform strategy concept, which allows EPAM to connect across all our capabilities in consulting, design architecture and engineering and optimize overall delivery giving our clients a partner that can help them with a total engagement cycle from ideation to production run. Yes, we know, most likely you have heard that before from others in the industry, both in terms of the approach itself and probably even in brands and similarities. And it is true – it’s very difficult to differentiate yourself just on the message. The difference clearly is in execution where speed and quality of deliverables are critical and those are the function of thousands of small details, including the ability to orchestrate multi-functional and multi-locational teams while constantly improving productivity and eliminating waste. And also the difference is an unstoppable desire to put forth the extra effort to overcome a constantly growing number of new obstacles. Proving such differentiation points in practice over and over again is the only way to move forward and that’s the reason we are very excited to hear positive remarks from many of our clients about the impact of our efforts on their businesses. While they are also sharing how different and sometimes difficult because of that we are to work it, that are the reasons we are continuing to be optimistic about our future in the maybe broadly overused term digital ecosystem, where everything including clients, consumers, partners, suppliers and the employees, all blended together into scalable and flexible platform environment. So, our goal is simple. We want to enable our customers to be competitive and disruptive in the marketplace through such innovative solutions while helping them navigate successfully through multiple ways of technology changes. And today, we continue to see consistent demand across our main verticals and in our emerging verticals for our uniquely blended capabilities. To do pragmatic consulting around platforms, data and analytics, automation and engineering capabilities and to put that together with the full depth and breadth of EPAM Global Delivery machine, which we built in over the years. So at this point, I think we can repeat again as we did 3 months ago. Despite some of the macro level uncertainties, we are constantly watching and reading about, we are looking at 2019 optimistically. We are confident that we can continue to remain relevant to our diverse and global client base through our ability to execute lifescale digital transformation programs and to help them to make some very ambitious innovations, programs very real. With that said, let me turn the call over to Jason for more details on our Q1 results and update on our business outlook.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark. Good morning everyone. I will start with you on Q1 financial highlights, then talk about profitability, cash flow and end on guidance for the 2019 fiscal year and Q2. In the first quarter, we delivered solid top line performance, exceeded our profitability expectations and grew earnings per share. Here are a few key highlights from the quarter. Revenue came in at $521.3 million, a year-over-year growth of 22.9% on a reported basis or 26.3% growth in constant currency, reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of 3.4%. Looking at our first quarter revenue growth across our industry verticals, the drivers of growth remain very consistent and include digital transformation, an increased focus on customer engagement, product development and driving efficiencies and deeper insights through artificial intelligence, machine learning and analytics. Financial service is our largest vertical, delivered 9.1% reported or 13.3% constant currency growth year-over-year. Growth in Q1 was impacted by timing of revenue recognition for several financial services clients in Russia, in addition to the expected ramp down of activity at a few clients predominantly based in Europe. We continue to see increasing demand for our offerings in the payment processing and insurance space, which currently account for a modest share of revenues, but represent a rapidly growing part of our financial services portfolio. Travel and consumer grew 13.6% reported and 18.1% in constant currency terms. Growth in Q1 was impacted by the ramp down of [indiscernible] few consumer clients in Europe, along with muted growth for few clients based in North America. Software and high-tech grew 23.4% in the quarter. Business information and media posted 24.7% growth in Q1. Life sciences and healthcare grew 69.6%, reflecting broad-based growth across both industries and in existing and new client programs. And lastly, our emerging verticals delivered 40.7% growth driven primarily by clients in energy, telecommunications and automotive. From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region, representing 60.7% of our Q1 revenues, grew 32.2% year-over-year or 33% in constant currency. Europe, representing 33.3% of our Q1 revenues, grew 13.3% year-over-year or 19.3% in constant currency. CIS, representing 3.5% of our Q1 revenues, contracted year-over-year on both a reported and a constant currency basis, declining 16.6% and 4.1% respectively. Growth in this geography was impacted primarily by the timing of revenue recognition at several financial services clients. And finally, APAC grew 32.1% or 37.3% in constant currency and now represents 2.5% of our revenues. In the first quarter, growth in our top 20 clients was 15.5% and growth outside our top 20 clients was approximately 29% compared to the same quarter last year. Moving down the income statement, our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 33.9% compared to 34.5% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 36.3% compared to 36.5% for the same quarter last year. GAAP SG&A was 19.5% of revenue compared to 21.1% in Q1 of last year and non-GAAP SG&A came in at 17.7% of revenue compared to 19% in the same period last year, somewhat below the bottom end of the range that we target. GAAP income from operations was $64.7 million or 12.4% of revenue in the quarter compared to $48.7 million or 11.5% of revenue in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $89.2 million or 17.1% of revenue in the quarter compared to $67.7 million or 16% of revenue in Q1 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 5.4%, which includes $11.5 million excess tax benefit related to stock option exercises investing of restricted stock units. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes the excess tax benefit and certain one-time items, was 22.5%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.06 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.25, reflecting a 34.4% increase over the same quarter in fiscal 2018. In Q1, there were approximately 57.2 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operations for Q1 was negative $0.2 million compared to a positive $7.3 million in the same quarter last year. And free cash flow was negative $13.6 million compared to a negative $3.4 million in the same quarter last year. Cash flows this quarter were impacted by payments related to our annual variable compensation programs, which paid out at a higher level based on our 2018 performance and to a lesser extent an increase in DSO between Q4 and Q1. DSO was 78 days compared to 73 days at the end of Q4 fiscal 2018 and 83 days in the same quarter last year. We continue to be pleased with their DSO performance. Moving on to few operational metrics, we ended the quarter with over 27,800 delivery professionals, that’s 17.6% increase year-over-year, and a net addition of more than 1,100 production professionals during Q1. Our total headcount ended at more than 31,400 employees. Utilization was 79.9% compared to 77.6% in the same quarter last year and 80.2% in Q4. Now, let’s turn to guidance. Starting with fiscal 2019, revenue growth will continue to be at least 22% reported and at least 23% in constant currency terms after factoring a percent estimated unfavorable foreign exchange impact. We expect GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to now be approximately 12% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate to continue to be approximately 23%. Earnings per share, we now expect GAAP diluted EPS to be at least $4.61 for the full year and non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be at least $5.19, reflecting a modest improvement in expected profitability for the full year. We now expect weighted average share count of 58 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For Q2 of fiscal year ‘19, revenues will be at least $549 million for the second quarter, producing a growth rate of at least 23% reported and at least 24% in constant currency terms after factoring in an 1% estimated unfavorable foreign exchange impact. We expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 12% to 13% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%, reflecting a higher level of holidays in the CIS region and the impact of our annual compensation increases. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 9% and non-GAAP effective tax rate will be approximately 23%. Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $1.12 for the quarter and non-GAAP EPS will be at least $1.21 for the quarter. And lastly, we expect a weighted average share count of 57.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Finally a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock compensation expense is expected to be approximately $16.2 million in Q2, $15.2 million in Q3 and $15.6 million in Q4. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $2.4 million for each of the remaining quarters. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $2 million loss for the remainder of the year, with $1 million in Q2 and $500,000 in each of the remaining quarters. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments, is expected to be around $4.3 million in Q2 and approximately $4 million in each remaining quarter. We expect excess tax benefits to be around $10 million in Q2, $6.8 million in Q3 and $4.2 million in Q4. And lastly, given the amount of interest income we expect for fiscal 2019, we are adding an assumption related to interest and other income for the remainder of the year. We expect interest and other income to be $2.7 million for each of the remaining quarters. In summary, our Q1 results reflect solid demand for our services, underpinned by a diverse mix of projects and offerings across the industries we serve. We remain confident that our strategy combining our core engineering heritage with consulting, advanced technology and digital business services positions EPAM well for the future. With that, let’s open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Hi, Ark. Hi, Jason. Good start to the year.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: I guess my – let me start with the obvious question, I guess your first half growth was about 25% constant currency and the low end of your full-year outlook remains 23%. I think the Russia reference, not the full year factor, given it’s all about timing, not sure about the European client ramp downs you mentioned, any further details would be great there. But more importantly, if you’re expressing optimism on a full year basis, what keeps you from bringing up the low end of your year outlook?
Jason Peterson: So fair question. We feel good about how we’ve started Q1 and clearly, based on our guidance for Q2 feel good about the demand environment. What we are seeing is a couple of things, which is one is that we are seeing a little bit of a pullback in spending on European banking clients and that then forms our guidance for the full year. And in addition, we’re seeing a little bit of unevenness in demand associated with consumer and retail, primarily in Europe. And again what you’re seeing is some good strong growth across certain of our customers there and then what you’re seeing is a few customers where – whose business models are somewhat challenged and probably further challenged by uncertainty associated with Brexit who are pulling back a little bit on spending. And so the guidance, I would say, is thoughtful and again what we continue to see is strong demand overall across the business. You can see the growth rates in life sciences and healthcare. You can see the growth rates in high tech, in our emerging verticals. And so, we feel very good about the demand environment but we just want to be a little bit thoughtful as we enter Q2 about the remainder of the fiscal year.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And I would add that, Ashwin, traditionally that we project what we’re seeing right now. So what would happen in Q3, Q4, it’s – will be happening, but at this point we see this is [indiscernible]. So – and Q2 become – but the project is – so we increase the guidance. We don’t feel we can increase the guidance right now for the full year yet.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Understood. Now that’s good detail. I guess the second question is based on, at least our checks, digital transformation type contract sizes are increasing. That work, it continues to incorporate middle and back office, not just front-office type work. First, would you agree with that? And so – if so, can you talk about some of the changes that you continue to make internally with tools and so on to get a good level of incremental share from those bigger deals?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, definitely. Transformation impacts in not just front office but the whole stack of technology center, business processes center and business platforms. And while kind of simplistic understand of digital always was focusing on front-end, in our experience we always were very strongly engineering driven, as you know. And it means that we – traditionally, we’re working on development of the many core platforms for large product companies, helping them with this and then get an experience how to do implementation and customization of this. For this point we have the skills and during the last couple of years, we actually went down with the solutions for – and corporations and it’s changing us. And we’re investing a lot in advancing and modernization technologies for legacy systems and we have some progress – visible progress there as well. So now, we actually can optimize from end to end and that’s becoming bigger portion of our business but still on the development and very highly engineering customization points of view, not on managing or maintaining the legacy stock or [indiscernible].
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Thank you, guys. Good quarter.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Amit Singh: Hi, guys. This is actually Amit Singh. Great quarter overall. Just wanted to start off on a question related to the last question on financial services, so the pullback that you talk about among European clients, I wanted to get a sense of is this something new or has this has been going on for a while given your financial services revenue growth has been decelerating over the last few quarters? And also if you could update us on the health of the financial services clients in North America and then how should we look at your overall vertical growth going forward? Should we expect the growth to further decelerate from here?
Jason Peterson: Right. So, thanks for that question. So the first thing I want to focus on is just the overall demand environment for the company. So, we have always talked about the company having a broad series of sort of what I would refer to as growth engines, that’s both new and existing clients, and then what you can see is that we’re able to deliver growth across a broad range of verticals. New vertical at EPAM constitutes more than 22% of revenue and that would be financial services. We are actually seeing very strong growth in fin tech, in asset management, in card payment and processing and we’re beginning to see some very exciting growth then actually with our insurance customers, which today make up a small part of our business, but we expect to grow relatively rapidly in both the near and the midterm. So, we’ve got a lot of sources of growth inside financial services and what we’re just seeing in a handful of banking clients, we just want to acknowledge that there has been a little bit of pull-back there and that’s what then forms our guidance. As Ark said, what we want to do is guide for the full year to what we can see today and again the – somewhat of a reduction that we saw in Q1 forms the guidance for the remainder of the year.
Amit Singh: Okay, perfect. And then if you could provide a little bit more – you talked about consulting and I believe your overall consulting employees were around 2,000 maybe a quarter or so ago. How has that changed over the last quarter? And then related to that, as you’re adding more of these consulting capabilities and people, should it have an impact on your long-term margins because based on your current guidance, it seems like this year you will likely be toward the upper end of that 16% to 17% range?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, during the previous calls, we kind of touched on this and our message was that we’re not trying to create a separate line of business, which is consulting, rather than create integrated solution then from advising to delivering and optimizing actually the end result. And this is still to go. So, it’s very difficult. We don’t have even like specific headcount on consulting is – pure consulting services, because it’s more like attribute of multiple professionals in EPAM which play in specific roles and specific engagements. So very difficult to answer questions with metrics and so on because we’re measuring and trying to measure this on the end results. The number of people in market increasing but – and we play in to increase, how this will impact the margin, so in general, profitably on end market – margins on end market people, a little bit lower than our global delivery centers from our point of view. As the same time, the consultative behavior and consultative type of engagement growing and we are seeing that some of this is bringing us different marginality of the clients, because we are getting whole year engagements. We can advise and we can actually work with clients in a very different manner. So, we do see that it’s not going to impact our margin in a long time, but investment is necessary and our kind of guidance is what we are communicating right now.
Amit Singh: Alright. Perfect, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Maggie Nolan: Good morning. So Ark, in your prepared remarks you talked about some new challenges that you faced in Q1. Is this some of the vertical specific challenges that you outlined on the call? Are there other challenges that were happening during the first quarter? Can you elaborate a little bit on those? And then also you kind of tie that into the ability to create new solutions or services? Is there anything there in particular that stands out as something that could be an interesting development for the business or a growth driver for the business?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. I think it’s kind of two questions. In reality, it is exactly overlapping and one thing for us because the challenges coming from – and clearly there is multiple challenges in Q1 – just confirmation of this trend over different quarters because we have it constantly, but what I talking about – about some challenges coming from the new type of services which we bring from our internal disruption going to some areas where we not necessarily know all answers. And as – almost as a rule, when clients don’t know the answers as well, otherwise they wouldn’t be coming to us. And it’s great challenge is how to do new type of projects, new type of engagement with new type of capabilities. And with our organic kind of internal disruption and bringing new capabilities through acquisitions, we’re creating opportunities to go to this unknown situation and test new type of ideas and solutions and services. And that’s what I was kind of referring to earlier today.
Maggie Nolan: Okay, I understand. And then, as you think about kind of these new engagements and more of these transformational type of engagements, of the business that you’ve been winning, how much of that would you characterize this transformational? And then on the pipeline as well, are you seeing an increase in the transformational deals in the pipeline and any quantification of that would be appreciated. Thanks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I cannot give you like specific numbers, but it’s definitely increasing pretty rapidly the type of deals come to us where it’s a critical transformational effort or initiative from the client base, like 3, 4 years ago it was single. Now, probably we participate in dozens of this type of engagement.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Bryan Bergin: Hi, thank you. A follow-up here on the consulting and design services, can you give us a sense of the base of clients that you have penetrated with those offerings? Are you having success winning new engagements by leading with these offerings? I am curious if there are relationships starting that have different counterparts than your traditional target in a client?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I am sorry. Can you repeat?
Bryan Bergin: Yes, sure. So with respect to the consulting design services, how much of the base of your existing clients have you penetrated with those services? And then with respect to – if you are leading with this offering, are you dealing with different people and different counterparts at the client then you traditionally would be?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, probably penetration with this type of service is pretty deep. So it’s – again we’re not giving specific numbers, but it’s way over 50% of our business, like probably closer to 70%, 80%, and type of people, we interact broadening but it’s still a lot of interaction with IT people, because actually the companies it’s serious about is involving IT operation in cooperation with business and with digital leadership working together. So I think we’re seeing more and more different characters on client side, but IT is still driving a big portion of this because complex platforms without technology practically impossible to deliver.
Bryan Bergin: Okay, that makes sense. Alright. And then just on talent sourcing, you continue to show a nice separation between headcount and revenue growth. Do you think this is sustainable? Can you talk about the hiring ramp there and then the competition also for talent, any changes?
Arkadiy Dobkin: No, I think on separation there is nothing new here. So we’re indicating multiple times with a structure of this and I think it continues to be the same. It’s slightly increasing in our case and short presence, new contracts come in with better rates. So this promotion inside of the existing contracts because of accumulated experience of our people, and that’s practically the same growth proportion from revenue which we’ve seen. And the second question was about challenges as far as sourcing...
Bryan Bergin: Yes, talent – the competition for talent, any changes there still playing?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, we don’t have any easier way to do it. So we still – it’s still very tough market and investments in training, investment in people, in retention, in allocation, very important, plus clearly the type of interesting deals which we run and bringing us opportunity to attract more talented components of the workforce.
Bryan Bergin: Okay. Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: But challenge is there, sorry, absolutely.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Mayank Tandon: Thank you. Good morning. Good quarter again. Jason, maybe you could parse through the revenue profile going forward in terms of your headcount plans, any potential for further improvement in utilization and also what type of pricing tailwinds you’re building into your expectations for the rest of the year?
Jason Peterson: That’s a fair question. So from a pricing standpoint, as Ark indicated, is that if you are doing a revenue per head count is there is an ongoing gradual shift toward somewhat more talent in market, so that have a positive uplift, OK. As Ark also indicated, we just did our promotions cycle, we usually have a certain amount of rate alignment after that and then we continue to get price increases at existing customers, and with newer customers and other opportunities there is potential for pricing as well. So, what we’re looking at right now is an environment that probably is somewhat similar to what we’ve seen in past time periods and probably a similar level of wage inflation, certainly not an elevated level wage inflation. And so, I think that, that sort of bodes for a fairly consistent sort of pricing and wage inflation environment. From a utilization standpoint and I do need to make this clear around sort of that quaternization or seasonality of our business, what we usually see is a first half of our fiscal year has got lower available we capacity or what other companies called bill days. And so, in our environment, we’ve got significant holidays associated with Orthodox Christmas, in Q1 we’ve got significant holidays associated with May in the CIS region in Q2. So, we have fewer available working days and as a result, that usually has a somewhat negative impact on profitability. And in the second half, we’ve got more available working days. And then you see a general improvement of profitability and you’ll see that in our patterns throughout the last couple of years. And so, right now we’re running at a relatively high-level utilization. We think we’ll run at a higher level than we have in past years but I would expect a modest decline in utilization as we go from Q1 to Q2, in part because of the elevated vacations associated with May.
Mayank Tandon: Great, that’s helpful color. And then if I can just follow-up on the verticals, could you provide any more details on what the emerging verticals comprise? And also, how are you thinking about expanding into new areas, either through M&A or organically?
Jason Peterson: Okay, that’s fair. So, from a from the emerging standpoint, there is a series of customers in there but we generally sort of focus on energy, which has been strong growth here in Q1. We’re seeing good growth in automotive and then we’re seeing some interesting activity and growth in telecommunications. From an M&A standpoint, a lot of the focus has been on developing incremental sort of in-market consulting capability, and then there’s also probably some opportunities to get some additional sort of skills and talents. But probably the focus from an M&A strategy standpoint has not changed dramatically. We’re still focused more on sort of consulting capabilities in market.
Mayank Tandon: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.
Joseph Foresi: Hi. I wanted to get a sense of demand and I wanted to ask the question this way. How much of the engagements that are coming in or the new engagements or the new work that’s coming in are new engagements versus takeaways? And have you seen any shift in that work? I know there’s traditionally been brand new engagements.
Arkadiy Dobkin: You mean that new engagements and existing clients?
Joseph Foresi: Yes. Is that still primarily new work or is that more takeaways and have you seen any shift there?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it’s approximately it’s very difficult sometimes to qualify what is new engagement or not, especially in the modern this platform, build out, because it’s usually extension of something which you were doing before. But I don’t think there is any shift in this. There is new initiative still and there is continuation of kind of large sub-components of the platform development, and most of this all connect it as well.
Jason Peterson: And so, that our consistent trend has been that if you look at the incremental revenue dollars on a year-over-year basis, that 60% of incremental revenue dollar comes from existing clients and 40% of the incremental revenue dollar comes from new clients. And so, that trend stays pretty consistent. Again, we continue to grow quite rapidly as many of our largest and longest-standing customers, and we continue to get quite a bit of incremental revenue from new customer engagements.
Joseph Foresi: That’s very helpful. Yes. And then my second one, I guess I’ll ask about guidance again and I’ll ask it differently. On the margin side, they seem to want to continue to go up. What are the levers there? Why not take a look at the guidance for the full year on the margin side and what keeps you conservative on that side? Thanks.
Jason Peterson: Okay. And so, our guidance does indicate that we have somewhat more confidence that we can run the business at a somewhat higher level of profitability than what we thought when we began the fiscal year. So, to that take-up in EPS reflect some of that sense that we can incrementally improve profitability. But I think as we look at the business, we want to make certain that we continue to invest in the business that does have some amount of SG&A related investment. And I think gross margin will be sort of relatively consistent with what we saw last year. And so, I think its kind of informed by the desire to continue to invest in the business. And as Ark talked about, the notion of, let’s say, challenges with customers is that we are bringing additional capabilities to market. We’re filling in with capabilities that maybe we haven’t historically had. We’re learning from that. Our clients are learning from that. We think it makes us more relevant to clients and then it supports our growth long-term, which is expected to continue to be in excess of 20% per year.
Joseph Foresi: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Moshe Katri: Hi, thanks, good morning. Is there a way to quantify the impacts from the ramp-downs on revenue growth for the quarter? And then as a follow-up, you mentioned that fin tech and insurance are both offsetting the weakness in the traditional banking business in Europe. Can you give us a maybe some color which percentage of the overall financial services vertical these two emerging growth areas account for? Thanks a lot.
Jason Peterson: Yes, I think I probably wouldn’t spend a lot of time with this moment sort of dissecting different components of the financial services practice. What I can say is that we’ve got a significant series of growth opportunities in the fin tech. We’ve talked about insurance, which is small and we think rapidly growing. But then I’m going to pull back and just kind of talk about the business overall, is that EPAM has always had a broad source of growth opportunities across industry verticals, across both new and existing clients. And so, I think how I would speak about both the quarter and the full fiscal year is despite some softness in spending with banks, the Company is continuing to grow our business in excess of 20% per year, in part because we are not dependent on financial services as a source of growth for the Company. I think I look long term I think the other thing that I would say is that historically and today would be no different, we continue to be relatively more supply constrained than we’ve ever been demand constrained. So even if there is a modest reduction in demand across a couple of customers, oftentimes what you’ll find in more than often almost always is there is an opportunity to deploy resources in other accounts.
Moshe Katri: Thanks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: We ensure it will be very kind of quickly resolve client concentration, and we don’t think there is any danger that even if one client will go down, we wouldn’t be able to handle it or a couple of clients. And historically, that’s exactly what’s happening multiple times during the last 5 years, 6 years, so never impacted our overall growth. So, unless the broader economic changes somewhere, we feel free pretty confident.
Moshe Katri: Helpful, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arvind Ramnani with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Arvind Ramnani: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just had a question regarding your earlier commentary on some of the softer spend at some of the specific banks in Europe. Is it mostly related to Brexit or is there some of the banks going through some in-sourcing as well?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It might be combination of this. So, because some banks going through insourcing conveys so and we’re hearing about it for a very long time, at the same time even our big banks while not necessarily very optimistic part of the story, it is pretty kind of control story for us at this point. But what exactly driving this, it’s very difficult to answer, because we don’t have direct answers as well when we’re asking this question.
Arvind Ramnani: Great. And as it pertains to Brexit, I mean clearly there is some uncertainty now and maybe some slowdown in spending. But do you think that the slowdown as it pertains to Brexit is temporary and once there’s clarity and if things kind of separate things could – the next 12 months to 18 months spending could actually accelerate?
Arkadiy Dobkin: My answer probably would be a little bit funny, but if you think it’s every everything is temporary and we saw so many changes like during the last year. So, it always was going some clients were going down and then going up. I’m pretty sure that Brexit is not a permanent thing. Life will make some changes, replacement and demand will come back. Is it going to be slowed down for 6 months or 18 months, that’s all, I don’t know, or maybe not at all impact.
Arvind Ramnani: Great. And just kind of on the recruiting environment, given that Luxoft is now being absorbed by DXC, has it made the recruiting environment easier or has that continued to be difficult to recruit?
Arkadiy Dobkin: With all respect to EPAM and to Luxoft, I don’t think that creates any impact on the overall recruitment situation across Europe. So, because it’s a much bigger ecosystem. I think in general, it’s still challenging and we bring in all our auctions about where we’re going, where we recruit, how are we doing this? We play in kind of assumption that it would be real challenge. So, and I don’t think situation with Luxoft changes the labor market in anyway.
Arvind Ramnani: Great, thank you. Good luck for...
Arkadiy Dobkin: Definitely not simplifying the market.
Arvind Ramnani: Sounds great. Thank you. Good luck for remainder of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vladimir Bespalov with VTB Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Vladimir Bespalov: Hello. Congratulations on the good results and thank you for taking my questions. My first question will be on revenues per delivery professional, so if my calculations are correct, I see some decrease in revenues per diluted professional in the first quarter even though the utilization rate was pretty high and close to what you saw in the fourth quarter. Could you comment a little bit what is behind this and how this should develop going forward? And my second question will be on capital allocation strategy. I know that you are always considering M&A activity, but still you have a lot of cash on your balance sheet. So, are you thinking any other ways of using this cash, for example, share buybacks or dividend distribution or whatever? Thank you.
Jason Peterson: Yes. And so, on the first question, when we do the calculation that I think you’re doing, what we would see is that revenue per headcount actually is increasing. Maybe what you’re saying is that revenue the growth in revenue per headcount is not at exactly the same level as we’ve seen in, let’s say, the last couple of quarters. And the one thing that is an important factor is foreign exchange, and so when we do that we do that calculation just so we can kind of understand your perspective, is that both you have to look at foreign exchange in utilization and from a growth in revenue per headcount, if you adjust for those two factors, the growth in revenue per headcount is pretty consistent with what we’ve seen in past quarters.
Arkadiy Dobkin: In constant currency.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So, you’ve got adjust for foreign exchange as [indiscernible] constant currency and then utilization. And then from the standpoint of capital allocation is – as you indicate, we continue to have an inorganic strategy and that will consume capital. And we’re evaluating opportunities for, let’s say for a capital allocation strategy overtime, but nothing that we would announce and wouldn’t announce a change at this time.
Vladimir Bespalov: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Darrin Peller: Thanks guys. Couple of quick questions; one higher level question is just a kind of question about competition at RFPs [Technical Difficulty] different kind of trends, and honestly it sounds like the backdrop in the demand environment is very strong, but we see certain kinds of competitors that seem to be struggling based on the kinds of tax. So, I guess first of all, are you seeing different players go head-to-head with you for the same kinds of deals that you’re competing for now than maybe you’ve seen you would have seen two years ago? Are there just different people in the room? And then from a backdrop standpoint and end market, is consolidation whether it’s in healthcare, it’s in financial services, has that been impacting you guys as well of your clients, not shown as much as, let’s call it, like a March budget release versus what you’ve seen in past? We’ve just heard something like that from other some of your competitors as well, so I’d love to hear a little more color on that please.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think there are some movements in type of services which different companies provide. But in general, I think its pretty consistent group our competitors which we’ve seen. While I’m seeing it’s quite consistent, it’s still very broad from very big multinational system integrators and some local company focused on very specific competencies. So, that was for us was the case like 5 years, 6 years ago and I think its very similar right now, with exceptions that while we go in for the bigger deals, we’re seeing big guys more often than before. So, the second question, I didn’t it was a little bit breaking on you. Can you repeat the second question?
Darrin Peller: Yes, I was trying to figure out if you guys there’s been consolidation among the client base, so certain healthcare clients are merging or financial banks are merging. Are you seeing that impact the demand environment at all? And to some degree, we also heard that there was less of a budget release in March where some of these some of your clients might actually finalize their budget for the year than prior years. It doesn’t sound like you saw that but I’m curious.
Jason Peterson: Yes, I mean we’re clearly seeing extremely strong demand in healthcare and life sciences and on both sides of that, and so we’re not seeing a slowdown associated with a budget release or a lack of budget release.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, and also, the risk consolidation in [indiscernible] is well. So, some big companies by getting in different groups, and that’s happening with us as well, which is creating potentially several clients with difference strategy growing on us. But I don’t think consolidation was an issue for us so far.
Darrin Peller: All right. And then just one quick financial question, Jason. I mean when I look at the free cash flow numbers, it came in a little below what we expected. Just curious to hear what I think you touched on it a bit in your prepared remarks what happened in the quarter. But if you could give us a little more color on what you expect for the year from your free cash flow? And what did M&A contribute in the quarter and maybe what just remind us what you expect again for the year?
Jason Peterson: Sure, so I’ll take the last question first. So, M&A contributed about 200 basis points of growth in Q1. For the full year, we’d expect that M&A would contribute about 100 basis points of growth. And then in terms of the coming in low versus your model, are you referring to cash flow or profitability or revenue or what specific...
Darrin Peller: Free cash, the free cash flow number I’m talking about.
Jason Peterson: Yes. So, I mean, quite honestly there’s two major values there. One would be the variable compensation element and we had a very strong 2018 and as a result, there was a relatively higher level of variable compensation paid out. So, that’s one. And then DSO increased again from 73 days to 78 days, but 78 days is still very good DSL for us, you’ll note that we’ve run in the 80s in the past. And so, I’m still quite happy with the DSO. But it’s really the somewhat elevated level of variable compensation payout due to the that high-level performance we had in 2018 and to a lesser extent, the impact of the increase in DSO. So, in I guess if I would add one more thing, we’re quite seasonal from a cash generation standpoint. And so, in Q1, you would have the variable compensation. You have a little bit of variable compensation in Q2 and our strongest cash-generation quarters are usually again in the second half of the year.
Darrin Peller: Got it. Okay, thanks again.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back to Mr. Dobkin for any final comments.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you for joining us today. So just to summarize, I think it should be clear from this call that with all the noises happening around us, which is nothing new and practically constant, we do feel pretty strong about the year and I think Q1 confirming this. And see you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-14 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the EPAM Systems Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. David Straube, Head of Investor Relations for EPAM Systems. Thank you. You may begin.
David Straube: Thank you, operator. And good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results. If you have not, a copy is available at epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President, and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. Before I begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP and are available in our quarterly earnings material located on the Investor section of our website. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We finished this year in a strong position across several dimensions of our business. Financially, we delivered a revenue of $1.84 billion, reflecting 27.1% year-over-year reported growth or 26.9% in constant currency terms. And non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.38 or 26% increase over fiscal 2017. Additionally, we generated free cash flow of $255 million. 2018 was an important year for us. First of all, at the end of December, we celebrated our 25th anniversary. The real significance of that year for us was to prove that, while we have been in business for 25 years, we still act, change, grow and feel like a very young and dynamic company. So, in 2018, we tirelessly continued to expand our capabilities and working to driving deeper connection with clients. And we have done this organically through very selective acquisitions and by growing some of our more strategic partner relationships.  As we look across our portfolio of clients, it's clear to see that the types of engagements we are executing today and type of demand we're seeing for the future is broader than pure engineering. This is the change that we have talked about before in terms of how we view our investments and capabilities. 2018 was a remarkable year for us to observe the shift from pure software product development programs to much more complex scale and business critical engagements for our clients. So, today, with all our expanding capabilities, many of which have been recognized by industry analysts as increasingly vital accelerators, we're not longer just a software engineering company as the core, but also a strong design and experience consultancy, growing business and innovation consultancy, as well as emerging training and educational firm. While stating that, I would like to stress that a very important, if not critical, effort across those many still-relatively-new capabilities for us is that we bring those capabilities to our clients in the form of very aligned multifunctional teams, which operate with one common goal – to realize overall value of the solution for client benefit versus just new and potentially overlapping streams of revenue for EPAM. This type of integrated change is very challenging to perform predictably in complex enterprise environments because they require careful balance between executing proved strategies and bringing in new and strategic capabilities. And while we believe that, ultimately, we can – and will – grow our share of trust with our clients, and in doing so, grow our topline as well, we are looking at these challenges from the constant perspective of the value add to clients, to keep their interest as a priority. While it's easy to frame these accomplishments in the context of our last fiscal year, they're really progression points of longer journey we are on to continuously disrupt our sales to meet the complex demands of the digital ecosystem type of engagements, which requires us to respond with speed, agility and the right capabilities at the right place and time. As we look at our evolution and our ability to deliver the type of growth we expect as a 25-years-old startup, we continue to focus significant efforts on developing our people through investments in our talent management, educational and delivery platforms that help us to scale, engage and retain our engineering consulting design and managing capabilities globally. During the year, we added over 4,200 people, hiring across the organization in all our delivery centers and key end market locations and significantly strengthened our talent pool across the globe. With all that, and despite some of the macro-level uncertainties, which we're constantly watching and reading about, we are looking at 2019 optimistically. We believe that we can continue to remain very relevant to our diverse and global client base through our ability to execute life-scale digital transformation programs and to help them to make some ambitious innovation programs very real. I will turn it over to Jason for a detailed financial update of last year and our guidance for this 2019.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark. And good morning, everyone. I'll start with 2018 financial highlights, then talk about profitability, cash flow and end on guidance for the 2019 fiscal year and Q1. In the fourth quarter, we delivered very strong topline performance, exceeded our profitability expectations and grew earnings per share. Here are a few key highlights from the quarter. Revenue came in at $504.9 million, a year-over-year growth of 26.5% on a reported basis and 28.9% growth in constant-currency, reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of 2.4%. Looking at our fourth quarter revenue growth across industry verticals, the drivers of growth remain very consistent, and include digital transformation and increased focus on customer engagement, product development and driving efficiencies and deeper insights through artificial intelligence, machine learning and analytics. Financial services, our largest vertical, delivered 16.9% reported and 21.1% constant currency year-over-year growth. Growth in Q4 was impacted by continued expected ramp down of activity at a few clients outside of our top five, predominantly based in Europe. Travel and consumer grew 17.3% reported and 20.6% in constant currency terms. Growth in Q4 was impacted by slowdown within certain consumer clients in Europe. Software and hi-tech grew 26% in the quarter. Business information and media posted 24% growth in Q4. Life sciences and healthcare grew 71.3%, reflecting broad-based growth across all industries in existing and new client programs. And lastly, our emerging verticals delivered 38.1% growth, driven primarily by clients in energy, telecommunications and automotive. From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region, representing 61.6% of our Q4 revenues, grew 36.9% year-over-year or 37.5% in constant currency. Europe, representing 31.2% of our Q4 revenues, grew 12.1% year-over-year or 15.2% in constant currency. CIS, representing 4.4% of our Q4 revenues, contracted 4.8% year-over-year and grew 11.3% in constant currency. Growth in this geography was impacted primarily by an unusual compare from Q4 2017 and foreign exchange. And, finally, APAC grew 68.1% or 72.5% at constant currency and now represents 2.8% of our revenues. In the fourth quarter, growth in our top 20 clients was approximately 22% and growth outside our top 20 clients was approximately 30% compared to the same quarter last year.  Moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 36.8% compared to 36.4% in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 37.7% compared to 38% for the same quarter last year. GAAP SG&A was 19.3% of revenue compared to 21.4% in Q4 of last year and non-GAAP SG&A came in at 17.7% of revenue compared to 19.7% in the same period last year. SG&A was somewhat lower than expected due to a one-time benefit in addition to a high-level of revenue growth during the quarter. GAAP income from operations was $78.3 million or 15.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to $52.1 million or 13% of revenue in Q4 last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $93.1 million or 18.4% of revenue in the quarter compared to $66.9 million or 16.8% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 23.9%, which includes one-time tax charges of $1.7 million, partially offset by a $1.2 million excess tax benefit related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes the excess tax benefit and certain one-time items, was 23.2%. Both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates reflect the updated tax structure implemented in response to the 2017 US tax reform act. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.05 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.27, reflecting a 25.7% increase over the same quarter in fiscal 2017. In Q4, there were approximately 56.9 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operations for Q4 was $123.1 million compared to $71.2 million in the same quarter last year. And free cash flow was $113 million compared to $58.3 million in the same quarter last year, resulting in a 156% conversion of adjusted net income. DSO was 73 days compared to 81 days at the end of Q3 fiscal 2018, and 81 days in the same quarter last year. The lower-than-average DSO this quarter was the result of our ongoing operational focus in this area. Moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended the quarter with over 26,700 delivery professionals, a 16.4% increase year-over-year and a net addition of more than 1,500 production professionals during Q4. Our total headcount ended at more than 30,100 employees. Utilization was 80.2% compared to 78.8% in the same quarter last year and 76.4% in Q3. We do expect that utilization will trend somewhat lower and in the range of 77% to 79% over the next few quarters. Turning to our results for the fiscal year. Revenues for the fiscal year closed at $1.84 billion or 27.1% reported growth over 2017 or constant-currency growth of 26.9%. Our acquisitions in fiscal 2018 contributed approximately 200 basis points to our growth.  GAAP income from operations increased 42.1% year-over-year and represented 13.3% of revenue for the year. Our non-GAAP income from operations was $315.1 million, an increase of 34.3% over the prior year and represented 17.1% of revenue. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the year came in at 3.8%, which includes the one-time impact of our updated tax structure in response to the 2017 US tax reform. Excluding the impact of this legislation and other adjustments, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21. 9%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $4.24. Non-GAAP EPS, which excludes adjustments for tax reform, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related costs, was $4.38, reflecting a 26.6% increase over fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2018, there were approximately 56.7 million diluted shares outstanding. In fiscal 2018, cash flow from operations was $292.2 million compared to $192.8 million for fiscal 2017. And free cash flow came in at $254.6 million, reflecting a 102.7% adjusted net income conversion. Now, let's turn to guidance. Starting with fiscal 2019, revenue growth for fiscal 2019 will be at least 22% reported; and in constant-currency terms will be at least 23% after factoring a 1% estimated unfavorable foreign exchange impact. We expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%, and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 16% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23%, which reflects the full-year operating and our updated tax structure implemented in response to the 2017 US tax reform. Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be at least $4.45 for the full year and non-GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $5.06 for the full year. We expect weighted average share count of 57.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For Q1 of fiscal year 2019, revenues will be at least $518 million for the first quarter, producing a growth rate of at least 22% reported and at least 25% in constant currency after factoring in a 3% estimated unfavorable foreign exchange impact. For the first quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 12% to 13% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 12% and non-GAAP effective tax rate will be approximately 23%. Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $1 for the quarter and non-GAAP EPS will be at least $1.16 for the quarter. We expect the weighted average share count of 57.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock compensation expense is expected to be approximately $64.3 million, with $18.3 million in Q1 and approximately $15.3 million in each remaining quarter. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $9.4 million for the year, evenly spread across each quarter. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $1.2 million loss for the year, spread evenly across each quarter. Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $16.6 million for the year, with $4.5 million in Q1 and approximately $4 million in each remaining quarter. Lastly, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $23 million for the full year, with approximately $7.1 million in Q1, $6.8 million in Q2, $5.6 million in Q3, and $3.4 million in Q4. In summary, our 2019 outlook reflects continued strong demand for our services, underpinned by the diverse set of industries we serve, from which we expect a range of growth opportunities as they grow through their natural cycles. We remain confident that our strategy of combining our core engineering heritage with advanced technology and digital business services positions EPAM well for the future.  With that, let's open the call up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Good morning, Ark. Good morning, Jason. And congratulations. My first question is, Ark, you started off mentioning a high degree of confidence entering 2019. And I'm wondering how this translates to the financial model. Is there higher visibility? Maybe higher than the normal 80% to 90% range. Or is it the slightly higher starting point for growth? And then, also, how does it factor into your hiring plans?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Hi, Ashwin. Yeah. We have good level of confidence, but it's not coming that it's something unusual, it's more like because it's in line with what you have seen before, which, as you would suspect, giving us a good feel. But after growing pretty highly during the several years before, we're still carrying the same level of visibility and confidence. I think that's the answer to this. And in regards to talent acquisition, you probably would suspect my usual answer. It's very challenging and it was challenging and will be challenging. But we, again, feel confident we would be able to support the necessary level of growth with what we see in the labor market.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Got it. And then, the follow-up there is on the cash flow. Jason, good job there on the cash flow conversion, the DSO level. Would you say ahead for 2019 that DSO level might be sustainable? Is there a target that you can give us with regards to cash flow conversion? Yeah.
Jason Peterson: Yeah. Certainly, a nice improvement as we went to 73 in Q4. What we usually see in Q1 is a certain – almost a seasonal impact with DSO where people have got to get paperwork and things in place. And our clients doing that actually results in sort of a delay in some of the invoicing processes. So, we usually do see DSO actually creep up somewhat. I am expecting that we'll probably end up something approaching the 80 number. So, it should be below the levels that we saw in 2018, but it's certainly going to be somewhat higher than what we saw as we exited Q4. However, there's a strong focus on DSO, and so we'll kind of keep you posted as we go throughout the year. The other thing I'd just want to remind you of is we do have kind of a seasonal pattern when it comes to cash flow. We usually have strong cash flow in both Q3 and Q4 of the fiscal year. And then, in Q1, we've got that variable compensation element, and that has paid substantially in Q1 and we also have a cash-settled RSU payment that's made. And so, you usually see a much lower level of cash flow generation in Q1. And also, somewhat lower level in Q2 because you also have a little bit of the variable compensation element paid there as well. So, I just want to remind people of that, that, in addition, to having some seasonality on the profitability front, you also see a little bit of seasonality from a cash flow generation standpoint.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Thank you, guys. Congratulations again.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Amit Singh: Hi, guys. This is actually Amit Singh. Just quickly wanted to talk about the adjusted operating margins. This quarter was obviously very strong at 18.4%. I guess the strongest since, I think, the second quarter of 2012. So, if you could talk about what led to that strong margins in the quarter? I know utilization has gone up to above 80 [indiscernible]. So, a little bit of color there would be helpful.
Jason Peterson: Yeah. So, first off, the beat on the revenue clearly helps in other ways, right? It kind of supports the SG&A efficiency and, generally, it leads to higher utilization. So, as you point out, we have the higher utilization, high revenue overall. SG&A was somewhat lower than we had expected, and there was kind of a one-time effect that I don't think that you would see in future quarters. And so, it could be the – the higher utilization, we usually have pretty good sort of calendar day availability or bill days in Q4, and then just the overall SG&A efficiency.  If I were to kind of take you forward to Q1, usually, what you see is you see quite a bit lower bill days for EPAM in Q1. And then, the T&M business bill days will impact your adjusted IFO. And that's because you've got a lot more holidays in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine in that time period with kind of the Orthodox Christmas – or Eastern Orthodox Christmas, right? Then, we probably have slightly lower utilization. And then, I do want to make certain that everyone understands that we do expect that SG&A will go back to a rate more on our 18% to 19%. So, as we exited Q4, we were below 18% as a percentage of revenue. And then, I expect in both Q1 and for the remainder of the fiscal year that we'll operate in the 18% to 19% range.
Amit Singh: All right. Perfect. So, just a follow-up to this for fiscal 2019 guidance. You're guiding to 16% to 17% when we look at the full year. And you ended this year, for the full year, at the higher end of that range. So, at the midpoint, why should overall margins decline? And then, also, if you are looking at topline, at the beginning of the year, so I understand that you want to be cautious and see how things play out. But you ended the year at around 27% topline growth in constant currency. And the guidance for next year is 23%. So, if you could explain these two, on margins and topline, and also just add to how M&A is contributing sort of next year.
Jason Peterson: Yes, let me start with the end. And so, first off, with the 27% on the constant currency, we would have had a 2% benefit from M&A, specifically the Think and Continuum acquisitions. In 2019, we expect that there will be a 1% benefit. So, if I were to look at the constant currency growth rate, we're guiding to an at least 22% growth rate for 2019, which is actually consistent with the growth rate that we guided to in 2018. From an overall kind of profitability standpoint, we are going to continue to make the investments that we need to continue to grow the business at greater than 20% a year. Again, we expect that that will mean that we'll return SG&A back to an 18% to 19% range. And we continue to get all of the price increases and wage inflation continues to be kind of within our expectations and kind of within our recent history. And so, we believe we'll continue to manage the business very much in that 16% to 17% range, again, with the idea that we want to be able to make the investments that allow us to continue to grow the business not just in 2019, but into the future. I guess, the only other thing I'm going to point out is just that we do – you did have that very strong exit and it was a great quarter and a great fiscal year in 2018. However, you do have seasonal patterns. And so, generally, what we find is the first half of the year has got a lower level of profitability than the second half of the year, and I expect that you'll see that pattern again in 2019.
Amit Singh: All right. Perfect. Thank you very much.
Jason Peterson: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Maggie Nolan: Good morning. I want to follow-up to that M&A contribution question. I think you said 1% for the full-year 2019. What's the contribution in the first quarter specifically? And what was the contribution in the fourth quarter of 2018 as well?
Jason Peterson: Yeah, great question. So, in the first quarter, we expect 200 basis points of benefit. And in Q4, it would be 250 basis points of benefit. And so, we would have had Continuum, we acquired on March 15th of Q1 of last year and Think was November of 2018.
Maggie Nolan: Very helpful. Thanks. And then, you've talked about more complex larger scale engagements. Obviously, that's going to get you into competition with some larger and more experienced firms as you engage these new types of opportunities. Can you just kind of comment on the competitive environments? Do you expect to see any increasing competitively bid deals or any changes in terms of your ability to bring on higher pricing or drive higher pricing on new engagements?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yeah. We, clearly, compete with top firm for some time already and proportion of these deals for us is increasing year by year. And some of them, we've been able to price differently, but I don't think it's impacting the total picture yet. We hope that it would be changing in the future. But as in the past, it's very – my answer is the same. It's very difficult to predict how it would be happening. And again, directionally, there is a chance that we will benefit from this.
Maggie Nolan: Okay. So, you're talking about change in method of pricing or are you talking about the…?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It's actually rates in general because complex projects also require different composition of the teams, including teams with consultant skills and in-market skills, which also changes the pricing. And on top of this, the method of pricing, because when we go into automation projects, there are some opportunities to do it differently. But, again, it's relatively a small portion of the revenue, and I think impact might be seen like later in the game.
Maggie Nolan: Understand. Thank you.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
David Grossman: Thank you. Well, good morning. I am wondering, Jason, could you just help us out and maybe deconstruct the revenue guide? I think you said a point from acquisitions in 2019. We're still simmering kind of mid-teens-ish headcount with the balance from pricing and a little from utilization. But I think you had mentioned utilization coming down. So, maybe you could just help us out to deconstruct the top line growth?
Jason Peterson: Yeah. So, from a reported standpoint, we've got at least 22% guide. We've got a constant currency at 23%. We've got the minus 1% and that's with Think and Continuum only, if we were to do additional acquisitions. So, that would be additive. And so, if you net out the Think and Continuum at 1%, then you end up with a reported growth rate of 21% and a constant currency growth rate of 22%. I think you'll see the same types of patterns that we've seen in the past, David. And I think you are aware of the fact that we've seen a gradual shift towards onsite capabilities. Those onsite capabilities come on with higher revenues. Also, what we'll see is a certain amount of wage inflation, but we're not seeing any significant changes relative to what we've seen in past years. And we also are, as Ark just indicated, able to get price increases with customers. And the environment seemed somewhat more friendly to that just based on sort of the supply constraints in the market. So, I think you'll see fairly consistent patterns to what maybe you saw in 2018. And I suspect that the – the gross margin will now be as high as it was in Q4 where we exceeded 80%, or that's not what we're expecting. But I think that you'll find that gross margin levels will be in or around what we did for the full year of 2018 [indiscernible].
David Grossman: Okay, got it. And then, in terms of just thinking more broadly about the business model, I know you guys have talked in the past about broadening the pyramid, particularly given what's going on with supply. Any updates there in terms of your efforts to kind of create a broader platform at the bottom of the pyramid and perhaps enhance the available supply that you can use?
Arkadiy Dobkin: David, you know for a long time that we're mentioning how much we invest in education and platforms to manage people. We mentioned this today as well. So, I think that's our constant focus and constant investment. And that's why we have good level of confidence that we would be able to stop. You're absolutely right, it's very, very, very challenging and very tough in all markets.
Jason Peterson: David, our 2019 plan would include slightly elevated level of kind of new grads as we kind of focus on the pyramid in certain geographies in which we operate.
David Grossman: And so, was that at this point, Jason...? Yeah. Go ahead, Ark. I'm sorry.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I just wanted to mention that we also – you know we entered into new markets for talent like India several years ago. And I think we're in much better shape there as well than we were several years ago. So, there are multiple sources now. It's not just Eastern Europe.
David Grossman: Okay, got it. Just one last question. Jason, you mentioned SG&A. There was a one-time benefit in the quarter. Could you just give us a sense of just how large that was?
Jason Peterson: It was approximately – approaching kind of $1 million. So, yeah, it was somewhat substantial in the quarter. But, again, approaching that level.
David Grossman: Got it. All right. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Darrin Peller: Thanks, guys. I just want to follow-up on – when I think about the run rate of revenues from fourth quarter, I know you touched on this, but you're guiding on it because you see something in like Financials or in any other vertical? And just [indiscernible] how sustainable is that kind of [indiscernible]. You're breaking up a little bit, Darrin.
Jason Peterson: You broke up a little bit. So, you're asking about the guide for the quarter or the full year and then it sounds like you specifically asked about healthcare?
Darrin Peller: Yeah. So, can you hear me now? I was just basically trying to figure out if the healthcare and the financials vertical, how you're thinking about the two of them? Healthcare being very strong at 70% and financials being more of a question given the European side?
Jason Peterson: From a healthcare standpoint, we're seeing extremely strong trajectory as we exit Q4, and also seeing extremely strong demand as we enter Q1. So, I expect that that's going to continue to be a very high-growth area for us. From a financial services standpoint, little bit as we talked about. A couple of customers in the European space, which have not been generating growth for us, but we actually are seeing good traction across a number of customers. We've got some payments customers that we're beginning to do some work for. We're also beginning to get some entry into the insurance space, which has been a very kind of underpenetrated kind of part of the financial services area for us. And then, I just think we've got a broad range of, what I'll call, kind of growth engines. And you look at what we've done from an industry vertical standpoint. A year ago, I think that healthcare was actually the slowest-growing vertical we had. And here we are, in this quarter, with it being the highest growing vertical. So, we've got a broad range of growth opportunities across a range of different industry verticals.
Darrin Peller: Okay. Is there anything happening within the financial institutions, the two or three or four that you talked about that we should be keeping an eye on, that could get worse or, potentially – are you embedding the conservatism around those into your guidance, which is partly why you have a deceleration from the fourth quarter run rate?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I wouldn't say that there is anything which we need to worry about from what we mentioned. And I think we are – and I think you might be thinking about our revenues traction not only in terms of verticals, but what type of work we're doing. And that's why, like, volatility between verticals is pretty significant from quarter to quarter, while the growth across the company pretty stable because, like, again, this transformational type of programs digitally led, if you will, they kind of simulate across the verticals as well. And because of the size of the company, when you compare us to the really big guys, we still have higher – much higher volatility across the industries, while general business and the type of business is sometimes similar in these specific portfolios.
Darrin Peller: Okay, right. Just the last question is, I understand that you guys have seasonality on the margin side, but, I guess, having the margins flattish basically after what we saw year-over-year increase and even – Jason, you talked about last quarter – improved contract profitability. Do you still see that improvement continuing through the year despite the puts and takes on a quarterly basis? And then, were you reinvesting the upside?
Darrin Peller: Yeah. So, from a contract standpoint, there is a strong focus within the company on account level profitability. There's some opportunity for price increases and maybe a little bit more so this year than in past years. But at the same time, we've got cost increases in wages and we are making investments in certain areas that probably, if I were to specifically talk about investments in account management, which we think is supportive of future revenue growth, but also allows us to sort of manage some of these more complex programs that Arkadiy was referring to. Another example, in 2018, of investments would be in capabilities and you think about the Google cloud capability that we've talked about. And so, it's a combination of investments in the infrastructure that's required to continue to support a business growing at this rate. And then, investment in capabilities that allow us to address sort of different markets or different segments of markets and grow with our customers.
Darrin Peller: Okay. All right. That's helpful.
Jason Peterson: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arvind Ramnani of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Arvind Ramnani: Hi. Thanks for taking my call. I just kind of wanted to get your sense of the overall sort of demand environment. You certainly sound fairly positive. But can I cast it in comparison to how you felt about the demand environment last year? Have things incrementally improved and what have been the sort of underlying drivers?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Arvind, sorry for boring answer, but again it's very similar. Because the whole company focused on more fast-growing component of the market in comparison to, again, our larger competitors, we've seen relatively strong consistency this year versus last year versus year before. So, there is no much difference in the segment which we play. The demand is pretty good right now still.
Jason Peterson: Yeah. So, a little bit of color, since we talked about, we've got good growth in life sciences and healthcare. In North American hi-tech, particularly in the Bay Area, we're seeing nice growth and we're being brought into a number of large tech customers there. Financial services, again we've talked a little bit about a couple of those smaller customers in Europe, but we've got good growth opportunities in financial services, including insurance that we talked about. And then, we're also seeing a lot of good growth opportunities in North America in the energy space. So, again, we feel that the demand environment looks really good in Q1. A little less visibility, obviously, if you look through the end of the year, but, as Ark said, the visibility is consistent with probably what we've seen in the past.
Arvind Ramnani: Great. And on the last earnings call, you all had talked about automation and some of the work that you are doing with WorkFusion. Can you just give us a little bit more color? And also, are you expanding the kind of vendors you're working with and kind of has some of that work accelerated? Any color on the automation side would be great.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yeah. We do expand in the number of vendors and this work is growing for us. It's all right. And this is pretty good interesting examples where we're able to green light the call [indiscernible] consulting engagements back to actual realization of the benefits.
Arvind Ramnani: Great. Sounds good. Good luck for remainder of the year.
Jason Peterson: Hey, thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Moshe Katri: Hey, thanks. Good morning. A great quarter. In the past, we spoke a bit about wage inflation. And I think you mentioned it today as well. Can we talk about some of those pockets, where are we seeing those pressures? That's number one. And then, I've also noticed besides the fact that Life Sciences was very strong during the quarter, emerging verticals were also very strong. Maybe you can talk about some of those emerging verticals, where are we seeing that strength? And are we getting to a point where some of those emerging verticals will be reported on a separate basis? Thank you.
Jason Peterson: Yeah. Regarding emerging verticals, I think we've talked about automotive in the past. As I just talked about with the last question, the energy has been quite strong for us and we've got some more, I guess, telco-related business. And so, those would kind of be the three to kind of, I think, I'd point out. I don't think we are at a point yet where we would sort of separate any of those, but they continue to be very interesting opportunities and high-growth areas for us.
Moshe Katri: Okay. And then wage inflation, different pockets?
Jason Peterson: Yeah, wage inflation would be pretty consistent with what we saw over the last couple of years. And it's – we've talked about a number kind of approaching 5%. Certainly, there may be some geographies where it's somewhat higher, including maybe the Bay Area, but we haven't seen elevated wage inflation at this time.
Moshe Katri: Okay. And then, just final point. You mentioned very favorable environment for pricing. Should we assume what we've assumed in the past, which is kind of low single-digit growth in pricing for the year? Is that a good number to use for modeling?
Jason Peterson: Yeah. And so, I think I would sort of just make sure. I think I said, as somewhat more favorable environment for pricing. Yeah. And so, I think it would probably be somewhat consistent with what we've seen in the past with maybe a little bit of opportunity.
Moshe Katri: Great, thanks.
Jason Peterson: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Kyle Peterson: Hey, good morning. This is actually Kyle Peterson on for Mayank today. I just want to see, if you comment a little bit – I know you mentioned the kind of war on talent remains pretty strong. Is that having any impact on attrition? Or is that kind of just bouncing along historical averages?
Jason Peterson: Yeah. If I just look at the numbers, it would be just slightly elevated over what we've seen in the past. I could be fair, we're about to payout a variable compensation element. And I think, for any company, you sort of see things change sometimes after that. But, right now, it would just be slightly elevated. Ark, do you have any other thoughts or...?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don't think there's anything else to add. Slightly higher on attritional rate. But, again, this type of volatility, we saw it before as well. It's nothing new.
Kyle Peterson: Great. And then, my only other question would be on the M&A pipeline. Just kind of – if you describe qualitatively kind of what you guys are seeing or what you might be looking for kind of appetite for future deals?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think nothing changing here. We are always looking, always talking. And as soon as something happening, clearly communicating and the strategy there is still the same. It's mostly about client engagement and very specific capabilities. And we building our plans on the same size of acquisitions, while if something bigger and interesting will come. So, we will be considering this too.
Kyle Peterson: All right, great. Thanks, guys.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman of Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question.
Jamie Friedman: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask two questions. I'll just get them both in upfront. When I take your headcount from the end of 2017 relative to the end of 2018, it looks like it grew about 17%, but the revenue was up about 27% constant currency. Jason, I know there's other inputs like utilization and fixed price, but that's a 10% delta between revenue and headcount, which seems like a lot of pricing relative to what you've trained us historically. So, I don't want to get – one, can you verify the math? And two, you're qualifying the pricing increases for 2019, was 2018 just an extraordinary year that way?
Jason Peterson: Yeah. I think the important thing to think about, again, when we talk about pricing, I think we're kind of talking about pricing on a like-for-like basis. And so, for instance, if you've said, resource of a certain level in a certain geography, and so what you're seeing that I think is driving that higher revenue per headcount or whatever language we had used for that is really a generalized kind of drift towards a higher level of in-market resourcing. And so, I think that, if you see early in the fiscal year, we would have been more in the sort of 9% range. And as we exit 2018, I think we're closer to 11% or around that range. And so, obviously, an on-site resource has got a much higher bill rate than an offshore resource, but you don't necessarily – that doesn't translate directly into profitability, right? Because the wages for the onsite are much higher as well. And so, I think what – we're certainly getting some prices I've talked about. But I think a lot of what you see when you do the calculation you're doing is really the shift towards somewhat higher levels of resourcing onsite. And that's relevant for us, as Ark talked about, as we sort of take on more complex engagements with customers. It does help drive larger programs, but it doesn't necessarily drop into a straight improvement in gross margin or adjusted IFO. Does that clarify that?
Jamie Friedman: Yeah. No, that's a great answer. Do you disclose that? I'm looking at the fact sheet. I may be forgetting it, but the onsite/offshore mix?
Jason Peterson: I think we've talked about it publicly. I'm not certain that we actually sort of put in a fact sheet, but it is something that we update on verbally.
Jamie Friedman: Okay. And then, if I could just ask one more, with the top five – no EPAM conversation would be sufficient without the top five question. So, the top five, my calculation, is it grew by 12%, 12.5%, which is about half the corporate average for the quarter. But, interestingly, it looks like it was down sequentially. I know there's some currency mix in there, but my calc is that it's down 2.5% sequentially. You were up 7.8% sequentially. So, anyway, and I know there can be movement in top five that we can see. But, anyways, does that math sound about right? Any commentary there?
Jason Peterson: Yeah. Just one of the top five customers, a piece of their business was split out. And so, now it's an independent entity and you might be able to guess which one that was, okay. A piece of revenue that would have been part of that customer is now not part of that customer, that we're still doing revenue with both customers. But what it did is it reduced the level of revenue associated with one of our top five customers. Is that a clear enough answer?
Jamie Friedman: Yeah. Thank you for that. Thank you, guys.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.
David Straube: Operator? Operator, are you on the line? So, for those that are remaining on the call that we're not able get through the Q&A, we will follow-up with you after this call. But why don't we go ahead – Ark, go ahead and proceed the closing.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. As usual, thank you, everybody, for being with us. So, I think it was – 2018 was a very good year for us. And we hope to continue growing. Talk to you in the next quarter. And happy Valentine's Day for everyone.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the EPAM Systems Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Straube, Head of Investor Relations for EPAM. Thank you, Mr. Straube, you may begin.
David Straube: Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2018 results. If you have not, a copy is available at epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. Before I begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP and are available in our Q3 earnings material located in the Investor section of our website. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Let me begin with a few financial highlights from Q3. We delivered a strong third quarter with revenue of $468 million, reflecting 24% year-over-year growth or 25.4% in constant currency terms. Our revenue growth was broad-based both geographically and across all of our industry verticals. In addition, we delivered strong non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.17, which represents 27% growth from Q3 of 2017. Our results for the first three quarters of fiscal 2018 point to a very consistent story of our ability to execute and grow in the market that demands high-end expertise and ever-changing cutting-edge capabilities spread across multi-functional teams and geographical locations. With the story of consistencies as a backdrop, I would like to step back from the quarter and share a bit broader prospective. We are now approaching EPAM 25th anniversary in December and we started to orchestrate a number of events across the company. Just last month, we hosted our 11th Annual Software Engineering Conference, we brought together all community support practitioners to connect loan and exchange ideas about technology trends and define the market we're currently in. This year event was attended by over 3,000 employees as well as the guests from our clients and from professional communities. They visited from over 20 countries. From one side, our message during this conference was kind of a familiar one to practically everyone today. The world continues to be disrupted in a pace and scale that is forcing massive change across all industries and for the clients we serve. And in results the environment continues to be even more demanding and challenging. Outdated inflexible IT systems that cannot compete against upstarts operating on natively digital platforms a need for completely new enterprise architecture, simple customer centric and configurable, but they often lack the right capabilities to do so and in many cases the current partners they are relying on don't have the capabilities to comprehend such new architectures either. And most importantly, the speed of the changes occurring is a real danger because most often before client can replace a system or build new ones at their regular pace the time will be gone; it's a killer, if you don't have the speed. And demand for capability is an experience become even more challenging because this next wave of digitization the digital ecosystem where everything is coming together: people, suppliers, consumers, and businesses into scalable and flexible platform environment brings a completely different level of sophistication and designing and building and delivering perfect systems. So from another side the question which we really try to address was and still is how to better prepared for those challenges? How to disrupt ourselves further? To be able to solve this question for us and for the client. We do believe we have unique advantage by benefiting from our core software engineering and product development expertise accumulated over last 25 years in collaboration with Strobel technology and software companies. By being their trusted partners, both to build software and to deliver the most complex solution around it. That allow us to navigate over the last years a much more intrinsic journey through digital augmentation and digital services ways and arriving naturally into the world of much more advanced digital ecosystem enterprise level challenge. Still even with a slight advantage the realities of speed, agility, and the right capabilities at the right place and time force upon to disrupt ourselves further by continuously investigating how to turn the company into truly digital ecosystem itself. It simply means that to support needed speed and agility, we need to encourage on our own advanced and native digital platforms and be able to result to orchestrate on demand capabilities across business technology and experience consultancy in a way of thinking internal and external right in time of educational and training services and also help in the majority of our clients do the same. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to help them solving their critical business challenges. And with all of that, we also have to continue to support and expand the key for us, our engineering advantage even further. So that is a set of challenges which we're trying to address during the last few years. We are sure that is a set of challenges we will have to address in the future too. All that means we need to understand what are the right investments we have to make to continuously challenging and disrupting ourselves to find the right answer fast, or sometimes in advance. So far we do believe that this push is bringing new types of opportunities to EPAM where we're getting into very different competition with much larger and if you will much more experience for us. But by demonstrating a different level of speed and agility and engineering quality, we started to see the engagements now which include implementation, roadmaps. These all aspects have changed from organizational strategy to digital operating models to future platform architecture, design and build of such platforms and even new ways of running those. In fact same started to happen practically across all industry sectors we are playing in. In addition, we continue our efforts in open source contributions where we are one of the industry leaders. Continue to focus on our top tier partnerships for example this has now over 2,000 certified architects and engineers to our various cloud competency centers, with over 500 certification for Google Cloud platform, which probably makes us number one in such category. Continued to launch platform accelerators and productivity tools as well as establishing new engineering labs and correspondent initiative to bring financial, speed, agility to ourselves and our clients. With that, I think it's almost the right time to come back to our consistency story and to pass it to Jason to reiterate it with much more specific data than I did in the beginning. begin. But still before that I would like to provide a bit more details on this morning's news which very much relate to the same topic I mentioned in my earlier comments. You might have seen it already. We announced the acquisition of TH_NK Digital; a UK based consultancy with three studios across UK. TH_NK brings a high level of consultants and customer engagement experience -- expertise that expands upon Global Digital and the organizational consultant capabilities within UK and Europe. This acquisition should further enhance our ability to meet customer demand for dynamic design-led consulting, digital products innovation, and advanced business solutions, helping us to build platform speed of scale. So we are the story that continues to evolve. With that said, let me turn finally the call over to Jason for an overview of our Q3 results and business outlook update.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark. Good morning everyone. I will start with some financial highlights and then talk about profitability, cash flow, and then on guidance for fiscal 2018 in Q4. In the third quarter, we delivered very strong top-line performance, exceeded our profitability expectations, and improved earnings per share. Here are a few key highlights from the quarter. Revenue came in at $468.2 million, a year-over-year growth of 24% and 25.4% growth in constant currency. In the quarter revenue reflected a negative foreign exchange impact of 1.4% greater than the 1% impact we expected when we set our Q3 guidance in August. Reported revenue would have been approximately $2.1 million higher this quarter applying the same foreign exchange rates to non-USD revenues used for our Q3 guidance. Looking at revenue growth across our industry verticals in the third quarter, the drivers of growth remain very consistent in the industries we serve, include digital transformation, and increased focus on customer engagement, product development, and driving efficiencies and deeper insights to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and analytics. In Financial Services, our largest vertical we delivered 18.1% growth year-over-year. Growth in Q3 was impacted by an expected ramp-down of activity at a few clients outside of our top five, predominantly based in Europe. Travel and consumer grew 21.9%, software and hi-tech grew approximately 20.1%, Business Information & Media posted 27.2% growth, life sciences and healthcare grew 40.3% reflecting growth in existing clients and quite strong growth in new client revenue. And lastly, our emerging verticals delivered 31.4% growth driven primarily by clients in industrial engineering and energy. From a geographic perspective, North America our largest region representing 60.7% of our Q2 revenues grew 30.3% year-over-year or 30.7% in constant currency. Europe representing 32.5% of our Q3 revenues grew 12.4% year-over-year or 14% in constant currency. CIS representing 4% of our Q3 revenues grew 15.9% year-over-year or 27.8% in constant currency. And finally, APAC grew 67.6% or 71% in constant currency and now represents 2.8% of our revenues. We continue to deliver growth across a broad range of industries, geographies, and engagement types, while driving further diversification in our client concentration. In the third quarter, growth in our top 20 clients was approximately 23%, and growth outside our top 20 clients was approximately 25% compared to the same quarter last year. Moving down to income statement, our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35.7% compared to 36.6% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 37.3% compared to 37.9% for the same quarter last year. The decline in gross margin was primarily driven by higher level of accrued variable compensation compared to the same quarter last year. GAAP SG&A was 19.8% of revenue compared to 21.5% in Q3 of last year. And non-GAAP SG&A came in at 18% of revenue compared to 19.8% in the same period last year. And at the bottom of the 18% to 19% range, we used to manage the business. GAAP income from operations was $64.6 million or 13.8% of revenues in the quarter compared to $49.2 million or 13% of revenue in Q3 last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $82.1 million or 17.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to $62.6 million or 16.6% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 0.6% which includes the impact of a $7.1 million favorable adjustment to the original charge for the one-time transition tax under U.S. Tax Reform originally booked in Q4 2017, as well as a $6.1 million excess tax benefit related to stock option exercises investing of restricted stock units. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate which excludes these and other adjustments was approximately 20%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.15 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.17 reflecting a 49.4% and 27.2% increase over the same quarter in fiscal 2017. In Q3 there were approximately 57 million diluted shares outstanding. We ended the quarter with over 25,200 delivery professionals, a 16.6% increase year-over-year and a net addition of more than 900 production professionals during Q3. Our total headcount ended at more than 28,400 employees. Utilization was 76.4% compared to 77.6% in the same quarter last year and 78% in Q2. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operations for Q3 was up $102.3 million compared to $62.2 million in the same quarter last year and free cash flow was $94.1 million compared to $56.8 million in the same quarter last year. DSO was 81 days compared to 83 days at the end of Q2 fiscal 2018 and 82 days in the same quarter last year. We continue to focus on managing our total DSO performance in the low 80s. Now let's turn to guidance. Our updated full-year and Q4 outlook reflect both an acceleration in revenue growth expected for the quarter relative to that achieved in Q3, as well as a modest contribution from the acquisition we announced earlier today. So starting with fiscal 2018, revenue growth is now expected to be at least 26.5% reported despite the strength of the U.S. dollar reducing the full-year benefit of foreign exchange from 1% to 0.5%. Revenue growth on a constant currency basis will now be at least 26%. As a reminder, our full-year revenue outlook continues to reflect an approximate 2% contribution from inorganic revenues. We expect GAAP income from operations to now be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to now be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to now be approximately 2% which reflects our tax planning efforts in response to the U.S. tax reform legislation. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to continue to be approximately 22%. For earnings per share, we now expect GAAP diluted EPS to be at least $4.22 for the full-year and non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be at least $4.32 for the full-year. We continue to expect weighted average share count of 56.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For Q4 of fiscal year 2018, revenues will be at least $500 million for the fourth quarter including an estimated $2 million contribution from the TH_NK acquisition producing a growth rate of at least 25% reported and at least 26% in constant currency after factoring at a 1% estimated unfavorable foreign exchange impact. For the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 14% to 15% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 17% to 18%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 19% and non-GAAP effective tax rate will be approximately 22%. Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $1.03 for the quarter and non-GAAP EPS will be at least $1.22 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 57.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And finally, a few key assumptions which support our Q4 GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock compensation expense is now expected to be approximately $13 million. Amortization of intangibles is now expected to be approximately $2.7 million. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately $0.5 million loss. The tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is now expected to be around $3.2 million. Lastly, we expect excess tax benefits to now be around $2.3 million. In summary, we are pleased with the third quarter results which reflect strong broad-based growth across all our verticals and geographies. Our unique positioning in the market combined with our solid fundamentals positions us well for continued growth in fiscal 2018. With that, let's open up the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Thank you, hi Ark, hi Jason. Good morning. My question is with regards to the acceleration in revenues that you're seeing, if you could maybe break that down into sort of signing new clients versus your contract sizes increasing as software engineering and digital transformation just becomes more and more mainstream. I guess let me start if you could provide a little bit of color as to what's driving that acceleration and the sustainability of it?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Hi. So first of all the acceleration exist, but it's not so huge, it's probably in line with what we were showing before but the type of work is slowly that's kind of starting to change we see this more platform demand opportunities. And we do believe we have some advantage there but it is very complex and there is a lot of demand there but kind of delivering is still challenge for us as well and that's why I was trying to explain and focusing on a lot of potential challenges we see ahead of this. And this is also like I was trying to highlight, it's on our capabilities, but it's also material decline from one point of view clients needed from another point of view clients not necessarily always ready for this. But again in short, we see the change in the kind of portfolio where more than once come in from more integrated platform lead solution. I don't know if I can bring more color to this, might just happen.
Jason Peterson: Yes, I guess the only sort of subtle adder would be that we are seeing somewhat of an acceleration in new customer revenues. So we have a significant demand from new customers. They obviously start small and then grow over time and that that is contributing to the somewhat higher level demand that we're seeing in Q4.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Got it. And then just to pick out a couple of the areas the verticals obviously good, it looks like good sequential acceleration in life sciences and the emerging verticals are also doing well. Could you kind of talk about sort of first of all what's contained in the emerging verticals and just talk about just frankly then back to the comments on platform, life sciences and healthcare. Maybe something about the nature of the work you're doing, is it -- the reason you're seeing the pickup there?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. It's a lot of questions a lot.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: So a, b, c and b side?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So what we qualify under others is everything we should not blow into the -- our key line of business right now but you’re right it’s growing fast and it includes for example oil gas, energy, engineering, and even telco as well.
Jason Peterson: In automotives.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So basically in automotives right, so and it is high growth and this is many of them new clients for us and good portion of this coming with this platform lead opportunities where we need like to put the best of us to be able to deliver, okay. So specifically on life science, for example, or some other verticals, like this quarter life science and healthcare are showing much better results than before and again this is relatively so only 10%, 11% of our business, so volatility here is happening and will be happening because again one, two clients start or finish might impact specific quarterly results. This quarter looks very good, so what we do is in life science and what is operating in R&D space and data space which specialization and focus on some programs around genomic data for example where automations are lot good. So but we grow in commercial part as well, so what does equation for that?
Ashwin Shirvaikar: No. I think I just basically looking for those sorts of examples on life sciences trying to connect it to your platform comment but I think I do get that. Thank you, congratulations on this quarter.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Avishai Kantor with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Avishai Kantor: Hi, good morning everyone. My first question is around pricing, is the growing consulting what seems to be the growing effort and focus around consulting, does that enable you to have a positive impact on the overall pricing plan?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, I think in longer-term we will expect more impact. But at this point consulting for us has enabled for total solutions and for us there is and we shared this in the past as well, there is no goal to bring consulting as a just separate service risk, higher margins, the goal how to help to do end-to-end solutions and help clients in our sales actually to explain ROI in advance and then focus on the things which are necessary. I think it would take some time before maturity of this whole operation would grow and we will see much big impact on our margins. There are probably some but it's very difficult to measure specifically because of we not treating consulting just as a line of business. So it's difficult to understand exactly from where the benefits or problem would begin.
Avishai Kantor: And the next question regarding finding the right talent, are you looking for new regions or new countries in order to find the required talent?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we always looking for new regions, for new talents because all of us practically each time we repeat, it’s one of the key challenges for everybody in global market and we open in offices, additional offices in Europe, we’re thinking about some additional investments in locations where we have started to improve the quality of talent we can bring, how to train it, and how to bring the level which we need. But yes simple answer we look all the time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Darrin Peller: All right, hey guys, good morning, thanks. Maybe to start off with a financial question, your margin did come in better than we thought and your rising EPS guidance nicely now. Maybe you could just give us some building blocks on what the key drivers of that versus your prior expectations going into the beginning of the year and maybe even into the quarter?
Jason Peterson: Yes, we have to run at somewhat higher utilization than we had expected, we are expected to see the higher utilization again in Q4. We're also seeing a stable wage environment, probably getting a little bit of benefit from customer mix and then throughout the year, we've had a focus on account profitability and I’d like to think that that is producing benefit. Finally, we're also seeing benefits from our focus on managing SG&A. At the same time where we continue to invest to make sure we can deliver greater than 20% both in the upcoming fiscal years.
Darrin Peller: Great, thanks. I mean that sounds like some of these variables are sustainable in terms of utilization, wage, did you tell me I mean not the word in your mouth, would you say that wage inflation in your view is looking like it's pretty stable at this point or like for the next few quarters more than just your thought?
Jason Peterson: Yes, it’s always hard to predict what will happen with wage inflation and so what I can say is that wage inflation let’s say this year has been very much within our expectations and it’s been relatively stable and not elevated over the levels we've seen in the past. But it would be hard for me to predict the future.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And I would agree that it's difficult to predict how it's going to work out because it’s clearly a function of talent ability and you all know and confirm that it’s a global challenge and we will see how next quarter should work so difficult to predict.
Jason Peterson: But as always but over the years but certainly I think with a little bit more focus we are quite focused on account level profitability and doing what we can do to maintain and improve profitability despite what happens with the wage inflation.
Darrin Peller: That’s good to see that commentary. Just a quick follow-up on the financial verticals, looks again I mean revenue growth is strong, one vertical looks like it deceled a little bit and I’m just curious if it’s something around by maybe one of your larger clients I think it's showing that's sort of running at a theme or anything else going on there? Thanks guys.
Jason Peterson: So and I think that’s just a couple of things. If we brought -- if we included foreign exchange which was a negative the growth in that financial services would have been just over 20%. We did see a few financial services customers not in our top five that -- that's all declines. So there were few customer specific events, we still see very strong demand in financial services and expect to see very strong demand in Q4, we did see a few of our smaller clients with the decline.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Kupferberg: Good morning guys, thanks. I just wanted to add on with the margin question, so obviously you took the guide up there 50 basis points at the mid-point to your 17% now for the year, I mean how much headroom is there over time in the margins, I mean is there still room to drive additional SG&A efficiency over time as you think about business over the next couple of years because it sounds like this is a little bit of a new normal to the expenses the recent range was kind of pegged between 16% and 17% and now we're trending higher than that?
Jason Peterson: Yes, I think I’d say that we’re still working on our 2019 plans, so it would be hard for us to comment at this time. We're going to continue to make investments to make sure we’re continuing to grow the company in excess of 20% per year. I think that the one comment I would make just kind of based on history is that the first half of the year you saw in the low end of the 16% to 17% range clearly in Q3 and in Q4 we're talking about being above the 17% range. So I think what I would say is you can clearly see that we can operate anywhere in that 16% to 17% range at the high-end of the range as well as the low-end of the range. But this time we wouldn’t be able to sort of provide any additional color on what we expect for adjusted IFO in 2019.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. What can you tell us just in terms of attrition trends in the quarter, I know you don't disclose an exact number but I think last quarter the comment was that it had grown up quarter-over-quarter, so what was the direction there in Q3?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So attrition still is the same kind of level like maybe significantly higher than the last quarter but it's mid-teens right now. So and again it's all combination of balance and wage, so you know.
Jason Kupferberg: Yes, digital count is still tight?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It's not -- it's not decreasing let's say that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Mayank Tandon: Thank you. Good morning. Jason as you look ahead into next year and maybe for Ark as well just wanted to get your thoughts on how you think about growth from the standpoint of headcount additions versus pricing leverage and any further improvement in utilization. And then I have a follow-up around just over time, do you expect the model to shift more to fixed price maybe even outcome based or transaction based pricing versus currently being much more heavily weighted towards timing materials? Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. I think on utilization, we probably at the level which we’re not going to make it higher. I think it's around optimal and we would be probably if we're able to maintain at this level. Specifically, telling that we continue to grow pretty fast. So, on the model we definitely research and brainstorming what's possible to do here? But like also pointed before and I would like to point to once again the T&M is not just the model which we selected because it's easier to do. T&M is practically subject of type of work which we do in a way to go and build a new staff which dynamically changing from client side and from the client competition side and it's very difficult to turn this type of work to fixed cost or isolates because again fixed cost isolates something which very well define or you do it multiple times, you know how to predict, you know how to cut fast and this is not the type of work which we usually do. So at the same time, outcome with might be an answer for this, if there are right kind of relationship understanding and readiness not only from us but from the clients. And that's why we were talking about all we're working and creating this digital ecosystems to run ourself to be more fast and speedy and we’re trying to starting to work type of consultancy to clients as well because some of them are really like an ability to act accordingly. And I think there are some first signs that might be opportunities for us to earn more. The different models but it's still very early to say but we definitely thinking and experimenting with it right now.
Mayank Tandon: Great. So it sounds like the growth will be largely driven by headcount additions at least in the near to medium term?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So it would be both, we clearly we have multiple initiatives right now, how to separate this two but headcounts still would be the number of quality of engineering stuff still would be very important.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
David Grossman: Thanks. Just a quick financial question to get started. Are you going to disclose the top 5% in top five anymore? I know you gave the top 10 and top 20 or outside the top 20.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, we've got that [indiscernible]. David is it --
Jason Peterson: Yes, David that is in our fact sheet on our website the top five.
David Grossman: Okay. I can look there earlier. Yes and then I think this has come up in a couple of different questions but if you go back starting at the end of last year is when the cost of per head started growing at a faster rate than the revenue per head and I know there is some utilization element to that but is that the state of the world that we're in for the foreseeable future given the labor markets and how much historically I know pricing leverage to some extent has been a function of employee or customer turnover but can you give us a sense of kind of what we should be thinking about over the next 12 months in terms of that equation?
Arkadiy Dobkin: In terms of price increases or in terms of --
David Grossman: Yes, the price wage dynamic historically you were able to drive revenue per head at a faster rate than cost per head in that dynamic split last year?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I'm not sure it's I believe since the last year, so. David it's difficult to answer the question and I'm not exactly understanding.
Jason Peterson: Yes, David again you can imagine this is one of those that defense questions in terms of the answer. But what we’re seeing is the ability to take up the rates, we did see some rate increases across some large customers here in Q3, it is a focus of ours obviously to deliver certain quality and to make certain that we’re getting more return for our clients but at the same time to capture some of the value for our investors and so it is a focus of ours to sort of drive to account profitability. And there is definitely attention to the pricing element and so it’s hard to say whether or not pricing is going to accelerate at a greater rate than wage inflation. But what I can’t say is that we do continue to get rate increases and we clearly look for those opportunities with both existing and new customers.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.
Jamie Friedman: Hi, thank you and congratulations on the 25th anniversary, Ark in your prepared remarks you had outlined increased complexity was already used in the technology landscape, I just want to make sure I understand is that a good or bad thing for EPAM, that's my first question? I will ask my other one, Jason, with regard to the DSO is a good cash flow quarter and good to see that DSOs stable, is there any opportunity to improve on that even further, so first on the complexity and second on the cash the DSO? Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Question number one, good or bad it’s first of all that’s the reality and we do believe for the component of the market we should blame in is given us opportunity to potentially win more deals because we believe better prepared for this type of more complex work. But at the same time more complex work require different combination of capabilities and all of this is creating challenges as well. So we do think it’s good but it’s more challenging as well.
Jason Peterson: From the DSO standpoint, we took down DSO by two days in the quarter, I would not expect to see a further decline, I think we’re comfortable with this low 80s but it is an area of focus of ours and we are looking to continue to evolve that. But at this time, I would say just to consider sort of a low 80s is a corporate target for us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arvind Ramnani with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Arvind Ramnani: Hi Ark, hi Jason. Congrats on another strong quarter.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Arvind Ramnani: I just had a couple of questions on automation in the last earnings call; you had kind of explained what you're doing on automation. Just wanted to see if you have an update and specifically are there particular vendors that you're working with as it relates to RPA?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think nothing significantly changed during the quarter. It’s still very good area and it’s growing area for us but I don’t think there is any specific update over the three months which makes sense to bring it.
Arvind Ramnani: Yes. But are there some particular RPA vendors that you're working with I know Work Solution is one but are there others you’re working with as well?
Arkadiy Dobkin: No, we’re working with same set of vendors. We’re choosing one of the top and we’re working with couple others. Exactly, again its landscape didn’t change in few months.
Arvind Ramnani: Right.
Arkadiy Dobkin: While I understand you’re asking it because it’s a very dynamic market and everything can happen but not so fast.
Arvind Ramnani: Great. And just in terms of like the pricing models on your automation projects, is it similar to kind of the other projects you do or are the pricing models slightly different?
Arkadiy Dobkin: This is very new and clearly automation much most of you go for outcome based because it’s much easier to measure the impact and there are multiple discussions in our current deals how we’re going to do it. So that’s a very right question, that’s probably the area where we might be going out of T&M in the future much faster.
Arvind Ramnani: Great. And this last question on this topic, are there particular set of clients either by geography or by industry there you’re seeing higher interest or is this kind of an area that has demand across all of your client base?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So definitely I think insurance and financial services probably champion is right now because there are a lot of fewer type of services there but it’s also related to retail as well.
Arvind Ramnani: Terrific, thank you. Good luck for the remainder of the year.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Georgios Kertsos with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question.
Georgios Kertsos: Yes, hi guys, thanks for taking the question. I guess a quick high level question from me, are you seeing increasing demand from your clients for near and onshore delivery, I expecting you’re updating gradually and steadily away from offshore?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think we’re seeing demand for more cross-functional teams and with some of them to be staffed in the market. So because of complexity of the problems not because specifically wanted people here but to deliver this complexity we need more subject expertise, more vast knowledge, more consultant skills, and very often this type of skills should be deployed in the market. So this is happening and this is a brand we’re seeing but we don’t see the brand like no global delivery and no offshore and this is still the play between all capabilities cost and scalability clearly. There are dramatical change but it would be some type of evolution to and again in our case specifically we’ve have given still only what 10%, 11% of the people in the market which is probably at least wise way than most of our competitors.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vladimir Bespalov with VTB Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Vladimir Bespalov: Hello, congratulations on very strong number and thank you for taking my question. My first question is on the appliance concentration, I see that in the second file in your top 20 there is a big increase of the share of those clients maybe you could provide some color what was this driven by acquisition of new clients or ramping up of the existing clients and my second question is on capital allocation, I ask this question from time to time but I see cash file keeps increasing, so any new developments in this area how to allocate this cash, how to use it and could you maybe provide how much of this is in Belarus and outside Belarus? Thank you.
Jason Peterson: So from a concentration standpoint and it’s a good point because I saw the same thing which is the 11 to 20, the 11th largest to the 20th largest customers had a very at the high growth rate in the quarter and a number of those customers are customers that may not be new customers the customers that we’ve acquired within the last two years. And what I think it does speak to is just a fact that we are still in a position with our customers and even our larger customers where many of them have significant wallet share opportunities for us. There are large global companies, we get in, we do work, we are successful with the program and then they ask us to help out in another areas. And so what we do find there is continues to be significant growth opportunities even within these large customers and again you add a couple of very nice kind of growing accounts in that 11 to 20 range. From a cash flow -- from a cash standpoint, you're right and we're using more cash this quarter than last, about and we have taken the opportunity post U.S. tax reform to bring some of that cash back to the United States, right now over 40% of that cash is in the U.S. so we have taken down the balance that we have in Belarus. And from a capital allocation standpoint still very focused on acquisitions, I think you might see in the first half of 2019 is see us doing deals that are somewhat accelerated rate. So couple of deals in that time period rather than one I think you might see us do somewhat larger deals and so rather than deals that are $30 million or $50 million deals that would be somewhat larger than that. And so that’s what we’re going to continue to sort of focus these cash. However we do meet with our board and discuss the evolution of our capital allocation strategy and we do think about all the obvious sort of share purchased that sort of reduced dilution in some of that. But we’re not at a point in time where we would be discussing that and certainly not with any sort of communication.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.
Joseph Foresi: Hi. I was wondering if you could give more color on what type of projects and clients had issues within financial services.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Financial services clearly is very diverse segment and I think we were telling the story of what we do on more traditional investment banking side and we also shared some successes and we continue doing this on the wealth management side and more digital type of projects. So working in financial services also incorporates for us number of clients which is more in data side for financial services. In fact smaller companies which are build in new type of banking systems and payment systems that's another segment which we’re seeing and most of this like when I’m saying banking, I’m more referring to retail banking, one line retail banking and everything around payments which is pretty interesting and growing area for us. And there are also number of services we provide for hedge funds as well. So again it’s very diverse portfolio with very different type of projects and from geography point of view as well, it’s pretty much spread across Europe and North America and Asia.
Jason Peterson: So that is where we’re really seeing the growth with the wealth management, asset management, FinTech, also seeing nice growth in the insurance area still relatively small for us. But growing with a lot in these customer revenues and so I guess maybe you could conclude from that that I get the inverse in terms of answering your question.
Joseph Foresi: Okay. That’s what I thought, okay and then just on the platforms, move to platforms. Did those come in at higher margins, are there build ones and kind of resell opportunity and how should we think about that as it becomes a bigger piece of your business, does it extend your comp set how do we think about that and its impact on margins? Thanks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: We kind of answering this already and there is no black and white answer here because from one point of view this platform build-up is a very complicated effort, starting from consultancy and going to architecture and going to silicon the right component and then put it together and what I’m trying to say that it's still in majority T&M type of job and you need like in some categories you need much more higher caliber people for this but at the same time, this high caliber people is also more expensive. So until we will see enough experience doing this and able to bring more our accelerators and some components and we're focusing on this too, it would be difficult to kind of predict what is the margin impact, it is going to be. But at the same time, it’s definitely giving us opportunity to grow fast and to support the investments which we need to do.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. Thank you, thank you everyone. So it was a good quarter, we hope to deliver a good year in three months and share this with you and also just to share that in December we’re going to celebrate our 25th year anniversary. So it’s kind of a special year for us. And I would like to thank all of our employees and clients for giving us opportunity and for investors clearly, too. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to EPAM Systems Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, David Straube, Head of Investor Relations.
David Straube: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company’s second quarter 2018 results. If you have not, a copy is available at epam.com in the Investors section. With me today are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that some of the comments made on today’s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company’s earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP and are available in our Q2 earnings materials located in the Investor section of our website. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Let me begin with a few financial highlights. We delivered a strong second quarter with revenues of $445.6 million, reflecting 27.7% year-over-year growth or 27.1% in constant currency terms. Our revenue growth was broad-based, both geographically and across all of our industry verticals. In addition, we delivered strong non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.01, which represents 26% growth from Q2 of 2017. Let me provide you with a brief update across the key dimensions of our business. Looking at our capabilities and offerings. Last quarter, we talked about enriching our offerings across digital transformation programs and connected digital platforms, which continues to be our key areas of focus with accelerated development of capabilities in intelligent automation, RPA, machine learning and IoT. Additionally, we also talked about expanding our horizons with new offerings around physical product innovation with close connectivity into software-controlled ecosystems as well as strengthening our design thinking and business consultancy skills. Finally, we talked about our aspiration to integrate, at different levels, EPAM consulting capabilities across business, experience and technology disciplines into our mainstream delivery offerings, and as a result, to significantly elevate the overall value of the solutions we build for our clients. In Q2, we continued to focus on those areas and are starting to see some results triggered by our new cross-functional initiatives in a number of potentially large engagements as well as in numerous wins of new types of deals because of broader adoption of such an approach. A couple relevant highlights to illustrate. While we were involved for sometime in many proof-of-concept-type efforts based on RPA technologies, some of those projects have evolved into much more complex and sizable intelligent automation engagements across several industries. As in the case of any organization, understanding the potential benefits of intelligent automation, realities of implementation in specific corporate environments, maturity and actual functionality of emerging platforms and setting achievable goals within a given time frame is critical and can mean the key difference between reaching the desired outcome or complete failure. This is where we started to bring new value by offering a very practical approach, built in close coordination between our consulting and engineering teams, working together to minimize risks and to better predict results. An example of this is the work we are doing for one of the world’s largest insurance companies. As in many other cases, we started with an engineering engagement where we demonstrated our traditional strengths. However, this time, we were able to bring our consulting capabilities very early on and expand into a comprehensive business assessment of what the client actually needed to accomplish. We demonstrated at that engagement that we could deliver value through entire end-to-end automation effort efficiently in a well-integrated and practical fashion. As a result, we are currently developing similar solutions in several new, much larger areas and helping the client to improve productivity and reduce costs with much higher probability of success. In another case, for one of the largest consumer packaged goods brands, an engagement which we started in the data area to build an analytical solution serving revenue and pricing, supply chain, brand management and customer teams was turned into the initiative where our engineers and data scientists become part of multiple innovation efforts, utilizing machine learning, natural language and image recognition techniques to bring efficiency via automation to a very new level while improving customer experience based on optimal planogram execution. These types of engagements and many in other areas demonstrate the value we can bring and our ability to help our customers achieve their business goals through real integrated and coordinated efforts of multidisciplinary teams of engineers, designers and consultants. So while well-designed and built software is a very critical and major component of the services we deliver, we now bring much more than just that. Moving to our people engagement and capability development. We ended the quarter with over 24,300 delivery professionals, a 19% increase year-over-year and a net addition of more than 600 production professionals during Q2. Our total headcount ended at more than 27,400 employees. As one of the relevant highlights for the quarter, I would like to share that in June, we expanded our operations in Hyderabad with the opening of our new digital engineering center. This state-of-the-art development facility is designed to enable advanced technical training, R&D and full-cycle customer programs ranging from commercial product development to digital platforms and innovative experimentation. The center is a good example of our continued investment in our people and capabilities and our goal of building a strong network of high-quality delivery centers around the globe. As we continue to grow, we are also investing in existing and new locations within the European Union, across Central and Eastern Europe and across other regions of APAC. I would also like to share that as more of what we do for clients is done at or near their locations, this requires us to attract, retain and develop employees in different markets than we used to do before. In some instances, our ability to respond to demand may take longer as we continue to learn and to balance what appears to be a strong year against the investments we need to make to bring the right talent to EPAM. Despite of that, we remain very confident that with the right level of effort in key areas, we will be able to meet the demands. Turning to market and client updates. Rounding out my comments on the second quarter results. We had broad-based growth across our industry verticals in the second quarter. The drivers of growth remain very consistent in the industries we serve, which include, as shared already today, the themes of digital transformation, an increased focus on customer engagement, product development and driving the efficiencies and deeper insights through artificial intelligence, machine learning and analytics. In Financial Services, our largest vertical, we finished the quarter with 30% growth year-over-year. Travel and Consumer grew 30%. Software & Hi-Tech grew approximately 22%. Business information and media posted 23% growth. Life Science & Healthcare grew 33%. And lastly, our emerging verticals delivered 32% growth, driven primarily by clients from industrial engineering, energy and automotive sectors. We continue to diversify across our client portfolio by industry, geography and types of engagements. In the second quarter, growth in our top 20 clients was approximately 23% and growth outside our top 20 clients was approximately 32% compared to the same quarter last year. While we continue to bring new significant logos to our client list, it’s worthwhile to remind that close to 50% of our top 200 clients today are among the Forbes Global 2000 and provide to us a great opportunity to grow significantly within our existing customer portfolio as well. With that, let me turn it over to Jason for detailed financial update.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. I’ll start with some financial highlights and talk about profitability, cash flow and then end on guidance for fiscal 2018 and Q3. In the second quarter, we delivered very strong top line performance, exceeded our profitability expectations and grew earnings per share. Here are a few key highlights from the quarter. Revenue closed at $445.6 million, reflecting a 27.7% year-over-year growth rate or 27.1% growth in constant currency terms. In the quarter, revenue reflected a foreign exchange benefit of less than 1%, lower than the approximately 2% favorable currency impact we expected when we set our Q2 guidance in May. Applying the same foreign exchange rates to non-USD revenues as those used in our Q2 guidance, reported revenue would have been approximately $2 million higher this quarter. From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region, representing 59.3% of our Q2 revenues, grew 28% year-over-year in constant currency. Europe, representing 33.6% of our Q2 revenues, grew 23.6% year-over-year or 21.3% in constant currency. CIS, representing 4.4% of our Q2 revenues, grew 31.4% year-over-year or 42.5% in constant currency. And finally, APAC grew 66.5% in constant currency and now represents 2.7% of our revenues. We move down the income statement, our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35.1% compared to 36.9% in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 36.7% compared to 38.1% for the same quarter last year. The decline in gross margin was driven primarily by the impact of lower utilization and a higher level of accrued variable compensation compared to Q2 of last year. GAAP SG&A was 20.6% of revenue compared to 23% in Q2 of last year, and non-GAAP SG&A came in at 18.8% of revenue compared to 20.4% in the same period last year. We are pleased with the efficiency we have achieved in our SG&A spend, and we’ll continue to manage SG&A closely in both dollar terms and as a percentage of revenues. GAAP income from operations was $54.2 million or 12.2% of revenue in the quarter compared to $40.7 million or 11.7% of revenue in Q2 last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $72.3 million or 16.2% of revenue in the quarter compared to $55.8 million or 16% of revenue in Q2 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter came in at 12%, which includes the impact of a $5.4 million excess tax benefit related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes the excess benefit and other adjustments, was approximately 22%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $0.89 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.01, reflecting a 30.9% and 26.3% increase, respectively, over the same quarter in fiscal 2017. In Q2, there were approximately 56.6 million diluted shares outstanding. Utilization was 78% compared to 79.6% in the same quarter last year and 77.6% in Q1. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q2 was $59.5 million compared to $30.2 million in the same quarter last year. Free cash flow was $50.9 million compared to $24.5 million in the same quarter last year. DSO was flat compared to 83 days at the end of Q1 fiscal 2018 and 82 days in the same quarter last year. We continue to focus on managing our total DSO performance in the low 80s. Turning now to guidance. Starting with fiscal 2018, with the strength of the U.S. dollar, revenue growth is now expected to be at least 26% reported when factoring in an updated foreign exchange impact of positive 1%. Revenue growth on a constant-currency basis continues to be at least 25%. As a reminder, our full year revenue outlook reflects approximately a 2% contribution from inorganic revenues. We expect GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 12% to 13% and non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to now be approximately 5%, which reflects our tax planning efforts in response to the U.S. tax reform legislation. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to continue to be approximately 22%. For our earnings per share, we now expect GAAP diluted EPS to be at least $3.80 for the full year and non-GAAP diluted EPS will continue to be at least $4.11 for the full year. We now expect weighted average share count of 56.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For Q3 of FY ‘18, revenues will be at least $466 million, reflecting a growth rate of approximately 23% reported and approximately 24% in constant currency after factoring in a 1% estimated unfavorable foreign exchange impact. For the third quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 12% to 13% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 17% and non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 22%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $0.85 for the quarter and non-GAAP EPS will be at least $1.04 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 56.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions which support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock compensation expense is now expected to be approximately $15.3 million in Q3 and $15.2 million in Q4. Amortization intangibles is now expected to be approximately $2.2 million in each remaining quarter for the fiscal year. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately $0.5 million loss in each remaining quarter. The tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is now expected to be around $3.8 million in each remaining quarter. Lastly, we expect excess tax benefits to now be around $3 million in Q3 and $3.3 million in Q4. In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter and first half 2018 results, which reflect strong, broad-based growth across our verticals and geographies. Our unique positioning in the market, combined with our solid fundamentals, positions us well for continued growth in fiscal 2018. With that, let’s open the call up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Please proceed.
Maggie Nolan: I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about how you’re pricing some of these intelligent automation solutions, especially the ones that are a little more horizontal in nature? And then should we expect to see changes in your contract-type mix over time as a result of more of these solutions?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So this is still pretty new area for everybody and it’s a mixed pricing between fixed cost and time and material, specifically on engineering part. But at the same time, when we involve each consultant, we’re trying to assess what would be potential return and project that relate to the client. So it’s a – as I said, it’s a mixed approach right now and I think both vendors and clients are winning at this point still. But the hope, actually on headcount, clear headcount cost reduction.
Maggie Nolan: Okay. Great. And then did you say you’re looking to some new markets for labor? And if so, what geographies are you hoping to develop or expand? And then when you do enter new labor markets, what steps are you taking to gain traction there?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we’re not looking of new markets in the kind of big meaning of this work because we do believe that we are already in the markets in our traditional Eastern Europe locations. We are in India. We are in China. But we expand in the regions of these markets and some of these – as you know, markets pretty large and we’ll – we are always open for new locations which we open in inorganic way as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Avishai Kantor with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.
Avishai Kantor: From the consulting practice perspective, are you considering joint ventures or partnerships with extended loan consultants for front-end strategic opportunities? Or you think it’s critical for you to maintain those skills in-house?
Arkadiy Dobkin: On specific project opportunities, we’re clearly open for any type of partnership and – with other firms. At the same time, we do believe that it’s critically important to have these capabilities inside of EPAM because to achieve the level of integration and the benefits of starting to sync for the total solution versus specific consulting or design or engineering parts of this, it is important to build this capability inside of the company.
Avishai Kantor: And then on M&A opportunities going forward, what are your thoughts on adding digital transformation skills versus domain or vertical expertise?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we were adding digital transformation skills during the last five, six years, and we’re still open to add this in an organic way where it’s important in specific locations. And we’re, again, looking for such additions. The same like in other areas, which you mentioned, I think we still have enough gaps to fill through specific M&As, the same like we grow in this very aggressively organic nature.
Operator: Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel. Please proceed.
David Grossman: Just one clarification. I missed the utilization number, Jason. Could you give that to me, again, please?
Jason Peterson: Yes. Utilization number is 78% in the quarter.
David Grossman: Okay. So flat sequentially?
Jason Peterson: A little bit of an improvement from Q1 to Q2, and that’s in part what drove the improvement in the gross margin from Q1 to Q2.
David Grossman: Okay. So just – since you brought up the gross margin, can you – I know you mentioned a couple of items that impacted the margin on a year-over-year basis, and I think it is lower utilization. I think you were close to 80 last year and higher accrued comp. But it was down in the March quarter as well. I’m just curious, these higher utilization rates, I know they’re – maybe you’re down year-over-year, but you’re still at relatively high levels. Is there some other dynamic going on within the gross margin that can maybe driving it down?
Jason Peterson: I think it’s pretty much on the surface, the utilization numbers in the accrued compensation that we talked about. And so Q2 of last year was an extremely high level of utilization at 79.6%, and so there is a pretty significant decline between Q2 of 2017 and Q2 of 2018. And then we’ve got the variable comp piece, which we’ve talked about. We did improve gross margin between Q1 and Q2 of this year. And what we expect to see is that continued improvement in gross margin in the second half of 2018. So I think you’ll continue to see gross margin improvement. And I’m sure, as you’ve noted, profitability from an adjusted IFO standpoint is actually up if you look at the first half of 2018 versus the first half of 2017. And so we feel like we’re still very much able to manage within the 16% to 17%. And I think what you’ll see is improvement in gross margin throughout the remainder of the year.
David Grossman: And what drives the higher gross margin in the back half of the year?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So in Q3, you’ll have sort of 2 effects. One will be that you’ve got a seasonal lower utilization level in Q3 just due to vacations and summertime. And so that’s something that you see every year for us. You do have more bill days though so the net impact to that is still up, the positive improvement in – or an improvement in gross margin. And then what you’ll see us do is continue to work on utilization in Q4. At the same time, I think we’ve talked about the pricing environment in the past is that on average across the broad range of customers, we are seeing average rates increase. And then as we’ve talked about, there’s a significant number of customers where we’re actually getting annual rate increases.
David Grossman: Right. And I think Ark mentioned that there’s an increased demand and requirement of the market to be delivering services locally. Is that pressing the margin at all?
Jason Peterson: Yes. There hasn’t been a significant shift in the onsite/offshore ratio. So it’s just a very modest shift. And so no. At this time, that wouldn’t be any sort of driver. What you’re really seeing is just the delta between the high level of utilization we ran last year and kind of where we are right now. And that was intentional. We talked about taking utilization down to allow us the opportunity to continue to grow rapidly.
David Grossman: Right. And I guess in the past, you’ve given us a number that characterizes how much growth is coming from the existing base versus new clients. Do you happen to have that number?
Jason Peterson: Yes. We’ve got that. And so – and it would – it’s consistent with that 40%, 60% that we’ve talked about with 40% of it coming from, what we call, new revenants, which are customers that began generating revenue in the last 12 months; and 60% from the existing customer base.
Operator: Our next question is from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Please proceed.
Jamie Friedman: Hi, good morning, good quarter here. I just wanted to follow up with David’s. Not to test your patience here, Jason, but the – so the utilization is down a bit year-over-year, but the headcount is growing slower than the revenue. I see the fixed price is up a bit. I’m just trying to get – basically, my question is it looks like pricing is rising. Is that too blunt for a conclusion?
Jason Peterson: Yes. There’s probably – okay. I – the answer would be yes, and they’re probably – we sort of peeled it back a layer, so there’ll probably be two factors inside that. So as we discussed with David in the last set of questions, is that there’s a slight shift towards on-site and then at the same time, we are seeing an increase in our rates on average across our customer base. A lot of the rate increases do come in, in the first half. And so you’ve got the combination of actual kind of rate increases and then the subtle shift towards on-site, which would also sort of push up the revenue per employee.
Jamie Friedman: Got it. Okay. And then there is a slight increase in fixed price. I know the first question was about how you’re pricing some of the new offerings. Is this that or is it something else? It’s not – I’m just looking at the fact sheet, it’s not a huge difference, but about 100 basis points. But is there any way to read into that?
Jason Peterson: You’re not seeing a significant shift in fixed price versus T&M. I do think over time and someday we’ll continue to explore. But at this time, we’re still substantially in the time and materials business from a pricing standpoint.
Operator: Our next question is from Arvind Ramnani with KeyBanc. Please proceed.
Arvind Ramnani: I just wanted to ask about the demand environment. How do you characterize the demand environment today versus kind of what expectations were at the beginning of the year? And how do you also characterize the competitive environment?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Probably, a traditional answer. We’re still seeing very stable and strong demand across all our offerings. Again, it’s difficult for us to assess the whole market because we’re relatively small in comparison to our large competitors. But in our area, it’s very similar demand to what was in the past. There are some changes structurally that’s why we were talking about intelligent, automation and RPAs, specifically on kind of proof of concept, the first engagements, and we see that it’s potentially might grow faster than other parts. So there are probably some other smaller aspects of this change. But in general, again, it’s a – pretty consistent with the past. And from competition, I would say the same things. I don’t – we don’t see any significant changes in competitors’ offerings.
Arvind Ramnani: Great. And on these emerging technologies, you touched upon automation, but if you kind of look at automation, AI or like – even some other things such as blockchain, is there like kind of increased appetite or – when you look at – maybe it may not be impacting your revenue, but when you look at your R&D spend or amount of – kind of investments going in the back end to develop the capabilities, is – how is that – what are you expecting for the emerging technologies over the next 12 to 18 months?
Arkadiy Dobkin: As we mentioned before, we are doing these investments pretty consistently in the past. We were talking about our internal [indiscernible] where we’re experimenting. But we also do believe we have some advantage because part of our business, almost 20% of our business, it’s software service systems for technology and software companies. And in many of these cases, we have opportunity to be exposed to new trends and new technologies, including automation and RPAs and artificial intelligent type of applications. And we’re doing this as part of our delivery engagements. And then in many cases, we actually have an opportunity to go together with our clients to their clients for building specific solutions. So we tried to explain it before that we have this type of advantage, and I think it’s helping us right now and we hope will help in the future because we strategically continue to serve this part of the market.
Operator: Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Brandon Avon [ph] on for Jason. Just wanted to get a sense of how financial services was relative to your expectations in the quarter? Is there anything notable to call out? And maybe talk more broadly about what you’re seeing in terms of spending at the large banks?
Jason Peterson: Yes. So we continue to a very strong growth in our Financial Services practice. So you see, we’re over 30%. We did get a little bit of benefit from our acquisitions. So if we were to strip that out, we’re still sort of approaching 30% in the very high 20s. We continue to drive revenues from – more kind of the digital transformation and our experience in wealth management and other platform technologies has really – may have been beneficial to us. I don’t know, Ark, do you have anything else you want to say about the Financial Services space?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don’t think there is, again, any specific changes. We’re working with established vendors, but we will – established clients in financial space, but we’re working on more digital transformation or digital type of platform. This is – probably allow us to continue growing. At the same time, we’re involved in some specific fintech applications with the smaller clients. So it’s giving us opportunity to continuously grow as well.
Jason Peterson: So I don’t know if the demand has changed, but we continue to see quite significant demand in our space.
Unidentified Analyst : Great. That’s really helpful. And just as a follow-up. Obviously, FX is – could be a headwind now on the back half, and you called that out from a revenue perspective. I was just curious how big has the – the recent FX headwinds will that be on your EPS in 3Q and 4Q?
Jason Peterson: That’s a good question. So we’re actually pretty well hedged. And so we’ve got – we’ve always had kind of a natural hedge. In the Ukraine and in Belarus, actually, the salaries are notionally in U.S. dollars and so we don’t see volatility there. We’ve got currencies in Europe, which are primarily sort of expense currencies, the Polish zloty, the Hungarian forint. We’ve got revenues driven between – in the euro and in the pound in which you find that there’s some degree of correlation between those. So when the U.S. dollar strengthens, you may see less revenue from a euro perspective, but you also generally see a decline in costs in some of our Central European delivery centers. And then we’ve also hedged the ruble. And so what you see is that – I – we’re in a position right now where even as the dollar strengthens, what it tends to do is have an impact on reported revenue and reported revenue growth rate, again, a negative impact, but it only has a very modest or slight impact on EPS.
Operator: Our next question is from Frank Atkins with SunTrust. Please proceed.
Frank Atkins: Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask first about the Life Science & Healthcare vertical. What’s driving some of the strength there?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. We mentioned before that it’s one of the smallest verticals for us still. And 1 or 2 clients kind of changes might impact specific quarter. I think we’re coming back to normal there. And it’s practically in line with the company growth right now versus before, we have some slowdown in 1 or 2 clients. So we hope it would be growing more in line with the overall growth of EPAM.
Frank Atkins: Okay. That’s helpful. And then can you talk a little bit about the talent environment? What you’re doing to attract and retain talent? And were there any changes in attrition on a quarter-over-quarter basis?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Attrition, I think in line with last year right now. It’s sequentially up a little bit. In general, again – and this is our probably consistent permanent answer to this question. Environment for hiring talent and keeping talent is very difficult and it was last quarter and last year and three, four years ago as well. So basically, we don’t feel that it’s ever going to be easier. At the same time, we continuously invest in trainings, education, looking for better opportunities inside of the company for people to grow in. And I don’t think there is any magic here. So that’s a continuous effort which we’re really committed to do.
Operator: Our next question is from Vladimir Bespalov with VTB Capital. Please proceed.
Vladimir Bespalov: My first question is on your geographic breakdown of revenues. There is some slowdown in Europe in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Is it FX driven or like – if there is anything else behind this? And the second question I have on your Hyderabad office. From what I saw in EBIT capacity of this office, I saw – I think the numbers were from 1,000 people to 1,600 people so – but it’s not reflected in your hiring as far as I could see. Maybe you could elaborate a little bit. Are you going to hire more people? Or this is built up on your current presence in India following the acquisition of Alliance Global Services and how this fits your strategy to develop the APAC region, which is still small, but growing pretty good?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. Let me start from different order, like from Hyderabad. We moved to very well built new location. And we’re operating in India for the third year, and it’s clearly was a new experience for us and we learned a lot. And we are bringing engineering culture, which we have in EPAM, to our locations in India. And it was, again, a lot of learning during these several years. The decision to move was actually attributed to our belief that we would be able to grow because for last years, we maintained practically a flat headcount in the region. Now, we’re much more comfortable that we would be able to benefit from our investment. So we’re careful where the significant clients move to the regions because very good review on the quality of the services, which we started to deliver from there. And this location would allow us to grow with the next several years. So on Europe, yes, I’ll pass it to Jason here.
Jason Peterson: No, I think we’re still very pleased with the demand environment in Europe and also pleased with the growth. I think largely what you did see with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar that does have a negative impact on the growth rates in Europe. And so right now, the environment there tends to have continued strong demand. And so I don’t think there’s anything to take away from the somewhat slower growth rate there.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.
Mike Reid: This is Mike Reid on for Joe. Just wondering what the impact to the quarter was from Continuum and then maybe a little detail on the integration, how that’s going.
Jason Peterson: Yes. And so probably, two points. I’ll answer a question that you didn’t ask. So we only had about two weeks of revenue – of Continuum revenue in our Q1 results. And so you do get a bump sort of in sequential growth because they’re having 13 weeks at Continuum. And Continuum is – about 2% of the growth is coming from Continuum and that’s consistent for the full fiscal year. Then Ark, do you want to talk a little bit about integration and just kind of how things are going with the Continuum acquisition?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Sure. Like – clearly, we’re just a little bit of 4 months in this. And it’s probably too early to do any conclusions. It’s usually only – even after plus 12 months, but we do see a number of very interesting opportunities, which we started to go after together. We have already exposure of Continuum services to EPAM client base and opposite a client capabilities presenting and even starting some smaller projects to clients which originally came from Continuum. From this point of view, we’re thinking pretty good growth right now.
Mike Reid: Okay. Great. And then are you partnering with providers in the automation implementation? And if so, have you named who you’re working with?
Arkadiy Dobkin: In what implementation?
Mike Reid: Automation, RPA or any of the...
Arkadiy Dobkin: We – basically, like in any other engagements, we’re working with some other vendors on the same implementations like on e-commerce or big data, it could be some other vendors. It’s exactly the same story in RPA, but we don’t partner with anybody specifically, with exception of providers of the specific platforms like Automation Anywhere or Blue Prism or WorkFusion.
Operator: Our next question is from Avishai Kantor with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.
Avishai Kantor: I have a quick follow-up. I may have missed it, but can you talk about trends within the top 5 clients? If I’m not mistaken, for me, your revenues really have been – accelerated significantly this quarter. Is it from one specific client? Is it a couple of clients?
Jason Peterson: I mean, I think what you see is that – from a concentration standpoint, we continue to improve. But certainly, we’ve had – our top clients could – many of our top clients continue to grow quite rapidly. And at the same time, it got to the same story, I think, we’ve told you in the past which is that we’re getting a lot of growth from our new customers as well. But certainly, we see some nice growth from our large, established customers in addition to the growth that we’re getting from new logos.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Arkadiy Dobkin for closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you. And thank you, everybody, for participating. We do believe it was strong quarter despite of some FX influences from results, and we do believe that we will be continue growing with – within the promises we shared like before. So thank you very much, and see you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the EPAM Systems First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. David Straube, Head of Investor Relations for EPAM Systems. Thank you. You may begin. 
David Straube: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company’s first quarter 2018 results. If you have not, a copy is available at epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today’s call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that some of the comments made on today’s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties as described in the company’s earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP and are available in our Q1 earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you David and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. Let me begin with few financial highlights. We delivered a strong first quarter with revenue of US$424 million reflecting 31% year-over-year growth or 26% in constant currency terms. Our revenue growth was broad based both geographically and across all of our industry verticals. In addition, we delivered a strong non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.93, which represents 29% growth from Q1 of 2017.  Our strong start to 2018 is in part the result of the continued execution of our strategy across the three major pillars of our business; our capabilities and offerings, our people and our key markets and customers.  Looking at our capabilities and offerings, we remain focused on expanding our leadership position in digital transformation programs and connect to digital platform services, helping our clients develop and integrate a full range of offerings to optimize their processes and deliver positive returns on their technology investments.  We are putting a lot of our attention today in to developing capabilities in the area of intelligence automation, RPA and AI and machine learning, which is becoming very important for us as cross-functional effort among our engineering, general consultant and specific industry focused teams. We also see growing opportunities in the IOT space, where closely connected networks and devices are challenging businesses to create full cycle intelligent enterprises covering end-to-end business needs of certain customers where data-driven decision making creates a completely different level of efficiencies and triggers opportunities to bring new revenue generating ideas and corresponding business models to life much faster than it was possible before.  It is very clear that the use of digital in the industrial and manufacturing sectors is only just starting and will require to fully realize a very unique mix of creative capabilities and strong engineering disciplines. We do believe that focusing more and more on IT technologies together with advanced automation and DevOps, we are going to be well positioned to help our clients in such sectors to bring to life new solutions and to navigate successfully the challenges ahead, and in turn to allow us to grow further too. In response, we are continuously expanding our capabilities both organically as well as through acquisitions. Our most recent example specifically related to the need in strong cross-over capabilities between physical and digital worlds. In March, we announced the acquisition of Continuum Innovation, a design firm headquartered in Boston with studios in Milan, Seoul and Shanghai. This acquisition is important to us, because while we strengthen our general consultant capabilities and enhances our existing digital and service design practices, it also brings to EPAM a human centered approach to physical design and physical product development.  In addition, with this acquisition, we would be able to expand our R&D efforts, which we started by introducing of EPAM (inaudible). Now with Continuum (inaudible) approach, which enable multi-functional teams to collaborate much more seamlessly across the product development lifecycles to enable sophisticated physical and digital prototyping, we would be able to test complete product, ideas and experiences practically in real time with instant customer feedback.  Lastly to bring it all together, we are very much focusing on developing our consultant services across business experience and technology disciplines in to our mainstream integrated (inaudible) to increase overall value for the solutions we deliver for clients.  Moving to our people, engagement, productivity and talent development. We ended the quarter with over 23,700 delivery professionals, a 21% increase year-over-year and net addition of more than 700 production professionals during Q1. Our total headcount ended at more than 26,700 employees. Simply put focus on our people and their development remains critical to our success.  In Q1, we continued our investments in learning and development programs across all key locations. At the same time, we are putting a lot of efforts in rethinking many of such programs taking in account new advances in educational methods and the growing needs for skills and capabilities necessary for the engagement we are going to be involved with our clients in the very near future.. Sizeable continued investments also directed to our constantly advanced talent development and employee engagement ecosystems, as well as in to engineering productivity platforms and tools, some of which we are bringing to open source market.  Turning to a few clients’ highlights and market update; all of our clients in every industry recognize the landscape they compete in. Client fundamental has shifted on the focus on customer experience and engagement from one side and analytics and highest possible level of automation from another are even more critical for success.  EPAM has been working with Aer Lingus digital and mobile group in the areas of web and mobile development, backend services, DevOps and enterprise service business integration resulting in significant growth of its digital commercial area.  Recently, we extended our five year relationship with Aer Lingus to develop new ways to enhance the Aer Lingus guest experience and automated services and operations. This multi-year relationship highlights our expertise in building specific solution to increase customer satisfaction including leveraging advanced data analytics to provide more personalized insight and online and offline (inaudible) that connect the physical and digital customer experience. Another example of delivering differentiated solutions is our work with AS Watson, the world’s largest health and beauty retail group with over 14,000 stores in 24 markets, serving over 28 million customers per week. Our teams develop and support AS Watson e-commerce platform, provide necessary changes to their European store system to be in sync with engagement initiatives and in addition bring big data analytics, [client] management and business process automation capabilities to glue all of that together. In result and close collaboration with AS Watson, we collectively develop and support a full range of digital transformation strategies and have been honored to be recognized as an official technology partner for ASW Group.  Taking a look at our vertical performance in the first quarter, financial services our largest vertical, finished the quarter with 38% growth year-over-year, driven by clients responding to regulatory changes, digitalization and transformation, in addition to demand for EPAM wealth management platform.  Travel and consumer grew 28% for the quarter, customer experience and e-commerce sufficiency is major focus for clients in the vertical with the main focus on personalization to help drive better customer engagement and loyalty. Software and Hi-Tech grew approximately 20% year-over-year for the quarter, with growth coming from continued demand for strong software engineering skills and advanced technology practices necessary to accelerate product delivery to the market. We’ve also partnered with our clients in this sector to push the boundaries of digital innovation through advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and augmented reality.  Business information and media, formerly we called it media and entertainment posted 32% growth year-over-year driven by engagement focused on productizing voice and video platform in the telecom and cable industries as well as the technologies to help clients manage the creation and distribution of content. Life science and healthcare grew 19% over the same quarter last year, driven by the healthcare industry focus on delivering patient centric care through interactive apps and hospitals of the future initiatives. In addition, we are helping our life science clients to streamline the end-to-end processes to maintain with compliance while driving smart engagement initiative with physicians and consumers.  And lastly, our emerging vertical continues a strong trajectory delivering 54% growth, driven primarily by industrial engineering energy and automotive. And finally, by looking at customer concentration across our clients, we’d like to share that our top 20 accounts grew more than 22% and growth outside the top 20 account was more than 38% compared to the same quarter last year.  With that let met turn it over to Jason for a detailed financial update. 
Jason Peterson: Thank you Ark and good morning everyone. I’ll start with some financial highlights, then talk about profitability, cash flow and end on guidance for fiscal 2018 and with Q2. In the first quarter, we delivered very strong topline performance, exceeded our profitability expectations and grew earnings per share.  Here are a few key highlight from the quarter. Revenue closed at $424.1 million, reflecting a 30.6% year-over-year growth rate or 26% growth in constant currency terms. Sequentially our Q1 growth rate was 6.2%. From a geographic perspective, North America our largest region representing 56.5% of our Q1 revenues grew 26.5% year-over-year. Europe, representing 36.1% of our Q1 revenues grew 33.9% year-over-year or 23.4% in constant currency. CIS representing 5.1% of our Q1 revenues grew 49.8% year-over-year or 46.8% in constant currency. And finally APAC grew 51.9% or 46.3% in constant currency and now represents 2.3% of our revenues. Moving on the income statement, our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 34.5% compared to 36% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 36.5%, compared to 37.7% for the same quarter last year. The year-over-year decline in gross margin reflects the impact of foreign exchange and a higher level of accrued variable compensation based on the strong start to the year.  GAAP SG&A was 2.07% of revenue compared to 24.2% in Q1 of last year and non-GAAP SG&A came in at 18.6% of revenue compared to 20.8% in the same period last year. We are pleased with the efficiency we have achieved in our SG&A spend and will continue to manage SG&A closely in both dollar terms and as a percentage of revenues.  For the remainder of the year, we expect to manage SG&A at a slightly higher level measure as a percentage of revenues. Our current level of SG&A reflects our continued investment in talent acquisition, the expansion of our global footprint and expansion of capabilities with a focus on supporting long term sustainable growth.  GAAP income from operations was 48.7 million or 11.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to 31 million or 9.5% of revenue in the Q1 last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was 67.7 million or 16% of revenue in the quarter compared to 49.3 million or 15.2% of revenue in Q1 of last year.  Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at negative 34.5%, which reflects the impact of a 22.5 million one-time net benefit related to tax planning and the recently passed US tax reform legislation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate which excludes the one-time benefit and other adjustments was 22%.  Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.15 which includes lower tax rate partially offset by higher stock compensation expense in the quarter. Excluding the one-time tax benefit previously mentioned, GAAP EPS was $0.75. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.93, reflecting a 29.2% increase over the same quarter in fiscal 2017.  In Q1 there were approximately 56.2 million diluted shares outstanding. Utilization was 77.6% compared to 77.5% in the same quarter last year and 78.8% in Q4. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash from operations for Q1 was $7.3 million compared to $31.2 million in the same quarter last year. Free cash flow was negative $3.4 million compared to a positive $23.4 million in the same quarter last year.  Our cash flow from operations in Q1 reflects a payout of a higher level of variable compensation, related to 2017 performance in addition to an uptick in DSO. Total organic DSO was 83 days compared to 81 days at the end of Q4 fiscal 2017 and 77 days in the same quarter last year. We continue to focus on managing our total DSO performance in the low 80s.  Turning now to guidance, starting with fiscal 2018, revenue growth for fiscal 2018 will now be at least 27% reported or at least 25% in constant currency, after factoring in 2% estimated currency tailwinds. As a reminder, our full year revenue outlook reflects approximately a 2% contribution from inorganic revenues.  We expect GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 12% to 13% and non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to now be approximately 4% which reflects our tax spending efforts in response to the US tax reform legislation. We expect non-GAAP tax rate to continue to be approximately 22%.  Earnings per share, we now expect GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $3.77 for the full year and non-GAAP EPS will now be at least $4.11 for the full year. We now expect weighted average share count of 56.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding.  For Q2 of FY ’18 revenues will be at least 445 million for the second quarter, reflecting a growth rate of approximately 28% reported or approximately 26% in constant currency, after factoring in approximately 2% estimated currency tailwinds. For the second quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%.  We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 10% and non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 22%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $0.82 for the quarter and non-GAAP EPS will be at least $0.98 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 56.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding.  And finally a few key assumptions which support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock compensation expense is now expected to approximately 14.2 million in Q2, 14.6 million in Q3 and 15 million in Q4. Amortization of intangibles is now expected to be approximately 2.2 million in each remaining quarter for the fiscal year. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately 1.5 million in each remaining quarter. Tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments is now expected to be around 4 million in each remaining quarter. Lastly, we expect excess tax benefits to now be around 6.1 million in Q2 and 3.3 million in each remaining quarter.  In summary, we’re pleased for the Q1 results, which reflects strong broad based growth across our verticals and geographies. A result is a diverse mix of projects and works we are delivering for our clients. A unique position in the market combined with our solid fundamentals positions us well for continued growth in fiscal 2018.  With that let’s open the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar: The raised guidance just to clarify that primarily reflects outperformance in 1Q, and then as we look at sort of the cadence of revenue growth to the rest of the year, good to see in 1Q that headcount growth reaccelerated. Should we make that continuing assumption so that the gap between headcount growth and revenue growth sort of narrows as we proceed through the year?
Jason Peterson: Our expectation would be that utilization will actually increase somewhat in Q2 and probably throughout the remainder of the year, certainly in the second half. And so utilization, we guided to the fact and we expected that utilization would come down from Q4 to Q1 of 2018, with the idea that we wanted to make certain that we had sufficient resources to be able to support our growth in the year. But throughout the remainder of the year, you should expect that utilization will increase somewhat. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Is there a utilization target, although that’s not my follow-up question, if you could just adjust that and could you just repeat the first one? Let me ask the second already which that -. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Ash this is Arkadiy. So you’re breaking out connections is not too good. But as I understand you’re asking if increasing revenue in Q1 is a one-time situation or it would be propagated over the – and does this pull in as we as the year number as we’re seeing and that’s what we’re guiding to. And increase in number of people, it’s a reflection of how high utilization numbers at the end of last year and do we play in to improved fertilizations slightly during the year, that’s what Jason was referring to. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar: You mentioned a couple of times progress on SG&A hires, which really is sort of the front end consulting type of people I’m assuming. Can you comment on the progress, what kind of people you are looking for in any particular end market, how that effort is going?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So that’s a different combination of people clearly, and we always were saying that one of the opportunities for us to improve and create better end market connection with our clients. So we’re looking for consultants which is partially not billable account managers, number of account managers and vertical expert is very different utilization target that our general population of engineering. So that’s why I created pressure on the G&A as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. 
Ramsey El Assal: I wanted to ask you about the general talent market, we’ve had some of your competitors talk about intensifying competition for talent. Are you seeing any sort of more sudden intensification out there versus what’s just been going on in the course of business recently, and I also want to just ask what is your sort of toolkit in terms of retention? Obviously you can throw money at employees, but what else can you do to sort of make sure that they stick around?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it’s pretty consistent creation of our public life, and I think a situation with silent competition, all of this was very difficult. And I think we’re talking about it practically each quarter, and it’s not related to Eastern Europe or India. Again as you’re really pointing out, it’s all over the United States and rest of Europe as well. So this is constant pressure. And we’re living in this situation for most of our years of existence.  At the same time, we paying a lot of attention to retention and it feels like, we mentioned today that we’re continually investing in internal system to understand motivations of our people and we’re creating different rotational programs, different competency spot, different conferences like the type of project each people have opportunity to participate, highly (inaudible) as well.  So there is no one simple answer and probably it would be like very separate discussion. But we’re putting a lot of efforts around this. And our investment probably in talent management and retention over the last year is certainly the way I like is increasing too. We’ll probably discuss how much we invested in each of our function and how different it is today versus like five, six years ago when we started with a public company. 
Jason Peterson: So we continue to be successful in terms of bringing resources in to EPAM in addition to the attrition rate throughout 2017 decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis throughout the entire year. And the attrition that we saws here in Q1 is actually quite a bit lower than what we saw in Q1 of 2017. So we think we’ve done a fair job of managing retention and adding resources. So we feel good about our ability to continue to drive revenue growth based on resource availability. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: But it’s a challenge and a challenge for everybody. So this is one of the main challenges in the industry.
Ramsey El Assal: And a follow-up, I wanted to ask you about the internal implementation at some of the productivity enhancing digital technology delivering to clients. In other words, what is the internal opportunity for technologies such as AI or intelligent automation or advanced analytics? Are you implementing these things internally or is there an opportunity too and could that have any impact on your expense line in the future, kind of a long dated question.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Good question and the answer is yes. We’re trying to apply whatever we’re thinking might apply to clients and experimenting in our kind of internal (inaudible) how we can improve internal efficiency, because of our SG&A cost and just improving services insight of a (inaudible). So that’s one of the things we’re constantly doing. And this is through, not only for this, but any type of technology we could impart internal operations. So this always was part of our effort, and some proof of concept which we’re doing internally including demonstrating to the clients as an example how it could be visualized. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. 
Jason Kupferberg: I just wanted to start with a question on guidance. I know you took up the full year EPS by $0.04, you did just beat Q1 by a few pennies and I think you are picking up a few more pennies from the lower share count outlook for the year. So, I just wanted to see that this implies relative to your margin outlook. I know you’re maintaining a 16% to 17%, but can we get to the middle of the range of does the lower part of the range seem more likely because obviously you took up the revenue outlook again although a little bit. So I just wanted to make sure we’ve got the different pieces calibrated here. 
Jason Peterson: So we expect to be in the range of 16% to 17%, as we’ve sort of guided. We do think that we’ll see an improvement in revenue that’s largely associated with our organic revenue, so that’s not coming from the Continuum acquisition yet. So again it’s an improvement in the demand environment and what we are seeing on the horizon. I don’t think I could comment as to exactly where we’re going to be in the range, but generally what we do see is in the second half of the year is that we do see improvements in our adjusted IFO, yet our (inaudible) revenues grow and that’s when we see an improvement in the utilization numbers. 
Jason Kupferberg: Just a revenue question, so you mentioned financial services vertical growing 38% year-over-year, I think you did have an easy comparison there, but nonetheless including some strong underlying trends. I wanted to see if you can give us a little bit more color there, was it UBS, was it a combination of clients and maybe you can just talk more broadly about what you’re seeing in terms of project based spending at some of the larger banks, because it seems like there has been some mixed signals in the market as far as where that stands at this juncture in the year. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: There’s definitely not one answer to the question, so it’s a combination of things. And as we – again over the last quarters we are pointing out that we are not necessary with representation of financial services across the global delivery industry and we’re focusing on a little bit different subset of engagement and applications which has given us better opportunity to grow.  And this is probably consistent with previous statements this quarter. But on top of this we have a couple of new logos which we started within last nine to six months, where each contributed the growth in financial services for Q1. 
Jason Peterson: So we’re seeing growth from both the existing customers and then we’re seeing significant growth from new customers. So that’s why you see the high growth rate in our business, and as Ark said we are just participating in a different space, wealth management platform, asset management platforms being more customer facing technologies. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Khatri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. 
Moshe Khatri: So guys this is a usually strong quarter for Q1. Am I right here in terms of the growth that we’re seeing in terms of the guidance raised? Is there an uptick in the [management] or anything that’s kind of fundamentally pushing this, that’s a big picture question? And then in terms of some of the metrics, maybe you could talk a bit about organic growth for the quarter, organic growth that’s embedded in the actual guidance and then what do are we factoring on the guidance side in terms of pricing and legislations. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: It probably sounds unusual from the numbers point of view, probably doesn’t sound so unusual for us internally here. And then I think we’ve seen bigger number which is attributed to a number of clients which were growing pretty flat during the last couple of quarters. And again, for the rest of the year, we’ve seen exactly what we’re guiding for and as we try to do each time. 
Jason Peterson: I can talk a little bit about Q1, so if you look at the quarters, we’ve probably picked up about $1 million related to foreign exchange versus the rates that we were using at the time of guidance. You’ll remember that the Continuum acquisition occurred at the very tail end of Q1, so we only had about two weeks worth of revenue from Continuum. So that had a very modest impact on revenues and so really what you saw versus guidance is just substantial has kind of over performed based on demand in the market. 
Moshe Khatri: What about pricing and legislation in terms of what’s embedded in the guidance?
Jason Peterson: It’s consistent with the guidance that we had at the beginning of the year. I will reiterate that in terms of the growth and the increase in the guidance is that at this time it’s exclusively from our organic revenue. We’re seeing some nice traction in terms of customer engagement and in meetings and we do think that longer term that you’ll see some nice benefit from the Continuum acquisition. At this time the take-up in guidance for revenue is exclusively due to our organic growth.  From a wage inflation standpoint, it’s pretty consistent with what we’ve talked about in the past. It’s maybe up slightly, but I would put in kind of the modest as we continue to get price increases from customers on an annual basis at least a subset of our customer base. We continue to see opportunities for full price increases with new engagements, and generally I think that the pricing opportunities and the wage inflation are not materially different than what we’ve seen in the past. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arvind Ramnani with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. 
Unidentified Analyst: This is Brian [James] sitting in for Arvind Ramnani. Just a quick question here, our checklist clients have been overwhelmingly positive on the quality of technology talent and productivity that they get from EPAM. These companies are much larger IT services providers – vendors. Have you found a competitive set change in the last couple of years and what are you doing to make sure that you stay ahead of the competition?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Again it could be very little concern, just in a couple of sentence we say already [key] towards the communication to [denote] this time. We’re coming from a really strong contingent on the ground and on top of this we’re trying to push the right client facing capabilities, industry expertise, any means consultant experience, experience designed in experience consultancy. And with all this we’re trying to keep up our engineering strength because that’s what actually matter when you delivering whatever that wasn’t required. And that’s a continuous effort and that’s what we think probably still differentiate us, and we don’t want to lose this advantage and engineering part, while we’re trying to go up in value chain with additional services. That’s not so magical. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. 
Maggie Nolan: I wanted to ask about Continuum, it seems like those employees have a slightly different skillset than some of your core EPAM employees. So I’m wondering if you think that this business is scalable for EPAM and then what does that integration timeline look like in terms of when you’ll be able to really start driving revenue synergies. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we’ll be able to answer in much more detail like in 18 to 24 months from now. But in general, within the last five, six years we were aiding different type of skills to a point which we didn’t have inside and continuing one of these attempts as well to bring different type of people and see how together we would be able to impart clients better.  And at the same time, it’s not completely different to EPAM because Continuum is a combination of user experience and design thinking together it’s a physical product expertise from industrial design to prototyping of real physical products and to reducing with our attempt to play better role in or a key role with our clients with industrial engineering and utility energy. So that would be very important addition to us, the same like in healthcare and retail.  So we’ll see how it would be working out, there’s no simple answer right now.
Jason Peterson: So we haven’t really included any revenue synergies in our guidance. We’re seeing that we already are sort of engaging mutually with clients, and what we think overtime that we’ll be collectively able to engage on larger programs as we sort of combine the capabilities of the two different companies. 
Maggie Nolan: And was there any customer overlap with Continuum customers and EPAM customers and are there any clients that you think could become meaningful contributors to EPAM’s growth kind of in a later timeline that you’ve outlined?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I do believe there are a number of opportunities between our client portfolios and there is some slight love, but we’re working in different direction, but the whole goal is how actually to putting it together. That’s exactly the point. I think we will see how to work in line 18 to 24 months with a short term impact. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question. 
Mayank Tandon: Ark wanted to get your thoughts on pricing, in terms of, are you seeing an increase in transaction based and outcome based pricing, some of peers have called that out as being a driver? Just wanted to get your thoughts in terms of if you’re seeing model shift with your clients?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think, in general, our pricing model is not changing much. So there are some experimentation with our companies but it’s extremely small number or proportion of our revenue right now. Very insignificant, but we experimented with this. In general, it’s the same challenge we have. We still need to improve in market capabilities to make sure that we reflect on potentially better outcome and solution in case we do it. So, again, I don’t think anything changing significantly in our pricing situation.
Jason Peterson: So we are still around or above 90% in terms of T&M pricing or time and materials pricing. 
Mayank Tandon: And then just another question around the verticals, obviously really strong quarter across the board, but I guess the one area that might be a little bit softer was the healthcare life sciences. So if you could, just maybe, talk about that, just any shift in the trends there?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it’s also in line. Last quarter’s Healthcare Life science was softer than other, but I don’t seem it to get the reflection of the market. It’s a specific situation, several clients and we do believe that life science healthcare will reach the same level of growth which we felt like in several next few quarters. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.
Joseph Foresi: The move in to consulting’s been obviously difficult and expensive for others. So I just want to get a sense of what your strategy is as you move up the value chain, and any thoughts on what margins could do longer term as you take on more expensive consultants. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Our approach right now is relatively simple. We’re not trying to build completely separated line of business or revenue stream coming from consultant. We’re trying to find the right kind of combination for consulting and design heavily supported by our engineering capabilities. So basically we’re trying to empower final solution in which we build through right decisions and right design. So that’s why our consultant line of revenue not necessary will be soon leased to the separate one, because this is how we’re trying to bring more value to the clients and probably eventually improve margins not to kind of make more operations to margins. But it would require investments and that’s what we’re doing and clearly in some of the quarters it would be pressure once the margins before you achieve what we already confirmed. 
Joseph Foresi: And then just on the margin side of things, what’s the balance between gross margin and SG&A or operating margins look like throughout the year. It looks like you’re headed towards the upper end of the guided range, and where is the SG&A leverage coming from? Is that coming from upside due to topline, is it better utilization, how should we think about those moving factors?
Jason Peterson: The overall profitability standpoint is, we had expected that we would see a dip in gross margin in part because we had intended to take down the utilization so that we could grow throughout the remainder of the year. At the same time we’ve been very focused on improving our SG&A efficiency and you kind of get there two ways, one is by looking at – there are probably three ways.  One is looking at current spending and seeing what you can do to optimize that spending. Other is to make certain that you’re adding appropriate headcount and making investments in the areas that will most effectively certify revenue for office. The third obviously is the revenue growth, and so to the extent that you’re growing revenues rapidly and then you’re controlling your SG&A expense that the outer (inaudible) produces in the SG&A efficiency and that’s something that we’ve been very focused on. Well since we’ve put our plan in place for 2018 and as we execute throughout the year. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: And we were like talking about lack of additional corporate structures for our site as we were growing very fast, and during the last year we put a lot of investment in this area including (inaudible) issue, people attrition, people management, talent acquisition. So and now we’re kind of a little bit are benefiting from this, because we build structure and now we just need to support it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question. 
Jamie Friedman: It’s Jamie at Susquehanna. I just wanted to ask my two upfront. Jason I apologize to ask you to do this again, is the Continuum in or not in because I thought, I heard you say that numbers or DNA that’s my first one. And then second one is, Ark is there anything unique about the CIS Eastern Europe delivery organization in terms of either attrition or supply, because everyone else in the industry is calling on rapid attrition range inflation etcetera. Is there anything unique to that specific delivery region. 
Jason Peterson: So first up from the Continuum standpoint, for our full year guidance Continuum is in at somewhere less than 2% of revenues and that’s consistent with the press release we did at the time of the acquisition as well as the updated guidance. The point that I was trying to make earlier on (inaudible) wasn’t clear is that the increase in our guided growth rate for 2018 is a result of our [mechanic] revenue growth, not due to synergies associated with Continuum at this time. And so Continuum is in the number, but we’ve actually taken up the growth rate guidance for the full year, and that’s exclusively due to the strength that we see in the organic demand. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: And as to talent pool, I think we experienced the same pressure which everybody else. So the relatively is there are significant differences between different Eastern European countries we operate in. But in general we’re experiencing exactly the same challenges which all companies experiencing globally. So there is a global lack of talent, there is a pressure on rate inflation, there are a lot of efforts which we need to put to retain people and let away people. So that’s all over the place. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Louis Miscioscia with Pivotal Research Group. Please proceed with your question. 
Louis Miscioscia: I was going to ask question on margins, but I think you hit that pretty well so far. So let me ask you about automation, it seems that RPA in automation to Cognizant is really started to kick in. Could you maybe talk about how much you’re seeing that and what customers are asking you to do. And then my follow-up question would be to expand that out, to also talk about what you’re seeing with the other new types of technology, AI, you know everything is block chain. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Well we’ve definitely seen a lot of interest in automation because for many company that’s one of the few opportunities actually to improve the iterations and for many traditional establishing companies and financial services, insurance space, this could be huge savings as there are a lot of experimentation there, and it’s very challenging because of usually a combination of what people say in automation but change of the process and internally engineering as well as a combination of all.  You guys been seeing this, you’re paying attention to this, we are participating in this as well. Probably very much in line with what Cognizant and (inaudible). But again we try to bring our engineering advantage there, because with all these new technologies, with all this new products on the market, there are a lot of engineering challenges to make it efficient and implement it. So we hope that we will benefit from this.  So with regards to block chain and machine learning and artificial intelligence, this is still pretty (inaudible), but we do believe that it would withdraw faster (inaudible) and western incompetence’s and expertise all the time. Also just to mention that we traditionally have some advantage because we have a good portion of our revenue coming from software technology companies and we see and are helping to experiment even in units of project development stages with our clients.  And we’re seeing through their eyes sometimes what and how first implementation look like and actually bringing it back to our quarterly clients as well. So I think we have some advantage because of our heritage and portfolio of our clients. 
Louis Miscioscia: On the automation side, could you possibly quantify maybe how much of the different project you’re working on or if it’s moving from more proof of concepts to scale or something?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So on (inaudible) it’s probably dozens of projects and some of them are definitely moving to implementations. But it’s still experimentation because this implementation still have to prove that it wants which products. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vladimir Bespalov with VTB Capital. Please proceed with your question. 
Vladimir Bespalov: I have a couple of questions, one is on working capital, you mentioned that your day sales outstanding increased and this reduced the cash flow from operations. So how should we look at this going forward, are you going to decrease the sale outstanding in the coming quarters, just could you comment on this? And the second question is on your client concentration. When I look at the trends quarter-by-quarter, throughout last year there was a decrease in like top five client’s concentration, top 10 client concentration and top 20 client concentration. But if we compare the first quarter with the fourth quarter and there is slight increase in each category. So basically do you think that the current client concentration mix is optimal and you’re going to reduce it further in terms of like servicing both big clients and small clients, getting big orders and small orders and so on. 
Jason Peterson: Just in terms of the working capital, yes, DSO did go up by a couple of days between Q4 and Q1. So that did have a negative impact on working capital. But someone just going to get a significant amount of focus throughout the remainder of the year, and we remain committed to keeping DSO in the low-80s.  The other thing that we talked about we have a variable compensation program, it’s in part, the program that we use to retain our employees. There is an annual payout of that variable compensation plan and that occurs for the most part in Q1 of other fiscal year, and then a little bit of that variable compensation is actually paid out in Q2 in certain other countries in the CIS region.  So generally what you see is that there is somewhat lower cash flow generation in Q1, just courtesy of the variable compensation payout. Then all things equal you see an improvement in cash flow generation in Q2 and again an improvement in Q3 again all things held equal. So I that would kind of address the cash flow item.  In terms of concentration of customers, do you want to talk about Ark?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it’s also a consistent trend during the last couple of years. So we – as we mentioned we have new logos come in and some of them growing pretty fast, and growth below our top 20 is way over 20% right now. So, I think this is just a deflection of reality in the specification. 
Jason Peterson: And quite simply we are growing both with existing customers and with new customers. We have a significant amount of revenue coming from again what we call new customers, which are measured as customers, which we engineered revenues in the last 12 months and so we’re getting about 40% of our revenue growth from those customer and then the 60% from the existing accounts and there’s substantial growth opportunities in both the existing customers and in new customer opportunities.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, our final question today comes from the line of Avishai Kantor with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. 
Avishai Kantor: From a consulting perspective, have you considered any joint ventures or partnerships with standalone consultancies or front end strategic opportunities? Do you think it’s critical for you to keep those skills in-house?
Arkadiy Dobkin: We’re always open for any type of partnership and opportunities to work with. As a company it would kind of complement our capabilities and allow us to grow to bigger programs. But there is no such an issues, we can talk about it and that’s been happening from time to time. At the same time, we strongly believe that we need to have some consultant capabilities really inside of the company to blend with our other services much, much tighter. 
Avishai Kantor: And my next question is regarding your plans to further diversify your global presence in delivery capabilities, any specific regions or countries that you’re focusing on at this point?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we have pretty well diversified number of locations right now. So clearly everybody is thinking about us as Eastern European, the center kind of become, but at the same time we have India, China and Mexico. At this point, we’re paying a lot of attention to make sure that we have well balanced delivery locations and focusing how to grow all of them because that’s practically a function of client demand and client who wanted us to have this locations and clients location in many cases and driving operations in all of this global places. 
Operator: Mr. Dobkin there are no further questions at this time. I’ll turn the floor back to you for any final comments. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you everybody for joining today. I would like to thank all of our employees for the good start of the year, and if you have any questions David is always available to address and talk to you in three months. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to EPAM Systems Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2017 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the conference over to your host, David Straube, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Sir.
David Straube: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the Company’s fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results. If you have not, a copy is available at epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today’s call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that some of the comments made on today’s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties as described in the Company’s earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP numbers have been reconciled to GAAP and are available in our fourth quarter earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We finished fiscal 2017 in a strong position with annual revenue of $1,450 million reflecting 25% year-over-year organic growth or 24% on constant currency terms. Our revenue growth was broad based both geographically and across the majority of our industry verticals. Additionally, we delivered strong non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.46, a growth of 19.3% and generated free cash flow of $166 million. In addition to finishing the fiscal year on the strong footing, we continue to evolve EPAM across three major pillars of our business. Our people, our capabilities and our key markets and customers. Combination of those is driving our differentiation, powered by our unique core engineering and digital business services strength. Let’s start from people, engagement and talent development. In 2017, we welcomed over 6,000 new employees to EPAM, hiring activity across most of our delivery centers in key end market locations. We attracted and highly skilled individuals to build multi-disciplinary hybrid teams, which is capable of solving the complexity associated with today’s business and technology challenges; and delivering solutions that help our clients to stay competitive in the fast-changing current environment, and be better prepared for tomorrow’s changes as well. We are making ongoing investments in our people function, employee engagement ecosystem as well as in advanced training and educational programs, engineering productivity tools and efficient delivery practices. We also ran over 500 events last year from [indiscernible] regional software engineering conferences to various specialized meet-ups, professional communities gatherings, numerous hackathons and innovative [events] [ph] across all EPAM locations. All that allows EPAM to continuously raise the bar to maintain our talent advantage in the marketplace. In 2017, over 4,000 students were enrolled in our university enrichment program, the largest group since we began this initiative almost 14 years ago. And we plan to develop that program further as well as start new educational initiative in the near future. To increase our access to talent, we continue to expand our geographic footprint in both established and new locations in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as in APAC and Latin America. The diversity of our geographic footprint gives EPAM, the flexibility to serve clients from over 25 countries spanning four continents across a number of deliveries scenarios. In result, we ended the quarter with over 22,900 delivery professionals, a 17% increase year-over-year and a net addition of more than 1,350 production professionals during Q4. Our total headcount ended at more than 25,900 employees. So, it goes without saying, our continuing focus on talent and ability to bring talent in ahead of demand is one of the most important success factors in maintaining our industry-leading organic growth rate. Capabilities and offerings; in fiscal 2017, we continue to invest broadly across our business adding more scale in our leadership team, more experience in our industry units and expanding service line offerings to support our current and future growth. In addition, we strengthened our partnership relationship with a number of strategic industry-leading and in some cases emerging technology providers to improve our capabilities in our core as well in [up and climbing] [ph] areas of interest. Last year, we continue to deliver against strong and increasing demand for digital business services and even stronger demand for digital platform and product engineering capabilities that EPAM has traditionally been recognized for. That demand pushed us to invest more and to bring to a new level such critical engineering capabilities as continuous delivery, continuous testing, advanced cloud deployment and [the works] [ph] to deliver high quality solutions clients expect us to deliver. Just to bring some color in here, I’d like to share that last week EPAM was included by InfoWorld into the group of tech companies leading in open source contributions by placing us as a number 14 on the list of Top 30, where we were surrounded by the most respectful global software and technology brands in the world. Worth to note that EPAM was the only one representative of large global software services firms on the list of leading open source contributors. Looking ahead, we are positioning EPAM to compete strongly in the increasing demand in market for disruptive technology services, specifically in artificial intelligence and intelligent automation area, as well as emerging blockchain implementation; services, which are going to spend the full spectrum of our capabilities from consulting, designing and engineering into operations. A reflection of that, EPAM continues to receive broad recognition across our service offerings. There are more than 32 industry innovation awards and recognitions in 2017. Last time, we shared with you story of expanded relationship and registered specific recognition in response to our contribution to innovative thinking in new type of solutions we are bringing for our client, Liberty Global. This time we would like to highlight another similar story. Working with UBS, one of our top clients, we created and delivery to solution around digital wealth management that is accessible to wide and diverse audience of their clients. In December, UBS and EPAM were voted the best use of IT private banking wealth management for Smart Wealth app as a banking technology award. This application is a great example of helping our customers, look at their business differently and to react quickly in a market in which both disruptions and opportunities are growing very fast. The Smart Wealth app is a testament to our ability to deliver on promise of innovation. Combined with our general wealth management expertise it becomes significant differentiating part of our offering to financial services clients today.  We very much value the opportunities to collaborate closely and innovation initiative as our client is delivering significant benefit to both of us.  Turning to markets and client highlights. As mentioned already, we are continuing to drive a number of strategic digital transformation programs for top existing as well as new clients. A few examples to share; we are currently working with European multinational corporation that specialized in industrial engineering and automation solution, spanning hardware software and services to digitize aspect of their core business and including product offerings, customer experience and partner ecosystem.  We are supporting this initiatives through the creation of digital factory center of excellence that allows the highly adaptable EPAM led team to understand and respond to the quickly changes needs of the business. This approach gives our clients quick access to our best-in-class technology skills and provides approaches for a quick response and reliable execution on digital initiatives.  Another example is enterprise digital transformation initiative we just started with Global Health Services Company which provide health care product and other related services to people in over 30 countries. We are helping them across a range of key priorities [digitization] [ph] data analytics, legacy modernization and aspects of consumer engagement where we are applying service design principles and ramification scenarios to improve outcomes.  Most of these engagements started just less than 12 months ago, but we expect them to become a part of our Top 20-30 accounts in 2018.  Let’s take a look at our vertical performance in the fourth quarter. Financial services, our largest vertical finished the quarter with 31% growth year-over-year, which was broad based across our major geographies and driven by client responding to high end product development offering, digitalization and payment optimization, and consumer grew 24% for the quarter with demand coming from digital transformation projects including customer experience and personalization, the effort as well as the data even inside program.  Software and Hi-Tech grew 18% year-over-year for the quarter with growth coming from a combination of startup and life software and technology companies focus on project development and digital transformation.  Media and entertainment posted 39% growth year over year driven by engagement in digital services for clients and publish information services and broadcasters. Life Sciences and Healthcare grew only 6% over the same quarter last year. While we’re progressing over the last couple years it’s still truly our smaller segment and the most impacted by some changes just in fewer clients. Growth last quarter was influenced by the planned run down and conclusion of a few large engagements with existing customers. At the same time, we are very confident that Life Science and Healthcare represent significant opportunity for EPAM and you really return to my tribe growth trajectory throughout fiscal 2018.  And lastly, our emerging verticals delivery and another strong quarter is growth or 57% driven primarily by healthcare energy and now also by automotive clients. Their growth is triggered by our mainstream digital capabilities, but also by several new engagements. In regards to customer concentration and opportunities across our client base, year over year growth within our top 20 accounts was more than 18%, while growth outside of the top 20 accounts was 34%. To understand our client diversity better, it would be important to know that among our top hundred clients which it is what starts at about 4 million in annual revenue, practically 50% are part of the global portion to sales and obviously great for us a significant opportunity to grow all these infatuate. One last note, this year we will celebrate the 25th anniversary of EPAM. We are proud to enter into 2018 with 25% organic annual growth. And we feel very fortunate to be able to rely on our 25,000-strong client base each capable to deliver top-notch solutions across 25 countries worldwide. We are very happy to contribute to communities across those countries with our extended social responsibility programs including such is relevant to our conversation today as EPAM, ET program. The program is constantly improving Pfizer in cooperation with my team and thus create program and initiative in each class now 14 countries globally and represent our very strong commitment to developing engineering talent for tomorrow. Let me turn it over to Jason for a detailed financial update.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark and good morning, everyone. I’ll start with some financial highlights. Talk about profitability, cash flow and on guidance for fiscal 2018 in Q1. In Q4, we delivered continued strong top line performance through non-GAAP earnings per share and generated significant free cash flow.  There are a few key highlights from this quarter, revenue close to $399.3 million reflecting a 27.4% year over year reported organic growth rate or 23.8% growth in constant currency terms, sequentially our Q4 growth rate was 5.8%. From a geographic perspective, North America our largest region representing 56.9% of our Q4 revenues move 22.5% year over year. Europe representing 35.1% of our Q4 revenues grew 29.7% year-over-year or 22.5% in constant currency. CIS assets representing 5.8% of our Q4 revenues grew 73.8% year over year or 64.6% in constant currency. And finally, APAC grew 31.5% or 27.3% in constant currency and now represents 2.2% of our revenues. Moving now to income statement, our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 36.4% compared to 36.8% percent in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 38% compared to 38.1% for the same quarter last year. GAAP SG&A was 21.2% of revenue compared to 22.8% in Q4 last year and non-GAAP SG&A came in at 19.6% of revenue compared to 20.2% in the same period last year. Our current level of SG&A reflects our continued investment in talent acquisition, extension of our global footprint and expansion of capabilities with a focus on supporting our long term sustainable growth strategy. GAAP income from operations was 52.1 million or 13% of revenue in the quarter compared to 37.4 million or 11.9% of revenue in Q4 last year. Non-GAAP income from operations with 66.9 million or 16.8% of revenue in the quarter compared to 51.5 million or 16.4% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 159.3%, which includes the impact of the recently passed Tax Reform Legislation. Non-GAAP effective tax rate was 17.6% which excludes the impact of tax reform legislation. Both our GAAP and Non-GAAP tax rates reflect a change in the geographic mix of income and the implementation of certain tax planning initiatives. Diluted earnings per share on GAAP basis was negative $0.58 which includes a 74.6 million onetime charge, resulting from tax form legislation. Excluding the charge related to this legislation GAAP EPS was $0.78, which included a lower tax rate, offset by higher foreign change losses and stock compensation expense. Non-GAAP EPS, which excludes the onetime impact of tax reform legislation and other adjustments was $1.01 reflecting a 31% increase over the same quarter in fiscal year ‘16. In Q4, they were approximately 52.9 million GAAP diluted shares outstanding. Utilization was 78.8% compared to 75.9% in the same period last year and 77.6% last quarter. We landed slightly over the top end of the 75% to 77% percent range, we’d like to manage to a higher than historical levels. But we continue to hire for the demand within our business. We do expect that utilization will trend more towards the top end of our traditional range of 75% to 77% over the medium term. Turning our cash flow and balance sheet, cash from operations for Q4 was $71.4 million compared to $53.7 million in the same quarter last year. Free cash flow came in at $58.5 million compared to $44.3 million in the same quarter last year, resulting in a 103% conversion of adjusted net income. Total DSO was 81 days compared to 77 days in the same quarter last year. We continue to be quite pleased with our total DSO performance in the low 80s. Now let me see how we finished the fiscal year across a number of financial metrics. Revenues for the fiscal year closed at $1.45 billion or 25% growth over 2016, which represents an organic constant currency growth of 23.9%. Underscoring the relevance of our offerings in the market. GAAP income from operations increased 29.4% year over year and represented 11.9% of revenue for the year. Our non-GAAP income from operations increased 22.3% over the prior year to 234.7 million and represented 16.2% of revenue. GAAP effective tax rate for the year came in at 58.3% which includes the impact of the recently passed tax reform legislation, excluding the impact of this legislation and other adjustments our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 20.5%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.32 which includes a 74.6 million onetime charge resulting from tax reform legislation. The onetime Tax Reform item was included in this year’s GAAP EPS results were 64.3 million in provisional transitional tax and 10.3 million provisional charge due to a write down deferred tax assets. Non-GAAP EPS which excludes the one impact of tax reform legislation and other adjustments with $3.46 reflecting a 19.3% increase over fiscal ‘16. In fiscal 2017 there were approximately 55 million diluted shares outstanding. Cash from operations was 195.4 million compared to 164.8 million for fiscal 2016. And free cash flow came in at $165.6 million or 87% adjusted net income conversion. Turning now to guidance starting with fiscal 2018 revenue growth will be at least 24% reported or at least 22% in constant currency after factoring in 2% estimated currency tailwinds. We expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 12% to 13% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16% to 17% percent. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 15% and a non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 22%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $3.38 for the full year and non-GAAP EPS will be at least $4.03 for the full year. We expect weighted average share count of 57.3 million fully delivered shares outstanding. For Q1 of fiscal year ‘18, revenues will be at least 414 million for the first quarter reflecting a growth rate of at least 27% reported or at least 23% in constant currency after factoring 4% estimated currency tailwinds. For the first quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 15% to 16% which reflects the normal seasonality we expect in Q1. We expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 11% and non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 22%. As we review our tax structure, we think that could be a few discreet onetime tax benefits that will impact our Q1 tax rate. Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $0.76 for the quarter and non-GAAP EPS will be at least $0.90 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 56.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And finally, a few key assumptions which support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock compensation expense is expected to be around 55.2 million with 13.5 million in Q1 and approximately 13 million to 14 million in each remaining quarter. Amortization and intangibles will be around 6.4 million for the year, evenly spread across each quarter. Foreign exchange is expected to produce a $6.4 million loss for the year with approximately 1.9 million loss in Q1 and 1.5 million loss in each remaining quarter. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around 15 million for the year with 3.7 million in Q1 and approximately 3.8 million in each remaining quarter. Lastly, we expect excess tax benefits of around 15.9 million for the full year with approximately 5.2 million in Q1. Our 2018 outlook reflects continued strong demand for services, underpinned by the diverse set of industries we serve which will produce varying growth opportunities as they go through their natural cycles. We remain confident that our strategy of combining core engineering heritage with advanced technology and digital business services positions EPAM well for the future. With that let’s open the call up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instruction] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Darrin Peller: All right, thanks guys. Nice job. Just want to start off with the overall environment. Ark look, I mean obviously in the backdrop of tax reform macro we’re hearing some positive sentiment from some competitors of yours as well as from the end market. I mean have you seen any inflection in terms of client discussions, in terms of [indiscernible] spent in certain areas that maybe weren’t there as much last year or, I mean clearly, well I just wanted to know if there are certain areas it may have accelerated or not?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, you know it’s very difficult to [indiscernible] micro kind of changes. It still seems like for us, in line with what we’ve seen before maybe in 6 or 12 months from now we’ll be able to evaluate it better. But right now I think we’re having similar environments that you had before.
Darrin Peller: Okay. And then just let me go into more specifics on financials. Just one question is on margins and free cash. I mean you guys have historically been pretty steady with your margin plans to reinvest in the business and maintain that. Just curious though it’s high level again, just given the growth are there - assuming you wanted to change your investment levels, I guess giving [indiscernible] profile I guess how much room would you consider discretionary on the margin. We’re getting this question from clients because you’re growing so well, right now. If growth would ever slow down would you be able to turn on the margin switch if you needed to? Just curious your high level strategic thoughts on the margin again, if you’re just planning on keeping it roughly flat for the next couple of years [indiscernible]?
Jason Peterson: Certainly, we continue to see strong growth in the market and expect to continue to deliver greater than 20% annual revenue growth. And so, as long as those conditions exist I think you can look at the profitability that we’re delivering in this - in the guide for obviously 2018, is in the 16% to 17% range.  Certainly, where we operate in 2018, we visit it over time if growth rates ever change. But right now, continue to invest in the business. And in 2018 expect to deliver between 16% and 17% adjusted IFO.
Darrin Peller: Okay. All right, just last one quickly on the organic versus inorganic assumptions that was in fourth quarter embedded in the outlook? And then I will turn back to queue. Thanks guys.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yeah. So, it was all organic right now. 
Jason Peterson: And the guidance that we have for 2018 also is organic. So, if we were to announce anything in the future it would [indiscernible]. 
Darrin Peller: Excellent. Thanks guys.
Operator: [Operator Instruction] The next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies. Please ask your question.
Ramsey El-Assal: I had a question about DevOps and sort of continuous development methodologies which you mentioned briefly. Did these give you a competitive advantage or do they reduce internal development costs? How is this, how will you your use of DevOps sort of benefit you in the marketplace?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So definitely impacting engineering productivity and predictability of quality of delivering solutions. And we talked pretty regularly about our kind of [indiscernible] experience to build professional software products and this is one of the components which allow us to differentiate ourselves. So, it’s a pure differentiation of quality of final deliverables. And with this new kind of growing complexity of the digital solutions, it’s a very important component of being on target.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Hey guys, good quarter there. My question is on your headcount expectations, obviously you know that 24% growth, 200 basis points from FX in there. Jason you mentioned higher utilization, so that gave you some help. But you kind of ended the year at 17% headcount growth, are you going to accelerate your headcount, hiring plan or is there a pricing component in there, could you talk about that?
Jason Peterson: Thanks. Yeah. So, you know we continue to see strong demand and so we clearly are hiring for that demand. What we have sort of talked about is that, we are running a pretty high utilization at this point and I think 78.8% for Q4 and talked about that utilization level coming down slightly over time. So yeah that would reflect the fact that we do intend to be doing some additional hiring to support our revenue growth. One of the benefits of running a slightly lower utilization level is it does give you more opportunity to support upticks in demand. And so, the upside to that is that, you got some additional sourcing available for unexpected customer demand. But generally, the slightly lower utilization does have some impact on gross margins and that part of what drove the guidance for Q1.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: But is the level of pricing -- is the level of demand [indiscernible] I guess?
Jason Peterson: So, from a pricing standpoint I think that we’ve got - we have opportunities in pricing in part because of the demand and a scarcity of resources in the marketplace. And as we talked in the past we do get annual increases across a significant subset of our top customers. So, there are some opportunities from a pricing standpoint if you - sort of talking about gross margin more broadly. Programs like Ark talked about in terms of like university program that brings you know additional levels of [indiscernible] resources into the company also helps from a pyramid standpoint and are supportive of gross margin kind of management and improvement.
Operator: Our next question from the line of Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Maggie Nolan: Hi guys. Just building on that previous question, can you talk a little bit about your ability to move employees across engagements or geographies as demand ebbs and flows?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, I think it’s kind of a regular process with optimization of the teams and finding the best opportunities where we can utilize that talent. So, when necessary, there is definitely a rotation of the projects and there is some rotation or some movement to [indiscernible] geographies but it’s pretty minor in our environment. So basically, we optimize in team composition and again internal project rotations that’s part of our model. Moving people from one geography to another, it’s more on exceptional basis.
Maggie Nolan: Thanks. Congrats on the results.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Lou Miscioscia with Pivotal Research. Please proceed with you question.
Louis Miscioscia: Thank you. Just first a clarification I think consensus for EPS for 2018 is around $4.17. Obviously in the press release you’ve given guidance that’s below that. Would you say that your guidance is just being conservative or maybe just an explanation of why EPS is not growing as fast as revenue? And then I have a follow up if possible.
Jason Peterson: I think what we’re guiding to is profitability remaining reasonably consistent. What we think that we’ll see is - we’ve talked about is utilization declining slightly, at the same time we think that we will see some greater efficiency in SG&A. And what you refer to as SG&A leverage.  So, we’re comfortable with being able to deliver 16% to 17% adjusted IFO, while growing the business rapidly and giving ourselves the opportunity to support increments in demand.
Louis Miscioscia: Okay, then tighten to the follow up question, when you look at utilization, a lot of other IT service companies maybe ones that are bigger than you, a few years ago had utilization levels at the same level that you had and basically, they switch things around and just actually start to get utilization more into the 80s. So, is there any chance to rethink that? And not exactly sure how operationally to do it but, others have. So just wondering if the goal should be higher there? Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we have for our environment for our size and for the type of services which we provide and we have optimal goal at least that’s our opinion right now. It’s very difficult to compare these larger vendors especially not only because of the size, but because of the portfolio of services they provide into.
Jason Peterson: But it’s something that we do revisit overtime and there’s always this balance between making certain that you’ve got resources available to support sort of upticks in demand And then of course not having - not kind of over-hiring. So, there’s a fine balance there.
Louis Miscioscia: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Moshe Khatri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. 
Moshe Khatri: Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on strong results. Couple of questions, CIS was up a lot sequentially and year of the year. Maybe you can talk a bit about that, whereas the sources of the strength that’s coming from that specific region? Is that sustainable? And then the other question is going to be related to expectations for wage inflation that’s embedded in the model for 2018? Thanks a lot.
Jason Peterson: Sure. On the CIS front, I just kind of several things. So, while we had a strong movable between obviously Q4 of ‘16 and Q4 ‘17, just got appreciation sort of and increases in revenue growth by foreign exchange. The other thing that was we actually had some timing of revenue recognition in Q4 for two financial services clients, who had sort of an uptick in revenue that in part was due to sort of timing of revenue recognition, so extremely high-level growth that we saw in CIS countries between Q4 ‘16 and ‘17 is not what I would expect on the go forward basis, but at the same time we still see good revenue growth there and continues to be a nice piece of our business.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And when you’re looking at facts which is complement, it it’s still a reflection of a stronger economy in comparison with couple years ago because oil prices went up so basically kind of went up more business layer as well.
Moshe Khatri: So, wage inflation assumptions for 2018?
Jason Peterson: So clearly, it’s something that we’re were regularly monitoring. I would say that the wage inflation is still what I would call relatively modest. There may have been a little bit of an uptick in 2017 but we feel that it’s something that we’re able to manage. And again, if I think about gross margin, it’s got multiple components. One is the ability to price which we talked about in the earlier - one of the earlier questions. And we do see some opportunities from pricing standpoint as the ability to manage the pyramid and Ark talked about that and his opening response where we’re bringing in additional university students and also sort of a customer mix. And so, we feel comfortable with our ability to continue to manage.
Moshe Khatri: So, are we still on that 6% to 7% level in terms of wage inflation 40,000?
Jason Peterson: I wouldn’t say any higher than that. So yeah. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Avishai Kantor with Cowen & Company. Please go with your question. 
Avishai Kantor: Hi and thank you for taking my question. You mentioned strength in the automotive segment. I was wondering if you can elaborate on that where is it coming from? Are you gaining share, which regions are you adding new client?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, we mention this because it’s part of our kind of as other emergence verticals right now. So, we didn’t have much business in this segment probably 24 months ago. Now it is a growing, and this is mostly Europe and Asia.
Jason Peterson: So, it’s still a modest number, but it’s our new revenue stream for us and it is growing.
Avishai Kantor: Do you think you’re getting market share from other vendors there?
Arkadiy Dobkin: When you grow and it’s always taken share from other vendors, but again it’s relatively insignificant right now. Probably it would be better to talk like in 12 months or even late to understand.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Mayank Tandon: Thank you. Good morning Ark could you drill into a little bit more on the drivers and some of the key verticals like banking, financial services and healthcare. Especially in banking we’ve been hearing obviously mixed signals. The banks are investing in digital, but they’re also condensing their spend on some of the legacy’s and how that’s impacting you in that verticals? And of course, what the drivers are in financial services broadly? And of course, in the key Healthcare segment as well? Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it is a pretty simple answer because like in financial services it all of us was very EGK specifically on workers and a lot of big systems which were supposed to be have to be supported there. So, we all of us when we were talking about our line of services weren’t it was a legacy component or some kind of traditional maintenance component. It is pretty small. And right now for example, and we talked today about it, all year delivering mostly on digital side so the type of new engagement systems for financial services like wealth management is a good example of this and this was one of our good business. So, it’s mostly a growing area for us even today.
Jason Peterson: And so, again our growth relative to maybe some of the others in the market as Ark said, we got substantial growth in wealth and asset management both with existing and new customers. So very much the kind of digital transformation and we have very limited exposure to what you would call the traditional sort of keep the lights on business which maybe is a more challenging kind of stream. So that said our legacy is never been a significant part of our revenue stream.
Mayank Tandon: And on healthcare any drivers that you could call out there that are maybe fueling spending there or you know how we should look at that segment in terms of overall spend levels because as your other verticals?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I also mentioned already today that we do believe that it’s a very strong article and we have big opportunity there. While it’s still smaller for us and volatility is much bigger than other segments, like couple accounts, couple engagements could actually impact quarterly results. So, what we are very optimistic on this one. And we’ve seen a lot of opportunities in business for us.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Kupferberg: Hey good morning guys. Another good year. I just want to ask question actually about the share count forecast for 2018. It looks like share count is going to be growing a little faster in ‘18 than in ‘17 if that’s just a function of how the stock has performed or other factors? And as part of that any thoughts I’m possibly using some share buyback to soak up some of the ongoing creep. I mean, I think this is one of the big deltas between what the street may have been forecasting for EPS and what the guidance looks like? And if you can tie that in just with some broader balance sheet deployment comments, I think you’re at almost 600 million in cash now. So, I would love to hear your latest thoughts there? Thanks. 
Jason Peterson: Yeah. So that’s fair. Continue to use some stock as an element of our compensation and retention, but I don’t think you really see any significant change there in our guidance in 2019 which may be seeing is that as our share price appreciates you know that does have an impact on the fully diluted shares and that calculation. So maybe that’s kind of what we’re showing up from a couple allocation standpoint. We’re going to continue to do is to focus our cash on inorganic strategy and you know we are active and I think you’ll see us be more active in 2018. So, I think for the most part that’s where you will see cash deployed. There isn’t a plan right now to begin using the cash for buybacks, but it’s certainly - we are revisiting our capital allocation strategy. And I things could change overtime but clearly in the coming year we’re very focused on our organic strategy.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Joseph Forrester with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.
Joseph Forrester: Hi. I was wondering if you could talk about the size of contracts. Are they getting bigger and are there any large projects that you’re working on just given the growth?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Definitely is a decisive engagement is growing. So, while we still have we still have kind of like approach where we sometimes starting from a relatively small engagement and then getting in different areas. You can see it also from rate of growth and the level of the rate of kind of concentration of our clients. But it’s definitely bigger and bigger deals we participate in right now. 
Jason Peterson: And at the same time, we continue to be highly diverse range of customers. So as Ark said, we’re you know we’re growing our engagements with large customers which is a significant source of our growth. But we continue to be very diversified across our customer base and very diversified across the industries we work in.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think is unhealthy. We use it to do this to clients to be sure we work in less than 12 months. But the speed of growth will bring them probably to 20 or so to top the counts for us in 2018.
Joseph Forrester: Got it. And then just financial services, are you expecting any acceleration in spending now that the tax bill has gone through and your clients have a little bit more money? And maybe you can give us a little bit of an update on UBS? Thanks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, as I mentioned already we rather watch what’s happening and we’ll try to predict the market. So, I think again while are growing fast we are still a relatively small player in this in this segment and I don’t think it’s impacting us one way or another significantly. So, on UBS we gave some color on what program on what program we are on and how successful there. And as we mentioned last time, it is stable account for us right now and we have on line with expectations which we had.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of James Freedman with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.
James Freedman: Thank you and congratulations on your 25, its Jamie from Susquehanna. I want to ask about the median enter team and observations. Do you anticipate that vertical still expected to grow faster than the company average going forward? And if you wouldn’t mind sharing some use cases I know you did that the Analyst Day last year about what’s resonating in media and entertainment?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Well during the last call, we were talking about Liberty Global and how we grow in these diverse programs. But with a lot of new things happening there how we felt on innovation side of the business as well. So that would be true for both accounts in this in this segment. I don’t think it would be growing fast growing right now, but it probably will be above company grows for some time.
James Freedman: Thanks Ark. And then maybe the same on Life Science and healthcare, it look like it decelerated a bit but any color that you might have there would be helpful?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Difficult to listen to what I mentioned already and or kind of answer in as well, so it’s still small sector for us. We have some two account which we finished some programs, but we do believe that it would go back and probably will be growing at least through speed or the rest of the company in the next 12 to 18 months.
James Freedman: Got it. Thanks for the perspective.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Vladimir Bespalov with VTB Capital. Please proceed with you question.
Vladimir Bespalov: Hello. Congratulations on the number. Thank you for taking my question. Like a couple of very brief questions. First on the substance for growth in constant currency versus growth, at all what assumptions do you use for a year versus other key currencies? Then the second question is on the margin guidance, your non-GAAP operating margin guidance for 2019, the range is narrowed compared to what you guy did before 16% to 18%. So, what is this like competitive pressure or just a trade-off between growth and stability and things like this? Could you provide some color on that? And the last thing, could you educate me a little bit on this effect of U.S. tax reform on your GAAP earnings and does it affect the cash flow at all?
Jason Peterson: Sure, it’s always from a foreign exchange assumptions for the most part, what we used for development of our guidance was partly from probably early, and so rather than trying to sort of forecast rates or what the impact might be in the future you would generally use kind of spot rates and of course we’ve seen strong or Euro and Pound and Ruble appreciation between 2016 and 2017 and early 2018. And in part that’s what you see driving that or we feel would tailwind foreign exchange. From the standpoint of the profitability range, when we got to the second half of 2017 we did narrow range of 16% to 17%. And so, this is not really a change from that. And I think what it just kind of reflects is where we think we’ll operate inside of 2018 and so we’re not guiding to what we think could happen in 2019, but just it’s a reflection of where we think we’ll operate as we continue to drive you know high top line growth. So finally, from the standpoint of I guess the tax reform you know we looked at obviously a significant entry in Q4 that’s not - that doesn’t impact the cash flow. Again, we will need to effectively make payments over a year time period. With their early years the 8% of that total and then it gets higher overtime particularly in the last three years. And so, I don’t think you’ll see a significant impact on cash flow for us. The only thing is that you know it does give you more flexibility now to sort of money that we have in various non-U.S. sort of geographies and we’ll be sort of revisiting that and that gives us some of that money back into the U.S. and Western Europe to support our inorganic strategy.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arvind Ramnani with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Arvind Ramnani: Hey first of all congrats on a great quarter and good guidance. I have a broader question about 12 to 18 months back you expanded and refreshed your management team. Can you comment on what you have done with the sales organization? And also, you know are you doing anything different on partnerships and alliances side?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Like you wish us for over six years carefully. So, there is always something changing in the management and in respect of our 24 feet. And you mentioned this question about sales was a favorite for a long time. And we do believe that we have great opportunities in our client base and we’ve target in sales actually how to penetrate this, while again about 10% of business came in from new loggers today. So, I don’t know how in couple sentences to actually answer, but there are definitely improvements in this area and a lot of us came in and growth supported while we were like four times bigger than we were six years ago or something like that. So, I don’t know what else to say.
Jason Peterson: I think from my perspective as one of the new entrants you know is that we continue to grow with the right customers who work with us and add one account or move to another job and then oftentimes they bring which I think is both high praise and also a great source of our growth.
Arvind Ramnani: Yeah, when I’m I’ve done checks on your feedback is always very positive. Clients are really happy about kind of the work that EPAM does. You know certainly like enthusiastic at client base. I was just wondering you know are you still expanding the sales team or are kind of this sales model that has worked so well for so many years is that kind of staying consistent?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Let me answer differently, I think the sales model to deliver good quality services is the best sales model. We definitely extended in the number of people in business development function, but I think it’s actually driven by the quality of delivery and reputation is probably the most reliable. So, to be fair then it’s my job for our business development people too. So, we’re focusing on quality, we’re focusing on the capabilities this is number one.
Arvind Ramnani: Great. Thank you very much and wish you the best for 2018.
Operator: The next question comes from the Louis Miscioscia with Pivotal Research. Please proceed with your question.
Louis Miscioscia: This is your question for our follow up. So obviously we were hearing a lot about block chain automation robotic process automation AI. If you could just maybe comment is what you’re really seeing out there in the sense of a lot of your clients engaging with you with these new types of technologies. Or is it real just still very embryonic and not really kicking into high gear yet in a meaningful portion of revenue? Thank you. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: What we’re seeing in the market right now that anything related to automation is becoming very very hard. And there are a lot of companies being in on this very seriously and this type of engagements are starting to show up all over the place. So, I think it’s interesting they really didn’t prove probably completely return on investment, but there are a lot of companies here. With Blockchain, is still probably much more in the beginning a lot of hopes, but initial experimentation and yeah. 
Louis Miscioscia: Thank you. Good luck for another new year. 
Operator: Our final question this morning comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
David Grossman: Thank you. So, I just wanted to go back to something I came up earlier about utilization and I thought I’d heard you talk about running at the higher end of the target range even though it’s coming down you’re still going to run at the higher end of your target. And if that’s right is that a management decision to run at the high end of the range or is it reflecting type supply? And how should we think about diversification in your supply base over the next few years including perhaps set up and know kind of what’s going on in India with these subsidiaries there?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. We were running this higher than before because probably the scale of the company improved and we’re trying to understand what actually optimal and what’s possible from this point of view. So, we will see that we can and we kind of talked about that result - it would be possible to increase we definitely will increase. But we are not going to do it in the exchange of the quality of delivery or preparedness of our teams to do that type of work in it. And so, our best efforts would be to keep it higher than before I came on the situation of the workforce. We also mentioned during the last couple years that like four, five years ago we didn’t have any iteration so in delivery centers outside of Eastern Europe. We’re investing a lot right now in India. We investing in China, we have a center in Mexico right now. So, diversification is happening.  Proportion of resources like five six years ago as Bellerose was by far the biggest, now is very, very different. And this is a big increase in Central Europe between well and in Hungary right now as well. So, if the situation is happening all the time we continuously see and would what could be done better in this area.
Operator: Thank you. I would like to turn the floor back to management for closing remark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you and we are pleased with our results in 2017. The core of our growth continue to be defined by our ability to deliver the complex programs. So as we mentioned the focus on the quality of our capabilities and that should drive everything else. This year I would like thank to all our 25,000 people globally for helping to make happening what’s happening right now. And thank you for today’s call and talk to you in three months. Thank you.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the EPAM Q3 2017 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. David Straube, Investor Relations for EPAM.  Thank you, Mr. Straube. You may begin.
David Straube: Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the Company's third quarter fiscal 2017 results. If you have not, a copy is available at epam.com in the Investors section.  With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties as described in the Company's earnings release and SEC filings.  Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP numbers have been reconciled to GAAP and are available in our third quarter earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website.  With that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our third quarter revenue results reflect continued high demand for our services across both the industries we serve and the geographies in which we operate.  We also delivered a strong profitability in the quarter and generated significant free cash flow. Revenue for Q3 came in at $378 million, representing year-over-year organic growth of 26.6% reported or 24.6% in constant currency. Across all verticals, the trends of transformation, digitalization, and competitive disruption in our clients and markets are main drivers for our growth.  Financial Services, our largest vertical, finished the quarter with 15% growth, which was broad based across our major geographies and driven by clients responding to regulatory changes, digitalization and the drive to optimize payments.  Excluding the impact of UBS, Financial Services grew 27% in Q3. Travel & Consumer grew 20% in the quarter with growth coming from the continued focus on ecommerce, customer experience and personalization efforts among clients in North America and Europe.  Software and Hi-Tech grew 22% for the quarter, driven by diversified portfolio of mature software companies emerging start-ups technology companies growing through digital platform transformations.  Media & Entertainment was 42% growth in the quarter. The continued evolution of direct-to-consumer trends, which include enrichment review and end and user experience across multiple platforms help drive growth in this vertical.  Life Science and Healthcare grew 24% over the same quarter last year. Trends driving the growth this quarter were Life Science clients focus on the new ways to engage with doctors and patients, in addition to having GIT initiatives. And lastly, our emerging verticals delivered yet another strong quarter with growth of 78%, driven primarily by telecommunications and energy clients. The diversification across our clients continues to progress, with growth outside of the top 20 accounts coming in at 37% and growth in the top 20 accounts at just over 15% or more than 20% excluding the effect of UBS. As usual, growth this quarter came from combination of existing and new clients.  We ended this quarter with over 21,680 professionals, an increase of over 13% year-over-year bringing our total employee headcount to more than 24,500. Net addition of more than 1,200 production professionals during Q3 is a level we have not seen in six quarters. Taking a bit away from numbers, I would like to bring just one customer story, we should illustrate well the journey we are experiencing today with some of our key clients. The journey, which is very much in line with what we shared during our Investor Day in regards to unique relationships among coupon service horizons, which include core engineering services to make sure we build things right, complex solution design and delivery to improve our clients systems of engagement and innovative creative thinking and experimentation with new technologies and business models to predict how those critical solutions might look like for our customers tomorrow.  And what is important is the ability to materialize, bring to the market those solutions sooner than most of our competitors can due to our core engineering advantage or in short, make those solutions real. We do believe the right complement in balance of vapors across those horizons differentiate EPAM on the market today.  So back to the story. Liberty Global is one of the largest cable companies in the world. We started to work with Liberty over five years ago and it was one of our first digital strategy engagements which brought us and innovation at what as their technology standard breaks down.  Nothing unusual is it. What is more unusual that during the past years, EPAM received at Liberty Global Technology Summits another three awards in the innovation and breakthrough illumination. For example, this year we are focused on the EPAM augmented reality hologram solution for formula e-racing which allows users to watch multiple race scanners at one time and also see the circuit with the current position of the driver.  And just last week, Liberty Global was named as the winner of the Best Wireless Broadband Solution at the Broadband World Forum awards for their new Connect Up, which EPAM team helped to develop and was honored to be invited to the stage together with our client to accept the award. That allows user to check them our well usage monitor devices, devices connected to their home Wi-Fi network and automatically connect to about ten million Wi-Fi hotspots internationally. What is interesting that during those five years, in addition of those innovation awards, Liberty became for us one of the top clients we just confirmed that we are bringing balanced value across all three horizons and driving that value from the innovation angle to real tangible results to the client.  With that, I think it would be appropriate to share a news about another relevant recognition for our digital capabilities. Last month, EPAM was ranked for the second year in a row, the UK-Top 100 Digital Agencies. Region ranked number five agency in UK  And lastly, in Q3, we held our Annual Software Engineering Conference that brings together Epamers from around the world, from engineers to designers to data scientist and functional leaders. This year a large group of clients joined us for the first time to share from one side and to hear from another the latest trends in technology and engineering and how those three revenue business models can bring new value.  This is as a global event that helps us to develop our talent and forge stronger relationship with our customers. It’s just another components which illustrates how important for us to maintain our engineering DNA, which is a key goal across all services of our business.  So with that, let me hand the call over to Jason for additional details on the quarter.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. As Ark mentioned, we delivered strong top-line performance, drove higher profitability and generated significant free cash flow in the third quarter. Let me start with some financial highlights, talk about profitability, cash flow and end on guidance.  Getting with revenue, on a reported basis, we closed the third quarter with $377.5 million, 26.6% growth over the same quarter last year and 8.2% growth sequentially. Year-over-year, constant currency growth was 24.6%, reflecting a currency benefit of 2%. Actual revenues, compared to our Q2 guidance, benefited from a combination of stronger revenue production of $8.2 million and a favorable currency impact of $2.3 million.  From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region, representing 57.8% of our Q3 revenues, grew 28.4% year-over-year and 27.6% in constant currency. Europe, representing 35.9% of our Q3 revenue, grew 22.8% year-over-year and 19.8% in constant currency. Absent the effect of UBS, growth in Europe was 26.4% in constant currency.  CIS grew 44.6% year-over-year, with 34.7% in constant currency and now represents 4.2% of our revenue. And lastly APAC grew 12.6% year-over-year and 12.2% in constant currency and now represents 2.1% of our revenue. Moving down the income statement, our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 36.6%, compared to 36% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 37.9%, compared to 37.6% for the same quarter last year. The 30 basis point year-over-year increase in non-GAAP gross margin resulted from the higher utilization offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange.  GAAP SG&A was 21.5% of revenue, compared to 22.6% in Q3 of last year and non-GAAP SG&A, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and certain other items came in at 19.8%, compared to 19.5% in the same period last year. Our level of SG&A reflects the continued investment in our talent acquisition, extension of our global footprint and expansion of our capabilities with a focus on supporting our long-term sustainable growth strategy. GAAP income from operations was $49.2 million, compared to $33.9 million in Q3 last year, representing 13% of revenue in the quarter.  Non-GAAP income from operations was $62.6 million, compared to $49.7 million in Q3 last year, representing 16.6% of revenue. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 15.7% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 20.4%. For the quarter, we generated $0.77 of GAAP EPS. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.92, a 21.1% increase when compared with non-GAAP EPS of $0.76 in the third quarter of last year. Total shares outstanding for Q3 were approximately 55.2 million. Utilization was 77.6%, compared to 72% in the same quarter last year and 79.6% last quarter. We will end up slightly over-the-top end of the 75% to 77% range we like to manage to and higher than our Q3 historical levels. We will continue to hire for the demand we see in our business with an expectation that utilization will trend more towards our traditional range of 75% to 77% over the medium-term.  Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash from operations for Q3 was $64.9 million, compared to $61.8 million in the same quarter last year. Free cash flow came in at $59.4 million, compared to $55.4 million in Q3 of last year resulting in a 116% conversion of adjusted net income.  Total DSO was 82 days, compared to 83 days in the same quarter last year. We continue to be pleased with our total DSO performance in the low 80s.  Turning now to guidance, starting with fiscal 2017, revenue growth will now be at least 24% and we expect constant currency growth will continue to be at least 23%. For the full year, we now expect the impact of foreign exchange would be a positive 1%.  We expect GAAP income from operations will continue to be in the range of 12% to 13% and non-GAAP income from operations will continue to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate will continue to be approximately 16% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate will now be approximately 21%.  For the full year, earnings per share, we now expect GAAP diluted EPS to be at least $2.68 and non-GAAP EPS will now be at least $3.41, substantially driven by stronger revenue performance in fiscal 2017. We now expect weighted average share count of $54.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For Q4, revenues will be at least $395 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting a growth rate of at least 26% after 3% currency tailwinds, meaning we expect constant currency growth will be at least 23%.  For the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13% to 14% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate will be approximately 17% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate will be approximately 20%.  Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $0.78 and non-GAAP EPS to be at least $0.96 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 55.8 million fully diluted shares outstanding.  Few key assumptions with support our GAAP-to-non-GAAP measurements in the fourth quarter. Stock compensation expense is now expected to be approximately $11.4 million. Amortization of purchased intangibles is now expected to be approximately $1.8 million.  Foreign exchange losses are now expected to be approximately $1.5 million. Tax-effective non-GAAP adjustment is now expected to be approximately $2 million.  Lastly, with recent adoption of ASU 2016-09, as a result of movement in our stock price, we continue to expect future volatility in our effective tax rate and GAAP EPS. In Q4, we expect excess tax benefit of approximately $2.3 million.  Thank you. And now let me turn the call back to David.
David Straube: Thanks, Jason. To allow as many participants as possible on today’s call, I would request that each of you ask one question and a follow-up. Operator, would you please provide instructions for those on the call?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Darrin Peller: Hey guys. Nice chat on the quarter. Let me just start off with the talent – ability to acquire talent for you guys. I mean, it's obviously becoming a much more competitive space overall around digital. And you've done well there. I just want to hear a little bit more about how – what type of supply there is for talent? If it’s changed in terms of the dynamics from a competitive standpoint?  And then, maybe just follow-up to that on pricing, obviously, the prices you are paying for this talent probably is higher, if you could talk to a little bit about the pricing environment, if you could pass that through? Anything is changing on that front? Just a quick update there. Thanks. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: You probably remember that each time we answering this question our reply is pretty consistent. It's never was easy and it's not easy too right now and probably would be even more challenging in the future. So, and with each kind of stage in our development and growth, we are finding it very hard to train people, hard to attract people and we put in a lot of efforts to make sure that there is enough opportunities inside of EPAM for people to realize and stay here.  So we just mentioned, for example, Software Engineering Conference and there a couple of components on talent. And so on the engineering side and on creative side, and how to make sure that this type of people can work together, which is create relatively unique environment for them to stay.  Basically, on the engineering side, we are doing this for very, very long time. So, and we put in more efficient program how to train people, at the same time how to explain why EPAM is different and why opportunities is different here. But again, it is very challenging and it's just generally industry a huge challenge.  And on the more creative digital part of – which is part of people we have to retain and attract, it's also a little bit changing from geographical point of view. It's more in client-facing locations. While it's still pretty significant and very competitive in our development centers as well. So, there is no simple answer, but we invest in heavily in recruitment, in training, in opportunity building across our projects, so.
Darrin Peller: I mean, to be clear, it seems fine this quarter, but I just want to be sure, I mean, there is nothing that's changing around the ability for you to maintain both the split of the cost of the labor to pricing. In other words, the margin implications on it, nothing has changed there. Is that fair? I just want to make sure going forward we model that correctly.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think you are touching on very right points and this is definitely challenged, but again, the challenge for everybody when – and we are getting this for a long time. As you can see, during the last six quarters, we have some volatility in recruitment because of utilization and different type of impacts. But for example, in Q3, we had the largest number of new employees join the company through different sources. So, I think we don't have simple answer, but we know how to kind of address the challenge.
Darrin Peller: Okay. All right. I’ll leave it there guys. Thanks very much.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Ramsey El-Assal: Sure. I was wondering if you could give us kind of your latest thoughts on M&A? How active is your pipeline? Whether you are evaluating deals? What type of deals might be most interesting to you?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Again, I think you expect our usual answer here too. So we have a pipeline, we have deals in discussions right now. I don't think we can comment on specifics. But in general, we are always looking how to improve our client-facing capabilities and how to extend specific capabilities from industry expertise to digital to engineering takes long time. So, again, I don't think we would comment on specifics until it's happened.
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. I have – can you give us some idea about, in terms of your kind of revenue growth algorithm, how much of your organic growth is from cross-selling or up-selling existing clients versus signing new logos? Which is the more important driver? Is it evenly split there?
Jason Peterson: Well, I guess when we look at the growth, I think we are quite pleased with the fact that we are generating growth from I guess, both pieces of that equation. So we are seeing growth in our Top-20 customers once we've got through the long-established relationships with growing at 15% a year in Q3. And actually if you net out UBS, it would be over 20%.  And then, in our other than Top-20, I believe the growth rate is actually 37%. So what you're seeing is continued growth in customers that we have longstanding relationships with and then you are seeing quite robust growth from customers that we are adding in growth with those newer customers.
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. Just to be clear, it's pretty even split between those two drivers.
Jason Peterson: I think that's fair.
Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Anil Doradla: Good morning guys. And congratulations from my end too. So, Arkadiy you rightly pointed out never seen so many engineers being hired in this one particular quarter. Was it from any particular geography? Was it focused for any particular client? Some – any color on that.
Arkadiy Dobkin: No, it was split o – like equally spread across geographies and there is no any specific client which was driving us. So this is, again, a reflection of diversification of our client base, as well that you talked about.
Anil Doradla: Great. And as a follow-up, Arkadiy, as we look into 2018, I know you guys are not giving in any formal guidance right now. But any kind of qualitative color on kind of the demand environment, what you are seeing? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, Anil, we would like to be consistent. So, all we can say is that we believe that we can continue growing over 20% organically. So, and – that's how we are trying to design the future from clients to delivery capabilities.
Anil Doradla: Very good. Congrats on the solid execution guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Sure, thanks. Good quarter. Ark, questions on some of the solution development that you guys are doing with regards to working with clients on A.I. projects, IoT projects and so on so forth. I would imagine the demand for those kinds of projects is pretty high.  And this is a topic again, we've discussed before to some extent, but anytime I look at the growth of A.I, it seems to me a company like your service which has very strong software development capabilities might actually do well with having your own software-focused approach in a little part of your business.  Can you provide us with the logic of how you are thinking on that? I know the bulk of your business is always services-focused, but there are parts that might be better suited for software.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, we – I think we said this during the Investor Day as well as that we are really focusing on developing number of accelerators for our solutions. We are still are not going to – not planning to go with product strategy – for the product strategy, but solution accelerators around specifics including what you mentioned, because it's becoming really interesting drivers for new clients and it’s becoming very important part for them to compete.  And solution - kind of solution accelerators around engineering productivity and we are also focusing right now on some specific solutions around talent management, talent growth, because that's what we can apply to ourselves.  In regards to all this - how we see artificial intelligence and automation, we partner with some of our clients as and with market leaders. But again, considering how to put accelerators on top of this to be faster.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Sure, got it. And…
Arkadiy Dobkin: And Ashwin, like in this category and this is typical, most of the products not necessarily mature today because it’s all experimentation which is giving us additional advantage and that's why we need these accelerators, because very often we need to cover for the lack in functionality or stability of this type of product and that's exactly where we think our competitive advantage is.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Understood, understood. As one other thing as we try to break down the elements of EPAM's growth, which now began one more quarter of fairly robust growth here, what I am trying to think of is sort of the same-store sales metric how you are increasingly penetrating existing clients?  And how your sales force is positioned to do that on an ongoing basis. Could you provide maybe sort of hunting versus farming type of a breakdown with regards to your sales force?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, we are getting new logos and we have the team, which is focusing exclusively on hunting. At the same time, our growth completely impossible result very good farming and this is what, historically, is the main driver of our growth and it’s still probably the most important part.  So, we mentioned that we have like, right now 200 clients with $2 million plus revenue, which is great huge opportunity for continue this lend and extend approach. For both business developments in both the segments, I think consultative approach is becoming much more important and we talked about our ambitions to build relatively efficient consulting communication.  So, and pairing with our competency centers kind of to grow and do this in very good orchestration. So, I think, that's kind of like very high-level review is possibly on this call.
Jason Peterson: And as you know, we are certainly seeing an acceleration in the revenues that we are generating from our new customers. And so, as Ark indicated, we continue to see quite a bit of revenue growth from farming, but the hunting is increasingly generating growth as well.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Can I squeeze in one more question, just a clarification on the tax rate...
Arkadiy Dobkin: Ashwin, and then even here, I would call it on top of what Jason mentioned, our counting still a lot referral which we were out of this because that's reputational type of extension to new logos and that's what we would like to make sure that we kind of keeping out, because I think our delivery reputation should be main driver for new sales referral.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Yes, I don’t know how…
Jason Peterson: You can squeeze in your question.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Yes, yes. So the tax rate question that I had was if the clarification on the lower tax rate entirely due to – it’s not mix or anything else, it's entirely due to one factor, which is stock-based compensation that will change this and why should that not be your go-forward assumption not just for one quarter, but going forward?
Jason Peterson: Yes, and so If you look at the GAAP tax rate, that clearly is in there. If you look at the non-GAAP tax rate, obviously, that's not part of that. And so, I would say that in terms of the – somewhat of the decline we've seen in the tax rate that that is a little bit due to the greater revenue profits that we are producing in the offshore centers as we’ve sort of driven the headcount increase that Arkadiy talked about and the higher utilization.  And so, I think in the second half of this year, you've seen a somewhat greater percentage of our revenue profits come from those locations where the tax rates are generally lower. I do think next year, what you'll see is, maybe a little bit of our return back as we pursue our strategy of greater sort of client-basing resources and delivery teams.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Understood. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Amit Singh: Hi, this is Amit Singh for Jason. Just a quick question on your constant currency revenue growth, as we look at, it seems like it's growing at around two times, your sort of client-serving headcount in third quarter and it was like similar in second quarter. Just trying to understand the drivers here and is that sustainable?
Jason Peterson: Yes, so I'd say it had a couple of factors when I think about the growth. So you've got one is obviously the growth in the headcount and so we had a very robust addition of headcount in Q3, which included both talent acquisition, so talent from outside the market. And then also our resource development capability, which is to take younger recent university graduates and sort of train and develop them and to bring them into our development organizations, as well. So you've got the two pieces of - let's call that headcount or resource addition.  The other piece is that you have is the utilization improvement and the combination of those two have had helped drive - have helped drive revenue growth. But, as I think we’ve discussed we have a very strong demand across all of our geographies across our pretty much all of our industry verticals and then both from new and existing customers and we feel that we've very much got a series of engines in place to continue to add the headcount that we need to grow revenue in 2018.
Amit Singh: All right, perfect. And just quickly, I mean, if I look at your full year guidance, adjusted operating margin guidance, it seems like you would probably need still some ramp up in your and adjusted operating margin in fourth quarter to get to around the middle of that guidance range.  So just your confidence level in that. I know historically, I mean, last quarter the fourth quarter adjusted margin was slightly below third quarter, but in the prior year, they've been higher. So just trying to understand how the dynamics play out this year?
Jason Peterson: I mean, there were some challenges last year that were specific to a single customer, maybe pretty much a single customer. This year, I think we would see a more traditional pattern and historically, what we’ve seen is an improvement in utilization as we go from Q3 to Q4.  And so again, that's a historic pattern that you see as you come out of the summer quarter, which has higher vacations and as a result, lower utilization. And so higher utilization, historically, would produce both higher revenue and higher profitability.
Amit Singh: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question come from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.
Joseph Foresi: Hi, can you talk about growth in Europe and its drivers and maybe give us an update on UBS?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think the update on UBS is pretty straightforward. It's stabilized. It's a little bit growing, but in general, it's not impacting so much that overall. It should be closer to over 10% for several quarters and thereof. So in general, demand coming from traditional sectors, it's still coming and you see it we provided numbers outside of UBS impact from Financial Services and from retail from media. So, practically pretty equally distributed across segments.
Joseph Foresi: Got it. And then the second question, can you talk about a little bit about the pipeline. Are you working on any large deals? And the reason why I ask is usually headcount additions like this imply that there is some demand out there that needs to be addressed or is it more balanced? Thanks. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: It is pretty balanced and don't try to retool too deeply in this situation. Just remember that we have at some point very low utilization last year just twelve months ago and then we have to utilize people who slow down and hiring can for several quarters where utilizing the people very well at the branch and now we are just getting back to normal talent acquisition processes and clearly, the biggest size on it where twelve months ago and this is just natural reflections.
Jason Peterson: And demand is very broad based across large number of customers and industry segments.
Joseph Foresi: Got it. Helpful, thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Moshe Katri: Hey guys, thanks. Good morning. Was there any sort of pricing tailwind during the quarter? And then, what are you embedding in terms of your guidance for pricing? And then, going back to Darrin's question earlier in terms of recruiting, is there any change in terms of wage inflation assumptions by region or by some of the major regions in your numbers? Thanks.
Jason Peterson: So when you say pricing tailwinds, are you referring to foreign exchange or it’s something else?
Moshe Katri: I am talking some of the bill rate increases that we are embedding in our models.
Jason Peterson: Yes, and so I think what we continue to see is sort of stable pricing and as I think we've talked about in the past, we do have – to have customers where we are getting annual price increases. But again, the pricing environment is stable.  Back to the question around the wage inflation as Ark said, it's a competitive market, but there is a number of levers to maintain gross margin that includes utilization, that includes pyramid, and so yes, I think we are generally comfortable.
Moshe Katri: So wage inflation is still kind of roughly somewhere in the mid-single-digits. Is that still the right number to use on a blended basis?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Again, mid-single-digits, I think it's – it would vary by geography. 
Jason Peterson: I think we're seeing a slight increase in wage inflation to be fair, but at the same time, what I am trying to communicate early is we do have the ability to sort of mitigate that through adjustments and pyramid to made adjustments and where and how we deliver.
Moshe Katri: And then bill rate increases is still also kind of somewhere in the low-single-digits?
Jason Peterson: Yes, it's sort of consistent with what we talked about in the past. If you are looking to sort of updated model, yes, we’d keep the assumptions the same as what we've communicated in prior quarters.
Moshe Katri: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arvind Ramnani with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Arvind Ramnani: Yes, hey, congrats on a good quarter. I just wanted to get your view on the overall environment and if you could contrast it to last year. Last year we had a bunch of uncertainties around directions and UBS. And given that the environment is much better, how should we start thinking about kind of – as we enter into next year? Not looking for guidance, just trying to get a sense of what your view of the environment is?
Arkadiy Dobkin: You see, with all respect to elections, I think the last year, the main impact was still from UBS for us and results size and with our kind of market penetration. I think, if you take UBS out, and now we see that it was pretty specific situation to this specific client. I think it's pretty consistent.  The demand for this – again overused, but there is reason why term like digital transformation is very strong and it's driving a lot of new client engagements today. And with relation to this, a lot of vacant rebuild and modernization activities. So I don't see big difference with exceptions that Q3 last year was really impactful but one specific client.
Arvind Ramnani: Great. Thank you very much and good luck for the remainder of the year.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Steven Milunovich: Thank you. I just wonder how you are thinking about OpEx going forward. You've been hiring consultants. So in terms of SG&A investments, do you see any lumpiness or surprises there? And if we look out a year, would you think we’d be more at the high or low-end of this 16% to 18% range?
Jason Peterson: Yes, I don't think we're ready to guide yet on where we are going to be in the 16% to 18% range over the coming year. I think we need a little bit more time here to think about that here in Q4. From your question on SG&A is that we are making investments in our consulting capability to advance our ability to sort of deliver and to work and deliver solutions to our customers. But it's not going to show up as a significant SG&A spend.  And then, the other thing is that the portion of those resources will be billable. And so, if you go to the P&L, say they'll show up in core and they'll generate revenues that will offset their costs. And so I don't think you should expect a material increase in SG&A coming from some of those shifts.
Steven Milunovich: Okay. And on the competitive front, the Indians are always trying to move up toward your capabilities. Do you see any success there? And is your price premium relative to the Indians changed at all?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It's very difficult to comment on the price comparisons, because that's usually not a open information. So everybody trying to build these digital capabilities and you see the number of acquisitions with global service providers and companies like Accenture doing on more and more regular basis.  So, at the same time, I think markets still growing faster than capabilities and there is a big demand and I don't think it's very visible that something changing on the market. I mean, there are good opportunities. The main challenge is still to have right capabilities and right balance of these capabilities for this type of deals.
Steven Milunovich: Great.
Jason Peterson: Just so, I just might add that when you look at our growth in certain segments where obviously there is a high digital component, we grew 42% year-over-year. So, I think that speaks to the strength of our capabilities and the work that we are doing for our customers.
Steven Milunovich: Great.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Vladimir Bespalov with VTB Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Vladimir Bespalov: Hello and congratulations on the very good results. I have a follow-up question on UBS. I made some calculations. I mean, it looks like in the last quarter, these accounts started to grow sequentially after like several years of pretty fledged performance. If that's the case and can we speak about the turnaround with this account and in general like with the overall situation in the Financial Services sector growing pretty good. But do you see any improvement in the industry as a whole? Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Vladimir, first of all, UBS was the first pick up happened exactly one year ago. So before that, it was pretty strongly growing account for us. So, but all we can comment that it's much more stable. We can predict better like this level of stability because, if you remember, our comments before, we were always saying, like let's take a look at the next quarter. So – and I would kind of end with type of comment right now.  So, general stability - you are asking about general stability of financial industry, again, for us it’s stable, for us it's growing, and again UBS was an exception. Like Financial Services with the exception of UBS grew 27% and that was practically through during the last periods as well.
Vladimir Bespalov: Okay, thank you. And maybe you could provide some comments on Life Sciences & Healthcare as well, because there was a pretty good acceleration of growth year-on-year after previous - like the previous quarters?
Arkadiy Dobkin: And you see, for us, it's very difficult to kind of single out one vertical against another, because that’s what we are trying to explain majority of our services are in new developments. We don't have a lot of legacy support and maintenance activities. And practically, all sectors on which we focus in is high growth sectors for us for the type of engagements and Life Science is a good example of this as well.
Vladimir Bespalov: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question come from the line of Georgios Kertsos with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question.
Georgios Kertsos: Yes, hi guys. A very quick one, high level question for me. I am - thinking of growth, is - have you seen in the last - this last quarter or based on the visibility that you have as of now, do you expect to see any sort of divergence between volume and pricing in any of your sectors or geographies? Anything that you can, sort of comfortably call out there? That’s for me. Thank you.
Jason Peterson: So, yes, so in the near term, I am not sure that we see a divergent between volume and price. I think longer term, we've talked about the fact that we will likely see more of our work come out of our customer-facing geographies and so over the mid-term to longer-term what you could see is, a divergent between volume and price, just because the on-site or customer-facing geographies would have higher rates than the offshore geographies.  So, I guess, the only other you are not… okay. Just as a reminder, we are a T&M business, 90% over - slightly over 90% of our revenues come from T&M. And so you don't see significant changes based on things that could be happening with a large fixed engagement. Again, we are substantially sort of a T&M.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Vladimir Bespalov with VTB Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Georgios Kertsos: Thank you for taking my question. I would like to talk to you about the cash which you are having on your balance sheet. It keeps growing and growing. You have answered this question quite a number of times in the past, but still, I mean you have much more than you can stand on exhibitions probably, but what is the longer-term strategy for using cash? Thank you.
Jason Peterson: Yes, we are over $500 million in cash. We had very strong cash production in Q3 as you are aware. 75% of that cash is offshore. And so, what we feel this time is, the cash we have in place very much is there to support our acquisition strategy and our inter-growth strategy.  We do have discussions around what we might do longer-term, but I wouldn't comment on that at this time and instead, we just continue to focus on, I guess, the question that was asked by at Oracle while back, which is about our acquisition strategy and we continue to be active.
Georgios Kertsos: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Abhishek [Indiscernible] with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. Can market share or larger gains that – large existing or relatively new clients explain the nice delta between headcount and revenue growth in recent quarters?
Jason Peterson: Yes, I mean we are certainly seeing that. Clearly, an ongoing growth in our existing customers as I think we talked about sort of 15% excluding UBS for our Top-20 customers and over 20%, if you exclude UBS. I think probably it's still a combination of things, which probably is more headcount growth and utilization, okay, as well as obviously, expanded revenue across the host of clients including our new customers.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Arkadiy Dobkin for closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you. We are clearly pleased with our results in Q3 and kind of excited about how went through year shaping our path right now, so. And looking forward to update you in three months what really would happen. See you here in three months. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to EPAM Systems Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, David Straube.
David Straube: Thank you, Operator, and good morning everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's second quarter fiscal 2017 results. If you have not, a copy is available at epam.com in the Investors Section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of our comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP numbers have been reconciled to GAAP and are available in our investor materials in the Investors Section of our website. With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. Let us start with a few key highlights on EPAM overall performance in the second quarter. Our growth was broad based across both geographies and industries, the revenue for Q2 climbing U.S.$649 million, representing 23% year-over-year growth or 23.7% in constant currency growth, from a vertical perspective, with a strong growth across the majority of our industry segments. In reporting currency, financial services, our legacy vertical continued the quarter with 7.6% growth which reflects the effect of the UBS revenue trends we discussed during our previous earnings call. Excluding the impact of UBS financial services grew 31.6% in Q2. Demand from financial services is being driven by digitalization, regulatory changes in addition to record improvements. Travel and consumer finished the quarter at 21.7% growth with demand climbing from digital transformation projects as well as day-to-day earnings side programs. Software and Hi-Tech grew 20.2% for the quarter based on diversified portfolio of software emerging start-ups and technology companies going over digital platform transformations. Media and entertainment grew 52.3% driven by our engagements in digital services, major information providers, publishers, and broadcasters. Life Sciences and Healthcare grew 3% over the same quarter last year. Year-over-year growth was mostly imparted with retirement at one of our clients' with significant increase in revenue in Q2 of last year. Excluding this effect, year-over-year growth was 21.5% and 6.7% sequentially. Worth to mention in healthcare, we continue to see demand in patient health management initiatives and major healthcare player and medical hospital managing provider in Q2 to all countries. Emerging verticals at 60.1%, growth was driven mostly by energy and telecommunications. Revenue expectation across our clients continues to grow outside of the top 20 accounts climbing in at 37% with growth in the top 20 adjust on to 10% or more than 18% excluding the effect of UBS. And our continued focus in helping our clients to address the challenges of digitally driven changes have led to broad opportunities across the Fortune 2000. In Q2, our growth was broad-based across year-over-year. In constant currency terms, North America grew 27%, Europe growth was 19% year-over-year or 34% excluding the effect of UBS. This two geographic areas combine representing 94% of our revenues. Additionally our CIS region grew 17% and APAC grew 24% in constant currency terms. Our people. We ended with over 20,480 professionals a 12% increase year-over-year bringing our total in place head count more than 23,200. Utilization for the quarter was 79.6%, climbing higher than our historical ranges due to tighter management during this period. We do expect utilization in Q3 to be down due to seasonality and natural volatility in supply and demand cycles. And in balanced market that is always is increasingly competitive. We remain focused on attracting, retaining, and developing the right talent to support the current and future growth needs. In regards to overall market demand, the rate of disruption among our clients continues to offer extremely fast pace creating the challenge of successfully mitigating through important technology and operational confirmations. We do believe we're still in the early stages of this digital era, this digital platform engineering extending from the consumer to the enterprise driving the need for next generation capabilities in areas such as full stock, engineering, [indiscernible], automation, and cyber security. We continued to see real strengths in demand across our verticals service lines and geographies and we believe this demand for next generation capabilities and engineering deliver skills will continue for the foreseeable future. So as we will our business to position it for the future. Our priority will be to continue investing across multiple areas including corporate and people talent infrastructure in line with our growth rate needs to allow us to establish new and growing capabilities with a focus on delivering increasingly sophisticated end-to-end integrated business and technology solution this is initiated by our advanced engineering capabilities. Our profitability for the first half of this fiscal year reflect this ongoing investment and going forward you should expect this level of investment will continue and at times vary quarter-to-quarter. With that let me turn it over to Jason for a detailed financial update of our Q2 results and our fiscal 2017 guidance.
Jason Peterson: Thank you, Ark. Good morning everyone. Our service and financial highlights talk about profitability then cash flow and then guidance. As Ark mentioned we delivered strong top-line performance and generated solid free cash flow in the second quarter. Here are a few key highlights from the quarter. Revenue closed to $349 million, 23% growth over the second quarter of last year and 7.5% sequentially. Year-over-year constant currency growth was 23.7% reflecting a modest headwind of 0.7% which was less than anticipated. Actual revenues compared to our Q2 guidance benefited from stronger revenue production of $2.9 million and a favorable currency impact of $6.1 million. From a geographic perspective North America our largest region representing 59% of our Q2 revenues, grew 26.6% year-over-year and 26.9% in constant currency. Europe representing 34.8% of our Q2 revenue grew 16.8% year-over-year and 19.4% in constant currency. Absent the effect of UBS growth in Europe was 34% in constant currency; CIS grew 27.2% year-over-year or 17.1% in constant currency and now represents 4.2% of our revenue. And lastly APAC grew 21.9% year-over-year and 24.3% in constant currency and now represents 2% of our revenue. So moving down the income statement gross margin for the quarter was 36.9% compared to 36.3% for the same quarter last year. The 60 basis point year-over-year increase resulted from higher utilization which ended at 79.6% compared to 74.1% in the same quarter last year, and 77.5% in Q1 of fiscal 2017. The increase in utilization was offset by a negative foreign exchange impact, a higher level of payroll tax related to options exercises and employee compensation. In constant currency terms gross margin was 37.8%. GAAP SG&A was 23% of revenue compared to 22.6% in Q2 fiscal 2016. Included in this quarter's SG&A were higher costs related to an increase in personnel related expenditures including payroll tax associated with the exercise of stock options. In addition, an increase in investments to continue supporting expansion in our client base in geographies. Non-GAAP SG&A which excludes stock-based compensation expense and certain other items came in at 20.4% compared to 19.6% in the same period last year. As Ark mentioned, our SG&A reflects the continued investment in our talent acquisition, extension of our global footprint, and building onsite capabilities with a focus on supporting our long-term sustainable growth strategy. GAAP income from operations was $40.7 million compared to $32.1 million in Q2 last year, representing 11.7% of revenue in the quarter. Non-GAAP income from operations was $55.8 million compared to $47.6 million in Q2 last year representing 16% of revenue. Our GAAP effective tax rate for this quarter came in at 13.2%. The lower than expected tax rate was a result of the adoption of the recently announced stock-based compensation pronouncement and the generation of the greater than expected tax benefit due to a higher level of exercised options. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.7%. For the quarter, we generated $0.68 of GAAP EPS which reflects an FX gain rather than unexpected FX loss lower than expected stock compensation expense in addition to the lower tax rate. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.80 compared with non-GAAP EPS of $0.71 in the second quarter of last year, reflecting a 12.7% increase. Total shares outstanding for Q2 were approximately 54.8 million higher than the expected level of 54.3 million, largely due to the sizable number of options exercised in the quarter. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash from operations for Q2 was $27.9 million compared with $38.5 million in the same quarter last year. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to the impact of a reduction in DSO in Q2 last year, coupled with an increase in DSO in Q2 of this year. Free cash flow came in at $22.2 million compared with $31.1 million in the same quarter last year resulting in a 50.7% conversion of adjusted net income. Total DSO was 82 days compared to 88 days in the same quarter last year, AR DSO was 54 days and our unbilled DSO was 28 days. Turning now to guidance. Starting with full year fiscal 2017 revenue growth will now be at least 23% and we expect constant currency growth will continue to be at least 23%. For the full year we now expect the impact of foreign exchange will be flat. We expect GAAP income from operations to now be in the range of 12% to 13% and non-GAAP income from operations will now be in the range of 16% to 17% which reflects our first half performance. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate will now be approximately 16% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate will now be approximately 22%. Earnings per share we now expect GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $2.57 for the full year driven primarily by a lower effective tax rate attributed to greater than expected excess income tax benefit from stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP EPS will now be at least $3.29 for the full year. The updated non-GAAP EPS reflects greater than expected employee stock option exercises driving both higher total share count and greater payroll tax expense. We now expect weighted average share count of 55.2 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For Q3, revenues will be at least $367 million for the third quarter reflecting a growth rate of at least 23% after 1% currency tailwinds meaning we expect constant currency growth will be at least 22%. For the third quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. This range reflects a seasonal impact of utilization in Q3. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate will now be approximately 16.5% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate will now be approximately 22%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $0.68 and non-GAAP EPS to be at least $0.84 for the quarter. We expect the weighted average share count of 55.6 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Few key assumptions which support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock compensation expense is now expected to be approximately $11.2 million in Q3 and $10.9 million in Q4. Amortization of intangibles is now expected to be approximately $1.9 million in each remaining quarter. FX losses are now expected to be approximately $2 million for each quarter. Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is now expected to be approximately $4 million in each remaining quarter. Lastly, with the recent adoption of ASU 2016-09, and as a result of moment in our stock price, we expect future volatility in our effective tax rates and GAAP EPS. We expect an excess tax benefit of approximately $2 million for each remaining quarter. Thank you. And let me turn the call back to David.
David Straube: Thanks, Jason. I'd like to ask that each of you keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call, please?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Anil Doradla with William Blair. Please take your question.
Anil Doradla: Hey guys good morning and good job on the top-line. So when you look at the top-line and the upper division for the full year was it driven by any particular end market customers or was it kind of more widespread as you saw in the current quarter.
Arkadiy Dobkin: It’s usually again you saw the concentration of clients is kind of becoming better balance or basically it's spread but we definitely have a number of our new large clients which you grow in very faster and creating potential for future grows. So again it's needed but there are very specific, specific engagements which drive into this now.
Anil Doradla: And in terms of geographic expansion over the next call it 12 months is there any particular geography around the world where you expect to emphasize in terms of headcount growth.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Headcount growth. Headcount growth well for us right now is usual and pretty much balanced around all our main delivery locations. So clearly still Eastern Europe which includes all Hungary, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Israel, we planning to grow in India too.
Anil Doradla: And don't mind me speaking in one thing the EPS reset was that purely driven by just this option stuff going around or was there any other particular you talked about options and share count but was there anything else or was it just driven by this.
Jason Peterson: Yes, the $0.09 reduction is just largely driven by the result of the impact of the greater than expected stock option exercises and so as we've said it's basically two impacts, one you've got the additional payroll tax expense and then the second is just the dilution impact and that's broken out by $0.07 by the additional payroll tax expense and $0.02 from the dilution.
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please state your question.
Steve Milunovich: Thank you very much. You're building pretty significant cash on the balance sheet. How do you think about the use of the cash over the next couple of years?
Jason Peterson: Yes, from a use of the cash standpoint, today we prioritize allocation of capital for our inorganic growth strategy. At the same time we are sensitive to dilution. So, capital allegation is an ongoing topic that we discussed with the board no change at this time but I think what we would update you as we evolve our thinking on that topic.
Steve Milunovich: Okay. And at the Investor Day you spoke about recruiting the right talent to keep moving up the value stack part of that was getting to main experts with more consulting capabilities. Can you update us on how that initiative is moving and how we should think about the impacts on margin and revenue per engineer going forward?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we definitely executing on this plan and we're bringing people. So, how it's going to impact any financial metrics is difficult to predict as this go and so. Clearly it could be little bit volatile because we bring in. We plan -- we’re bringing and we're planning to bring more consultative people in the market is prior question and probably would be some gap between the time they joined and the time they start to really perform and become billable. But again there is no specific projection how it’s going to impact; we do believe that we would be able to manage it in normal way of business. Hello?
Operator: Steve, are you there? Okay. Our next question is from Arvind Ramnani from KeyBanc. Please state your question.
Jason Washburn: Good morning guys. This is Jason Washburn in for Arvind. I'm just curious what investments are you guys making in AI. What capabilities do you currently have in AI and how do you expect your business model to change if AI becomes more integral to your offering?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we have competence through this specific expertise in this. So we actually involved in multiple implementation of we process automation solutions, so how it's going to impact significantly anything in smaller short-term, I don't think we can judge on this. But we definitely focus on this area and it's one of the most interesting future service lines for us for sure, we didn’t have traditional BPO services which would be mostly impacted by this. So we do invest in this and we do have some advantage.
Operator: Our next question is from Vladimir Bespalov. Please state your question.
Vladimir Bespalov: Hello, my question is actually on your margins guidance, you lowered the upper balance of the guided ranges for the full year despite previous strong revenue trend, could you elaborate a little bit what is behind this?
Jason Peterson: Sure. So we're really narrowing the range from 16% to 18% to 16% to 17% and it’s largely just a reflection of our first half results. So if you'll remember we had 15.2% in Q1 and 16% in Q2 and so I should remind you that the Q1 performance included the impact of the $1.9 million land tax and so the narrowing I think just kind of reflects kind of our first half performance and I think if you do the math, you will see that we’re expecting improvement in remainder of the year.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Avishai Kantor with Cowen & Company. Please state your question.
Avishai Kantor: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. On pricing, since the last conference call, you said that you were talking about stable pricing environment, is that still the case?
Jason Peterson: Yes. We've seen a stable pricing environment and as I think we've talked about in the past, we continue to get angled price increases across a number of our customers and so definitely stable and with the opportunity for some improvement on an annual basis.
Avishai Kantor: And a follow-up, regarding the acquisition in India any changes in how it is factored into the model in the last three to six months on the impact of the India acquisition on the model in last three to six months?
Arkadiy Dobkin: No, we talked about it pretty extensively I think during the previous calls and I think transition investor days. There is no changes since last periods. We’re improving delivery quality and we kind of bring this to the general EPAM standards, so that's our main focus right now.
Operator: Our next question is from Carlos López with Credit Suisse. Please ask your question.
Q – Carlos López: Hi, I wanted to ask about the working capital increase on the cash flow, I think it's driven by the increase in DSO, so could you please little bit elaborate on this, what were the reason for it and shall we expect the further negative cash impact from working capital? Thank you.
Jason Peterson: Sure. Yes, so primarily this story is around the DSO and so what you're seeing is actually a substantial improvement in DSO on an year-over-year basis so, I think you'll remember that we were over 90 in Q1 of last year we were flat I think 88 in Q2 of last year and then we're down to 82 which is kind of where we guided but the 82 is an increase over Q1 and so clearly that does has an impact.
Operator: Our next question is from Vladimir Bespalov with VTB Capital. Please state your question.
Vladimir Bespalov: Thank you for taking my follow up question. I would like to ask you about UBS and outlook if my calculations are correct, they are approaching to the levels stipulated by your long-term agreements in terms of revenue generation a little bit about that level so, do you expect like going forward the impact of UBS on your growth rate to diminish and in general what do you see as the outlook for the coming quarters for this account. Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Again, we don't care for any specific update on this. I think our long-term agreement actually indicated a minimum commitment. So and we this and above this how this account going to develop in the future it's a very difficult to predict. We don't see any specific signs to share, the same like we were talking about it before it is in pretty stable condition to now, yes.
Jason Peterson: Yes, I just add to that so, UBS is certainly stable it’s performing within our expectations and we continue to see rapid growth in smaller accounts and new accounts within EPAM. So what I do think you'll see is that -- it has a let’s say modest impact on growth rates over time as we continue to grow other accounts.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Mitch Mitchell with ECS. Please state your question.
Mitch Mitchell: I just wanted to ask about the staffing again it seems like you're hiring rates slowed down a little bit this quarter is that -- is that the case or is this just something a little bit may be seasonal. Sort of lumpiness in the hiring process I mean just related to that can you give us an attrition figure for the quarter. Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it’s a little bit different reason because several quarters ago we were talking about our utilization levels which were below what you wanted and some unexpected branch existed due to some changes on UBS side. And clearly our recruitment cycles where under our very detailed control so and right now we coming back to current exercise of the current 12% increase is much more than it was last quarter so, we just increasing hiring right now but it’s some normal kind of cycling right now.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Okay, ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to Ark for closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: As usual thank you very much for joining us today so, I simply have pretty strong quarter on revenue side. We also continue growing. I would share actually one [indiscernible] like we were talking about UBS and our growth outside of UBS right now around 29% which means that the future is stability of the account. The growth should be -- should be good so and with this so we will see you next quarter. Thank you very much.
Jason Peterson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to EPAM Systems First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now turn the conference over to Mr. David Straube, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Straube, you may begin.
David Straube: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter of fiscal 2017 results. If you have not, a copy is available at epam.com in the Investors Section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; Anthony Conte, Chief Financial Officer; and Jason Peterson, Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements.

Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP numbers have been reconciled to GAAP and are available in our investors materials in the Investors Section of our website. With that said, let me turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Let us start with the main highlights on EPAM overall performance in Q1. Revenue for Q1 was growing strongly across our business, coming in at $324.7 million representing a 22.7% year-over-year growth and 23.9% constant currency growth. From a vertical perspective, all our industry segments with the exception of financial services were up more than 20% organically in constant currency terms. In reporting currency, Software and Hi-Tech grew 21.4% for the quarter, with demand coming from high-end product development services we provide across a number of our key clients in this vertical as well as fast-growing startups. Media and Entertainment grew 50.9%. Due to the demands related to enhancing end-user capabilities as well as extending the consumer e-commerce experience fault lines. Life Sciences and Healthcare had growth of 28.7%, which was driven by the expansion of our engagements into commercial and enterprise IT environments. Additionally, our expertise in data sciences and genomic data continues to make us a partner of choice across all life science clients, which increasingly focus on translational informatics and precision medicine. Travel and Consumer finished the quarter at 18.9% or 21.8% in constant currency. This demand coming from digital transformation projects as well as data-driven insight programs. Financial services finished the quarter with 4.9% growth, which as you understand reflects the effect of the UBS revenue trends we discussed during our last couple of calls. Finally, emerging verticals had 45.1% growth driven mostly by energy and telecommunications. From geographical points of view, in both North America, which represents 58% of EPAM market today; and Europe, which is 35.2%, our organic growth was over 24% in constant currency. And in CIS region, revenue was growing over 20% in constant currency terms as well. It'd be also worth to mention that in Q1, our client portfolio across Fortune 2000 companies reached 120 customers, and now, is the most diverse it has ever been at EPAM. This reflects our ongoing focus on the well balanced growth of our client base across the industries and geographies. For this quarter, our growth rate outside the top 20 accounts was 34%. Growth in the top 20 accounts was 12% and, excluding UBS, top 20 growth was 20.1%. Several other points I would like to address upfront. On UBS, we do believe the account is stable at this point and we saw a slight sequential growth this quarter. It also worth to mention that excluding the effect of UBS, our financial services would be growing 19.7%. Utilization and people. As we said before, we plan to focus on utilization during the first half of 2017. Today, we can say that we are on the right track with 77% utilization, which is where we expect it to be. Specific to headcount in Q1. We ended with over 19,678 professionals, a 15% increase year-over-year, bringing our total employee headcount to 22,400 people. Raising headcount reflected our ongoing focus on driving utilization improvements. On profitability, upsetting our strong revenue performance in Q1, we did have a few unanticipated items, which weighted on our margin and overall profitability. Anthony will provide more details in his comments. Overall, our Q1 results have placed us on solid start for the fiscal year. It also demonstrated broad-based growth across our verticals, which underscores the relevance of our capabilities to the clients and EPAM continues focus on investing in the quality of our technology practices, engineering productivity, industry accelerators and maturity of the delivery processes and tools as well as broadening the overall service verticals we bring to the market. In short, this result reflect well our ability to respond to such market demand as a professional product development needs enabled with EPAM unique core engineering and delivery capabilities. Digital transformation needs for large enterprises to re-envision their existing businesses as well as to develop new lines of businesses to sustain the current position, while being able to continue addressing the attacks of disruptors in their respective markets. Lastly, constant search for partners for innovation. In an effort to create differentiated IP and new software driven to enable products and business models, and applying the technology to radically optimize today's operational environment. In other words, to become disruptors in their own or new markets. The market trends we generated those demands continue to be the backdrop of both our growth and what is driving our clients' agenda. As they transform their businesses to remain competitive in the fast-paced and dynamic environment. Moreover, in turn, it's forcing us as a company to transform ourselves to satisfy such demands even faster than we ever expected to do before. And I think we'll talk on this topic in more details during our Investor Day next week in New York. With that, let me turn it over to Anthony for detailed financial update for our Q1 results and our fiscal 2017 guidance.
Anthony Conte: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some financial highlights, talk about profitability, cash flow and end on guidance. As Ark mentioned, we delivered strong top line performance and generated significant free cash flow in the first quarter. Here are a few key highlights from the quarter. Revenue closed at $324.7 million, 22.7% over first quarter of last year and 3.5% sequentially. Year-over-year, constant currency growth of 23.9%, reflecting 1.2% of headwinds less than anticipated. Actual revenues compared to our Q1 guidance benefited from stronger revenue production of $5.1 million and more favorable currency impact of $4.6 million. From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region, representing 58.3% of our Q1 revenues, grew 24.2% year-over-year; Europe, representing 35.2% of our Q1 revenue, grew 19.6% year-over-year or 24.9% in constant currency; APAC grew 3.5% and 6.1% in constant currency and now represents 2% of our revenue. And lastly, CIS grew 43.1% and 20.3% in constant currency and represents 4.5% of our revenue. Moving down the income statement; gross margin for the quarter was 36% compared to 36.7% for the same quarter last year. The 70 basis point year-over-year decline was primarily driven by 1% impact from foreign exchange, meaning in constant currency terms, gross margin would have been 37%. Utilization ended at 77.5% compared to 76.7% in the same quarter last year and 75.9% in Q4. GAAP SG&A was 24.2% compared to 23.3% of revenue in Q1 fiscal 2016. Included in this quarter's SG&A was an unexpected $1.9 million facility construction-related expense as well as higher stock compensation expense related to the recent growth in the stock price. Non-GAAP SG&A excludes all stock compensation expense and certain other items came in at 20.8% compared to 20.5% in the same period last year. We continue to leverage our SG&A spend strategically, focusing on talent acquisition, workforce planning, balancing the bench and hiring functional management, who can bring value to our long-term sustainable growth strategy. GAAP income from operations growth was 2.1% year-over-year, representing 9.5% of revenue in the quarter. Non-GAAP income from operations for the quarter increased 14.6% over prior year to $49.3 million, representing 15.2% of revenue. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 17.3%, the lower-than-expected tax rate was a result of the adoption of the new pronouncement, which generated a greater than expected tax benefit to the higher level of exercised options. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate is 21.9%, which excludes the impact of this pronouncement. For the quarter, we generated $0.44 of GAAP EPS, which reflects a higher-than-expected stock compensation expense related to the increase in our stock price in addition to higher FX losses than planned. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.72 based on total shares outstanding for Q1 from approximately $53.9 million. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash from operations for Q1 was $31.2 million compared to $10.9 million in the same quarter last year. Free cash flow came in at $25.5 million, resulting in an adjusted net income conversion ratio of 65.5%. Total DSO was 77 days compared to 94 days in the same quarter last year. AR DSO was 49 days and our unbilled DSO was 28 days. We continue to be pleased with the improvements in these areas and would expect DSO to normalize in the low 80s during the fiscal 2017. Turning now to guidance. Revenue growth for fiscal 2017 reflects an updated foreign exchange headwinds assumption of 2% and revenue growth will now be at least 21%. We expect constant currency growth will continue to be at least 23%. We expect GAAP income from operations will continue to be in the range of 12% to 14% and non-GAAP income from operations will continue to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We expect our effective tax rate will continue to be at least 19%. For earnings per share, we continue to expect GAAP-diluted EPS will be at least $2.45 for the full year and non-GAAP EPS will continue to be at least $3.38 for the year. We expect weighted average share count of $54.8 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For Q2, revenue will be at least $340 million for the second quarter, reflecting a growth rate of at least 20% after 2% currency headwinds, meaning we expect constant currency growth will be at least 22%. For the second quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 11% to 12% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We expect our effective tax rate to be at least 19%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $0.55 and non-GAAP EPS to be at least $0.80 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 54.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding, a few key assumptions which support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock compensation expense is now expected to be approximately $14 million in Q2 and $12 million in each remaining quarter. Amortization of intangibles is now expected to be approximately $1.9 million in each remaining quarter. FX losses are now expected to be approximately $2 million for each quarter. And the tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments is now expected to be approximately $4.6 million in each remaining quarter. Lastly, with the recent adoption of ASU 2016-09, as a result of moment on our stock price, we expect future volatility in our effective tax rates and GAAP EPS. With that, let me finish with a few thoughts. As most of you know, this is my last earnings call with EPAM. I've enjoyed meeting many of you and appreciate your interest and the support in EPAM. I'm very proud of all the accomplishments, our employees and all the work that we do for our clients. While this will be my last earnings call, I will remain in EPAM working closely with my successor, Jason Peterson, for a smooth CFO transition as he takes on the role May 10. Thank you. And now let me turn the call back to Arkadiy.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Anthony. At this time, I'd like to thank you for your dedication, commitment and leadership over the last 10 years. Speaking on behalf of the global EPAM team, we wish you all the best in your future endeavors. That said, I think we're ready to take some questions. David?
David Straube: Thanks, Ark. I'd like to ask that each of you keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to participate. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call, please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Moshe Katri of Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Moshe Katri: Hey guys, thanks. Good solid start for the year. Can we just get some color on what sort of assumptions that we have in the model right now for the year in terms of pricing and then wage inflation, these are the two assumptions. And then, as a follow-up, what should we expect for UBS and then the dilution from the India-based acquisition this year?
Anthony Conte: Sure. Pricing, basically, we're seeing kind of stable pricing in line with the expectations and what we've seen over the past couple of years. So no real change in our pricing assumptions from anything we've discussed in the past. And wage inflation, we are talking about approximately 4% is the wage inflation figure that we were figuring in for the year.
Moshe Katri: Yes. And then…
Anthony Conte: And then, Moshe, what was the second half of that question?
Moshe Katri: What should we look for UBS this year. You said it was slightly up sequentially. And then are we getting to that inflection point where the dilution from India kind of subsides or not yet?
Anthony Conte: We don't give specific guidance on any clients. So we're not really giving any specific guidance around UBS. And as far as India...
Arkadiy Dobkin: So India, like Indian part already taken in account in our guidance, so I don't think we can add anything. So we're working together with growing accounts and bringing services from India brought into to EPAM, but I don't think we can give any specifics or numbers or whatever.
Anthony Conte: It's all baked into our model and our guidance.
Moshe Katri: Alright. Thanks, Anthony and good luck.
Anthony Conte: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Anil Doradla, William Blair. Please go ahead.
Anil Doradla: Hey guys, congrats from my side too. So one big picture question, Arkadiy and Anthony; you started off a good quarter. Sounds like the tone is pretty positive, why not raise the full year guidance on the top line?
Arkadiy Dobkin: First of all, as you can see, we have this quarter positive impacts from FX and its part of our revenue -- our overall performance. Second, it's still beginning of the year. It's still enough of volatility in the market. It's still a lot of unknown and that's exactly what we're comfortable at this point to guide. So nothing else.
Anil Doradla: So just a degree of conservativeness and you just want to see how the year plays out?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It's our regular degree of being realistic, so let's not talk about conservative at this point.
Anthony Conte: And just to point out, the Q1 over performed, Anil, is really only 1.5%. So you're not talking about, if you exclude the currency, you're not talking about a huge over perform that would drive some really higher expectations for the full year beyond what we've already put in there.
Anil Doradla: And as a follow-up, Arkadiy, UBS seems to be stabilizing, at least that's what you said. If I heard correctly, you saw a little sequential growth. Now, what is the visibility into UBS for the year? Do you think the business -- you have more visibility now, what gives you confidence that this has stabilized at this stage?
Arkadiy Dobkin: First of all, all we can share on UBS in more or less certain terms, is that what we shared in press release when we said about our $300 million plus contract over the next three years. This has worked more or less certain. So right now, we do believe that the account stabilized because we're seeing like that we're not dropping revenue anymore, and we have some good visibility. But at the same time, let's not forget that last year, all this happened just in one month, and we were thinking about one scenario for H2, and then this happened, completely different scenario. So that's why I'm reporting back to being realistic at this point at this stage of the -- phase of the year.
Anil Doradla: Alright, good. And congrats and Anthony, best of luck on the next feat.
Anthony Conte: Thank you, Anil.
Operator: The next question is from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Michael Reid: Hi, this is Mike Reid, on for Joe. Thanks for taking our question. Did you give the client concentration this period for the top clients or UBS?
Anthony Conte: We did not. UBS is now below 10%, so it's not a disclosable item. So we're not going to be talking about that top concentration or any concentration below 10%.
Michael Reid: Okay. And then the next two levels, 5% and 10%, look like they went up a little bit during the period. Is that due to just a little bit of growth in those clients or just -- were there other things involved there?
Anthony Conte: Really just little bit of growth in those clients. And it wasn't that significant of a move. So moderate growth in there.
Michael Reid: Okay. One last one, if you don't mind. The headcount was barely up from the previous period, is that signaling anything or is that just kind of showing that you're getting the workforce better re-optimized and better utilization?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It's definitely second. And we talked about it during the last two calls that we were a little bit light on utilization. So we're just bringing this to normal state.
Michael Reid: Okay. Great, thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Arvind Ramnani of Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.
Arvind Ramnani: Thanks. I appreciate you taking the question. Clearly, very good results for Q1, really good beat on revenues. Can I ask what you had may have already partially answered, but in the second half, are you expecting any specific headwinds from UBS or anything else? And also kind of what kind of pricing uplift have you baked into your guidance?
Anthony Conte: There is nothing specific that we can kind of talk about in the second half, as Ark said. There's still obviously -- we are looking out. And as you look at the second half of the year, there are still some uncertainties out there, so we're comfortable with the guidance that we put out. We're not guiding to any specific accounts. And as far as pricing, what I said earlier was that we're seeing basically stable pricing with a little bit of modest uptick in line with what we've seen in the past couple of years.
Arvind Ramnani: My follow-up is for the kind of second quarter guide, kind of what operating margin have you assumed in the at least $0.80 EPS guidance?
Anthony Conte: For second quarter, the guide for operating margin was 16% to 17%.
Arvind Ramnani: Okay. Great. Anthony, it's been really good working with you. Good luck and I hope you can -- I mean, continue to stay in touch.
Anthony Conte: Very good. Thank you. I hope so as well.
Arvind Ramnani: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Please go ahead.
Benjamin Wilson: Het guys, thanks for taking the question. This is Ben, in for Steve this morning. Maybe just one for me, Anthony, on the margin front. Kind of what are your expectations from here going forward. I guess, it was lower than it typically is in margin. What takes the margin from here, what are the factors that we should be thinking about?
Anthony Conte: Are you looking at operating margin, just so I'm clear with the margin we're addressing?
Benjamin Wilson: Operating margin.
Anthony Conte: Well, I mean operating margin in Q1 was -- it was in range. I mean, we had guided Q1 to be between 15% and 16%, and it was a little bit lower in that range mainly because of the unexpected expense that we mentioned, roughly $1.9 million construction-related expense. So other than that, we guided for Q2 to be in the 16% to 17% range, and for the full year, we still expect it to be in kind of the 16% to 18% range. So really we're not seeing any change beyond what we expected. And Q1 was, yes, a little bit lower in the range than we thought.
Benjamin Wilson: Okay. And just on the utilization side; would you characterize that as being kind of fixed and in a place where you're happy with going forward?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, I think, we're in the range which we were talking about. And we'll try to maintain as much as possible with the regular volatility, ability [ph] and all of this.
Benjamin Wilson: Alright, thanks. And good luck Anthony.
Anthony Conte: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Avishai Kantor of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Avishai Kantor: Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So you're saying that you continue to invest in your consulting capabilities. What type of consultants you are really referring to? Are you talking about Accenture type management strategy consultants or more like digital technology consultants?
Arkadiy Dobkin: We're talking about business consultancy, which means like industry knowledge and understanding. And we're talking about both digital consultancy and technology consultancy, which we definitely need to bring to higher improved levels.
Avishai Kantor: Okay. And my follow-up question, with all the large Tier 1 Indian offshore vendors saying that they're planning to increase their presence in the U.S., any signs of wage inflation or -- coming out from that?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Not at this point, but at the same time, again, that's exactly what we don't know.
Avishai Kantor: Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Alex Veytsman of Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Please go ahead.
Alexander Veytsman: Yes, hello, good morning guys. Thank you for taking my questions and best of luck to Anthony. I just wanted to understand the trends for the financial services throughout the year. Obviously, you guys mentioned UBS, there's Barclays out there, which was also kind of sort of flat lately. Could you help us understand what the trajectory is for the remaining few quarters of the year?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think, it would be similar to what we're seeing right now. We still have a lot of opportunities around this account, but again, it's very difficult to predict what would happen. And there are a lot of opportunities around the second line of our account in financial services and some technology companies plan in tech area as well. So we're optimistic on this, and as you see the result effect of UBS. We're very close to 20% growth there.
Alexander Veytsman: That's helpful. And then can you update us on your labor sourcing trends in Eastern Europe right now? If that's been decreasing in Ukrainian dollars or potentially increasing in other regions. What are the latest dynamics there as far as your -- with your engineers?
Arkadiy Dobkin: We don't see, right now, any specific differences from what we were seeing during the last several years. So -- and we expect it will be very much in line with those previous trends -- we don't know again. That's again one of the unknown in the future.
Alexander Veytsman: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Vladimir Bespalov of VTB Capital. Please go ahead.
Vladimir Bespalov: Hello, congratulations on good growth. I have a couple of questions today. The first is basically on your cash position, which is pretty large share, how you're going to use it? And are there any M&A deals in the pipeline, if you could tell us about. And the second one is, on your SG&A expenses. The growth appears to be quite significant. So how should we look at this expense going forward?
Anthony Conte: Cash, yes, the primary purpose for the cash buildup is for M&A. And we do have a pipeline of M&A deals that we're looking at. Nothing obviously, I can specifically talk about. But we do have a pretty robust pipeline of deals. And the second part of the question on SG&A. The first quarter, it was a little bit higher. We had a $1.9 million expense hit SG&A. That was an unplanned and unforeseen expense that pushed us up -- pushes up about half a percent -- little more than half a percent of revenue when you look at SG&A. So that is not going to be recurring. So we will continue to focus on managing SG&A and continue to bring that down as a percentage of revenue, is our main focus.
Vladimir Bespalov: Okay, thank you.
Anthony Conte: Pleasure.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Jamie Friedman of Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.
James Friedman: Arkadiy, a question we get a lot and we don't know how to answer, so I have to ask you. Could you give us some perspective as to where we are in the digital journey. How do you measure that? How would you know if it was ending? What's the client appetite look like for digital purchases?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I'm not sure I can make a picture more clear for you. But in general, it's definitely what's driving the growth. There are lot of hungriness for delivery of good transformational digital services. And for us, it's clearly an area of focus. We have a number of internal metrics which we're testing, hard to measure this, but it's not -- it's a very fragile line for everybody. So -- and on the kind of operational front, we're trying to improve our capability in front offices, and we're putting a lot of efforts to integrate them with our engineering capabilities because we really believe that's what brings the differentiation for us. It's a strong digital transformation of UX skills, together with engineering of complex solutions. And we're trying to get consultancy for components on top of it. But I think, it's a very generic answer, which you probably would expect.
James Friedman: Yes. And Jason, I was just wondering if you could share with us, I know its early days on the job, but your last job worked out pretty well. What do you see as the, I guess to out phrase it generally, what is that attracted you to EPAM, what sort of skill sets do you think that you can bring to enhance their operations?
Jason Peterson: As you indicated, I'm still counting my time in weeks rather than months. As to why I came to EPAM, Cognizant is a really good company, but there is just something really exciting about EPAM. As Ark was talking about here, you've got the software heritage, you've got the focus on digital engagement. So the company just really has strong capabilities and you sense that, even in your first couple of weeks on the job. So you got the opportunity to address these growing markets and demand trend and business transformation, and it just looks like it's a really exciting place to be. From an experience standpoint, there's a lot of ways to get to high-growth. EPAM has obviously shown that it has got a lot of capabilities in that area. As you indicated, I bring my experience from Cognizant. I've been there for -- was there for about nine years in various finance roles; before that, I worked for a series of technology companies in Silicon Valley. So I bring some interesting perspectives as well.
James Friedman: Thank you. And best of luck Anthony. Thank you.
Anthony Conte: Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you. We look forward to seeing you all at our scheduled Annual Investor Day, on May 9, in New York City. And thanks for attending today's call. And if you have any questions, David here always to help. And one more time, thank you to Anthony and good luck.
Anthony Conte: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the EPAM Systems Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now pleasure to introduce your host Mr. David Straube, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Straube, you may begin.
David Straube: Thank you operator and good morning everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company’s fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results. If you have not, a copy is available at epam.com in the Investor section. With me on today’s call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Anthony Conte, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today’s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company’s earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP numbers have been reconcile to GAAP and are available in our Investor Relations materials in the Investor section of our website. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you David and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. I would like to start from a simple remainder that last week [indiscernible] opportunity to come back to New York stock exchange to celebrate the 5th Anniversary of our IPO and to ring the closing bell. We are proud to see today five years later that we have been able to negotiate successfully many challenges during that period. Moreover, to bring continuously significant value to our clients and some results to demonstrate year-after-year strong growth despite geopolitical uncertainties, economic instabilities and massive global competitors who just started to notice EPAM brand recently. EPAM changed a lot during the past five years, we have more than tripled the company size, significantly expanded our horizontal and vertical capabilities and started global diversification of our delivery locations. We also invest into developing mainly needed corporate functions that practically didn’t exists by [indiscernible]. So at this point, I would like to state that today five years later, we are very confident the EPAM is in much better position to continue growing than we ever been before. [indiscernible] into the past, we feel especially [indiscernible] to report during the last year, we reached quite a milestone, we could only dream about in 2012. Our annual 2016 revenue crossed the billion mark and reached 1.16 billion, which correspond into 26.9 year-over-year growth, but 29.4% in constant currency terms. And in addition, [indiscernible] even more important represent 24% organic growth in constant currency. Let us move in more details with what happened with EPAM in 2016. Now let’s start some delivery capabilities. In 2016 while traditionally benefiting from our strong [indiscernible] expertise. We continuously focused on investing into the quality of our technology practices, engineering productivity, industry accelerator, maturity of our delivery processes and tools. The overall goal was not only to maintain our advantage in that area, but also to differentiate [indiscernible] against growing competitors with our ability to engineer and deliver successfully company’s products and solutions, the Shanghai demand crossed our strategically targeted markets. During 2016, we continue to make sure our digital and data capabilities as well. We are specifically, we are focusing on the capabilities with our core engineering and technology practices. That allow us to deliver to our customers much more programs in comparison with the past ranging from our commercial software project development to digital end-to-end platforms and now to business in digital strategic executions. And confirmation for that, we would like to share during the last year we have one six customer innovation awards in partnership with several of our top clients [Indiscernible] one of the top digital agencies in Europe. [Indiscernible] has also been recognized in our 60 industry analysts reports for our increasingly comprehensive capabilities in driving agile digital transformation across all of our key verticals. In fact, we were named the leader in digital platform, engineering services for a survey of Digital Platform Engineering Services in Q2 2016. Lastly, in 2016, we continued to expand our global delivery footprint which brought very important hands on experience in several new geographies and allowed us much better understand how to integrate and develop from one side and [indiscernible] benefit from another such new global delivery within EPAM and within our clients. Now, moving to our vertical performance. For 2016, we had very strong growth across three of our six industry verticals included in Media and Entertainment, Life Science and Healthcare and Emerging Verticals, which all grew over 40% We see very promising opportunities across all of those segments, where we present already at a good number of portion and companies, but still only at the initial stages of potentially significant growth during this year. Financial services finished the year with 17% growth, which reflected a Q4 growth of 4.6%. It’s important to note that with the effect of UBS our growth in Q4 would be 21.2% and over 30% for the full-year and reported currency, which represents a very healthy growth of this segment across Europe, North America and Asia. Travel and Consumer finished the year at 20.5%, which reflected a Q4 growth rate of 10.8%. We attribute this temporary slowdown to currency impact in Euro Zone approximately 5% global impact. [Indiscernible] retailers and consumer brands to show positive returns investment in digital. And in addition to the completion of significant milestones in multi-year products at two of our clients. As we expand our capabilities in this segment, we expect to be able to delivering innovative solution not only in platforms, but also in business model including helping our customers address digital disruption and to support our over 20% growth here in the long run. Lastly, our traditionally strong software and hi-tech portfolio grew respectfully 23% for the year, which allow us to this important segment strategic target of 20% [indiscernible]. Overall, in 2016, the specification of our concentration continues to run positive trend. For the year, our growth rate outside the top 20 accounts was 44.3% growth in the top 20 was 12.5%. Turning to our people and talent development, we very well recognized the simple fact that we have to continuously investing in our people to stay relevant on the market. Simply put the commitment to talent is single biggest factor in our sustained growth. In the end of 2016, we brought onboard a very senior HR and talent leadership team to elevate our [indiscernible] client management and engagement functions new roles. This also should allow us [indiscernible] into much more growth environment with diverse multi-cultural talent and in turn well position the company to hiring new highly skilled multi-disciplinary hybrid teams capable for all of the most complete technology challenges and delivering the most innovative industry solutions. In addition, we were continually innovating in our internal employee engagement software system as well as in engineering for more [indiscernible] tools and practices. We also invested significantly in 2016 in [indiscernible] internal training initiatives through network of collaborative global events as well as in person and online courses. With the result of all the surplus, we believe that EPAM today is much better positioned to continue hiring and developing our global talent. Specific to headcount in Q4 we ended with over 19,680 professionals which is 22% increase year-over-year. Before I turn the call to Anthony for the update on our financials and 2017 outlook, let me cover a few other tactics which weren't focusing during our previous update three months ago. First of all UBS concern, in January we announced strategic agreements with UBS which extends our nine year relationship with them for the next three years. This agreement which is well at more than $300 million allows EPAM to continue focusing on innovative end-to-end solutions and should help our client to reduce time-to-market and improve the ROI and technology investments. Utilization concerns. We certainly have significant progress and improving our utilization since last quarter. Finishing Q4 at 75.9% which is almost 4% improvement in comparison to Q3. We still are not at the level where we would like to be, but we are very confident in our ability to get into more normalized level in the first half of 2017. With that, let me turn it over to Anthony for detailed financial update for 2016 and our 2017 guidance.
Anthony Conte: Thank you Ark and good morning everyone. I will start with some financial highlights talk about profitability, cash flow and end on guidance. As Ark mentioned, we are pleased with the quarter having delivered strong top-line performance, generated significant free cash flow and improved our utilization. Here are few key highlights from the quarter. Revenue closed at $313.5 million 20.5% over our fourth quarter of last year and 5.1% sequential which represents a year-over-year constant currency growth of 22.8% and organic constant currently growth of 20%. From a geographic perspective, North America our largest region representing 58.7% of our Q4 revenues grew 26.8% year-over-year. Europe representing 33.9% of our Q4 revenue grew 12.3% year-over-year or 19.3% in constant currency. CIS grew 14.4% year-over-year and now represents 4.2% of revenue and finally APAC decreased 2.8% and now represents 2% of our revenue. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 36.8%, compared to 39.2% for the same quarter last year. The primary driver for this decrease was utilization, which ended at 75.9%, compared to 78.8% in the same quarter last year. But it was an improvement from the 2% in Q3 of this fiscal year. Utilization this quarter reflects our continued efforts in balancing supply and demand across our business. Non-GAAP SG&A, which excludes stock compensation expense in certain other items came in at 20.2%, compared to 21.3% in the same period last year. We continue to leverage our SG&A expense strategically focus on talent acquisition, workforce planning, balancing the bench and hiring functional management to bring value to our long-term sustainable growth strategy. GAAP income from operations increased 17.7% year-over-year to represent 11.9% of revenue in the quarter. Non-GAAP income from operations for the quarter increased 9.7% over prior year to 51.5 million representing 16.4% of revenue. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 22.7% driven by a shift in geographic mix of revenues. And for the quarter we generated $0.46 of GAAP EPS and $0.77 of non-GAAP EPS, which reflects the tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments and is based on approximately 53.4 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash from operations for Q4 was 53.7 million, compared to 11.8 million in the same quarter last year. Free cash flows came in at 44.3 million, resulting in adjusted net income conversion ratio of 108%. Our strong quarterly performance and ongoing DSO improvements were the primary factors in the strong free cash flow performance. This quarter our AR DSO was 59 days and our unbilled DSO is 18 days for a total of 77 days, compared to a total of 95 days in the same quarter last year, which is driving most of the cash flow improvements. We continue to be pleased with improvements in this area, I won’t expect DSO to normalized in the low-80s during fiscal 2017. Let me some up or we finish the fiscal year. Revenues for the fiscal year closed at 1.16 billion or 26.9% growth over 2015, which represented a constant currency growth rate of 29.4% and makes fiscal 2016 a milestone year for EPAM having crossed the 1 billion revenue mark. Organic constant currency growth for the full-year is 24% further demonstrating our ability to drive growth through an ongoing challenging marketplace. GAAP income from operations increased 26.2% year-over-year to represent 11.5% of revenue for the year. Our non-GAAP income from operations increased 20.9% over prior year to 191.8 million, representing 16.5% of revenue. Our effective tax rate for the year came in at 21.5% and we generated $1.87 of GAAP EPS and $2.90 of non-GAAP EPS, which reflects the tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments and is based on approximately 53.2 million diluted shares outstanding. Cash from operations for was 164.8 million, compared to 76.4 million for fiscal 2015 and free cash flow came in at 135.5 million or 88% adjusted net income conversion. Turning now to the guidance. Revenue growth for fiscal 2017 will be at least 20% after factoring in about 3% estimated currency headwinds. Meaning we expect constant currency growth will be at least 23%. We expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 12% to 14% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We expect our effective tax rate to be at least 19%. This reflects the adoption of the stock-based compensation pronouncement, ASU 2016-09, which will be effective January 1, 2017. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $2.45 for the full-year and non-GAAP EPS will be at least $3.38 for the full-year. We expect weighted average share count of 54.8 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For Q1 of fiscal 2017, revenues will be at least $315 million, reflecting a growth rate of at least 19% after 3% currency headwinds, meaning, we expect constant-currency growth will be at least 22%. For the first quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 10% to 11% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 15% to 16%. We expect our effective tax rate to be at least 20%. And for earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $0.49 for the quarter and non-GAAP EPS will be at least $0.72 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 53.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding. And finally, a few key assumptions which support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock compensation expense is expected to be around $55.4 million with $13.4 million in Q1 and $14 million in each remaining quarter. Amortization of intangibles will be about $7.5 million or about $1.9 million per quarter. FX assumptions is expected to be around $7 million loss for the year with $1.6 million in Q1 and $1.8 million in each remaining quarter. The tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be $18.8 million for the year with $4.2 million in Q1 and $4.9 million in each remaining quarter. With that, let me turn the call back to Ark.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Anthony. A few points before we turn to Q&A. Our 2017 outlook reflects the continuous strong demand for our services. We should expect the markets that we serve to be disrupted and go through the natural cycles. At the same time, we are very confident that our strategy of combining our traditional technology and engineering advantage. This proven capabilities in digital transformation, design and emerging consultancy should enable EPAM to mitigate those events responsibly and to drive results from a business which has very solid fundamentals in our view with industry leading growth rates. With that, let me turn the call back to operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Anthony Conte: Darrin are you on mute?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Hi, I was wondering, Ark, if you could provide an update on what you had talked about with regards to supply demand mismatch on a 3Q call. From your guidance, it seems like it will still have some impact into 1Q and then it should be life as normal. So part of the question is to get that update part of it is what can you do in the future so that this sort of thing may not happen?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. So thank you asking for question. So I will remind what you were shared in last quarter. The mismatch was mostly driven by two components. One of them was UBS change in plans for their future growth and our preparedness to provide services and basically hiring people in specific locations for this client. And the second was our integration processes in the years and kind of our new experience at the rate operate in the new geography. And between this two, basically it was a mismatch and we decided not to do any reduction in headcount, because we know that we continue growing. There is relatively pretty strong demand and we don't need to hire a people like one quarter later anyway. So we decided to stay at this and continuing to invest in the talent. So that was the mismatch which started to happen actually not even last quarter but second part of the last year. As we mentioned already today, versus Q3, Q4 actually was performing practically 4% better on utilization. At the same time, it will take probably another quarter to get to normal or maybe even two quarters, so it's very difficult to predict. But definitely there is a right approach. How to eliminate this kind things in the future, that's much more difficult equation, because sometimes not necessarily it completely difference on us, there is some level of unpredictability in client situation in the market. And being honest, this type of thing will happen in any the part of world. There is relatively volatile kind of history in utilization depends on some client. When it's a biggest client it' s more noticeable, but on another side as we mentioned we are paying much more attention to this, this is another lesson for us. And we also brought additional experienced people from outside who were dealing with this in the past on bigger scale. And we hope that we will be managing this as much more closely right now. So that's all I can share.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: No that's good thank you. And then the other question I had actually one of the number of questions so let me quickly ask it with regards to for free cash flow, should we expect roughly 90% conversion rate again this year? But with regards to [indiscernible], I noticed that there is a lot of healthcare related hiring and capability improvement in your base at the EPAM to some of my checks. I was just wondering, if you can give us an update on the particular vertical?
Arkadiy Dobkin: You mean in like life science and healthcare?
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Correct yes.
Arkadiy Dobkin: We are pretty optimistic about this when we started like two years ago. And as we said today its growing pretty strongly right now in excess of 40%. So at the same time it’s relatively small, because life science and healthcare only 10% of our business today. But we definitely very interesting in this sector and we are planning to invest product. So we build in additional expertise, we build like considering to build some consultancy around it. So all I can say, we think it’s one of the growth area for us.
Anthony Conte: And your question on cash flow at the beginning. We don’t give specific guidance at this point around cash flow or cash flow conversion. Clearly 2016 saw improvement, some of that improvement was driven by or most of that improvement was driven by the improvements in the DSO. So we had some pick-up in 2016 that was recovery from kind of late 2015. We are working to stabilize and normalize DSO and maybe at some point in the future, we can talk about guidance around that number. But at this point, we are just issuing kind of DSO guide, which is kind of to be in the low-80s is where we expect and we are feeling out cash flow and then possibly sometime in the future we can talk about guidance around free cash flows and conversion.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. Just wanted to start with the question around somebody underlying assumptions in the 2017 guidance. Specifically for pricing utilization and revenue growth at UBS?
Anthony Conte: Sure. Pricing we are anticipating pricing to be low single-digits I think 2% to 3% is roughly what we are putting in. That’s in constant currency and reported, it will most likely be zero or possibly less than zero based on what we see as far as the currency assumptions. As far as utilization, our guidance is the same, we are looking to get it back in range between 76% and 78%. So we need to get ourselves back into that range for the year. And we don’t provide specific guidance on customers. So for UBS, we are not giving any specific guidance there.
Arkadiy Dobkin: This will probably be deal clearly.
Anthony Conte: Right.
Jason Kupferberg: Are you anticipating any share loss within the UBS account?
Arkadiy Dobkin: All we can share is that we have this deal, which actually bring stability and predictability for us and actually [indiscernible]. How margin would go up, it’s very difficult to predict. Right now, It looks pretty stable and we are optimistic.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. And then just on the margin side, I mean I think the EPS in Q4 came up, just a hair below what you are targeting. It sounded like utilization came in about where you were expecting. You could have that nice quarter-over-quarter improvement. Anything else you would call out in margin that fell short of your expectations in Q4?
Anthony Conte: No. I mean, margins came in pretty close to what we were talking about last quarter. So nothing else was in there.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. And just last very quick for me. How much movement in the top 10 accounts was there during 2016? And what might you anticipate on that front in 2017, just given the way the client concentration is decreasing here?
Arkadiy Dobkin: In the movement, you mean what?
Jason Kupferberg: Well, in other words, if you look at your top 10 accounts in 2015, how many were still top 10 in 2016? And how many of those top 10 in 2016 are expected to still be top 10 in 2017? Or will there be some new high-growth accounts that will take the place of others in the top 10?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So there is a very, very relatively small volatility there. So basically, we might expect that two or three accounts from second dozen will go to the top 10, which is very normal. And we didn’t lose any accounts from this combination. But clearly, there is some replacement, it’s always happening like the kind of bottom two, three, four accounts as they kind of move in between top 20.
Anthony Conte: So nothing outside of the normal course. Every year, we have movement, and we don’t expect anything different in 2017.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. Thank you
Arkadiy Dobkin: I would like to comment because I think it would be multiple equations on concentration and top line. I just, again, would like to remind that, and kind of going back five years in 2012 when practically as we go there we are talking about Thomson Reuters. And just to remind us, the Thomson Reuters, at this time, was probably as big proportionately as UBS or maybe even bigger. And then the second largest client was probably two last time smaller than that and Thomson Reuters actually went out of our top five with the next several years, and we still we are growing and balancing. And again, just to remind that Thomson Reuters is now number three client back and a much bigger than was in 2012. What I mean that we have pretty good concentration, client concentration and balancing of this so with all this volatility, it's not the kind of the key worry for us.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. Thank you. That’s very helpful.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question.
James Friedman: Hi. Thank you for the incremental disclosures, Anthony, with some of the financials. I just wanted to ask, Ark, in some of your prepared remarks, I mean it, you were going kind of fast, but I think that you mentioned that you completed some milestones, there are two clients, I thought in the consumer vertical? Did I get that right? Or could you repeat what you said about that? You used the word milestones, if you could revisit that for me?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yeah, what I mentioned is in our view, very temporary slowdown in Retail and Consumer vertical was as a result of multiple reasons, and one of them was that we have two big programs which were finished.
James Friedman: Okay. So would you anticipate that projects return from those customers? Or are you moving on? How should we be thinking about that?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So these projects actually continues just kind of increase towards slowdown and kind of flatter position. Two programs which we potentially might start a new programs there or like new clients so that's why we considering this pretty temporary.
James Friedman: Got it. And then just maybe one more, I thought in your prepared remarks you called out media and entertainment, life science and emerging. If I could just ask if we were to overlay those verticals, because you had a big surge this is on page 19 in the slides, you don't have to look at. But it's one where the $10 million to $20 million account, you had a big surge in that category. As my question is how much of the opportunity in media, entertainment, life science emerging would we find and say the top accounts, I don't know top 10 or 20 accounts of the company?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we already discussed number of accounts several accounts which in our categorization will have to emerging or to life science, which is among the top 10, we have several of them. And in our view we are very fast in penetrating this accounts, there is a pretty good opportunity to grow there. And same like gross many life science accounts which very large forms where our budget share is very, very small still.
James Friedman: Got it.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we have very, very strong opportunity to grow those segments.
James Friedman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Darrin Peller: Thanks guys. Just a question first on the organic assumption versus inorganic in 2017. And I guess bigger picture question around the deal activity around tuck-ins specifically around digital capabilities you've always done. It's been a little slow on that front, so if you can touch on that high level what you're looking for and the things in the pipeline on that front as well? And then just a follow-up question as well please.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay I think first of all our guidance for 2017 it is an organic guidance so we expect to organically grow at least 20% and in the constant currency it's 23%. So now we operate at pretty strong organic growth so not assuming any acquisitions in this numbers. The second, I am not sure I have the comment that you mentioned that our digital not growing fast enough?
Anthony Conte: It was acquisition strategy around digital.
Darrin Peller: Yes and I guess on that note, now that you bring it out. You guys have called out there being something like 70% plus digital of your revenues before. Maybe if you can just confirm if that's if that right if you really ever talked upside that. And I guess as how much in terms of new acquisitions we could expect going forward given pure point organic is, the guidance is organic. It's been a little wide and you've seen a pretty good flow of your tuck in deals you got a deal bunch of the last two years. But really in the last I think the last year it's a little slower. So where are you on that now?
Anthony Conte: Yes. I mean our M&A strategy hasn't changed, 2016 was a light year, not for lack of working. I mean we have a pretty robust pipeline we went through a number of diligence processes through 2016 nothing just really came to provision and close for a variety of different reasons. So we are still looking pretty aggressively. We have a pretty healthy pipeline, looking for, again, capabilities, focus and looking for that tuck-in-type deals. So that, nothing has changed there. Ark, do you want to add?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Again, this is normal. So our, as Anthony mentioned, strategy is the same. When we are asked about acquisitions, plan and M&A, this is very binary. It's going to happen or not so, and very difficult to talk about [probabilities] (Ph). So we are looking for good opportunities and we have a pipeline. So
Darrin Peller: All right. And then, I appreciate that. And just a quick follow-up, on the topic of immigration reform, which obviously has been coming up a lot lately, you guys have touched on it being not as material for you or more manageable given the size of your numbers of H-1Bs. Again, can you just refresh us on where you stand on that? If let's say, hypothetically, the wage amount were to go up dramatically? Or any way, any other changes you could think of that's worth mentioning now would be helpful.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So first of all, we still think that it's too early to understand exactly the parameters of these changes. And it's kind of very speculative assumptions in any case. But in our case, we have a little bit over 100 people who is in H-1 from our probably 1,300 billable in renewals and consultants in United States. So a thousand people. So basically, it's less than 10%.
Darrin Peller: Okay. So I guess you could always manage that. In other words, whether it's through mixed shift, if you need to or other changes if need to be.
Arkadiy Dobkin: That’s right.
Darrin Peller: Okay. I will leave it that and go back from queue. Thanks guys.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
David Grossman: Thank you. Good morning. So I'm wondering if you could just help us understand the composition of the growth guidance for 2017. And what I mean by that, just look at the relative contribution of growth from the top five, top 10, top 20 and beyond and how that compares to prior years. And I realize that the UBS dynamic may be impacting that significantly, but beyond UBS, is there any other things we should think about in terms of where the source of growth will be in 2017?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Hi David. Yes. Clearly, UBS growth is going to be different than was in previous years, so this is probably not a surprise to anybody right now. So, at the same time, it would be very difficult to talk in parameters like top 10, top 20, top 30 because there is multiple dynamics between different clients. let me rephrase it. We have very strong client base in our top 100 clients, with multiple Fortune 1000 or Fortune 2000 clients where we have revenue from a couple million to $20 million, $30 million and penetration of this client base in comparison with our competitors is very, very low. So we have dozens of clients which could be double, triple in revenue from their budgeting kind of capabilities. And from capabilities of EPAM right now is services issue, weakened for a while. So I think we are pretty confident that we can grow 20-plus percent organically during the next years.
David Grossman: Right. So historically, when you've mix shifted away from the top clients, you've had a favorable margin impact. Should we expect the same thing as we migrate through the course of 2017?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I’m not sure that margin in part directly related to shifting from the top clients. And again, I just mentioned a couple of minutes ago, the history which was with us, like practically four years ago, when we were replacing Thomson Reuters, which was growing practically again, proportionately from their share of our total revenue and from growth perspective, and was a good account from margins point of view, when the shift happened we were be able to mitigate it. Yes, right now, we are practically 2.5 times, three times bigger than that, but proportions in similar and with our $1 billion revenue, which we proudly kind of – while talking today, we are still pretty small company in these series of market.
David Grossman: Right. So your margin assumption or your assumption of improving margin next year is primarily driven by the utilization number then?
Anthony Conte: Well, utilization will contribute definitely. So it was unusually low in 2016, so we will get some pick up from utilization which will help margins. But we also have to balance that against continued investments into the business and where we need to continue to support the growth.
Arkadiy Dobkin: David, main difference in margins in part versus today and three, four years ago is still going to be currency, because if you think what was happening with the pounds and euro versus several years ago and the base the currency base for our delivery locations, there is a challenge here. So this is the main impact to which we are seeing right now. And where you look kind of the predictability on how these currencies will play.
David Grossman: Right. Okay, got it. Thanks for that. And then, just quickly back to the you know this whole, kind of visa thing. Even though you’re not heavily dependent on visas, and I think, we all understand that there are strategic arguments for increasing U.S. staffing levels. I think this is a topic you have thought a lot about in the past, Ark. How was your thinking evolving on the topic? And what should we expect to see from you in the U.S. over the next 12 to 24 months, if any?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we also mentioned already today in our prepared notes that we are really focusing on how to bring EPAM to a more welcoming front for different type of people coming from different locations from different cultures. And, again, our investment in talent management and talent acquisition across North America and Europe, this is exactly the answer to your concern. We put it much stronger team for talent acquisition from local perspective. We are going to focus on this and to kind of address and manage this potential, potential risks. At the same time, like, we also need to, like EPAM, for example, historically, always has pretty low proportion of on-site versus [indiscernible] resources. We are strategically increasing this, but we are still very well positioned how to work in the global distributed world and still deliver very complex solutions without necessity to have massively staffed to on-site positions.
David Grossman: All right, very good. Thank you for that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Anil Doradla with William Blair.
Anil Doradla: Hey guys. A couple of questions, so a lot of questions and focus around on the 2017 guidance. So if I rephrase the question, Ark and Anthony, what would you say would be the top one or two challenges in achieving the 20% guidance?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think we have, again, in general, the business model in services is relatively simple. There is no miracles here, there is no assumption, unusual happening. At the same time, there are too many variables and too many parameters you have kind to of balance together. So I still do believe that all fundamentals are pretty strong. And challenge in 2017 would be the same challenges you have had in 2016 and 2015 and before and mainly in the future too, balancing between clients' demand and right talent in right places in right time. So this is the main challenge and everything else is variations of this. So clearly, currency and geopolitical issues, but we are living through this already for the last three years as a minimum. And if you think about it where EPAM originally coming from, so that was the challenge for the last 20 years. So I think nothing really new. We are really kind of responsibly and carefully managing what is happening, what we can manage and trying to address things very quickly when it's a more a surprise for us and less predictable. So I don't know what other [Technical Difficulty].
Anil Doradla: Well I was hoping that there's something more specific, but what you are saying is that it's just business as usual, the same issues are going to play out in 2017.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we do think that with our size of the company today and configuration of our capabilities and client demand, which we are seeing. There is a pretty, pretty good opportunity for us to grow. That's what we are very confident.
Anil Doradla: Right. And as a follow-up, when I look at the 2017 outlook, obviously hiring is going to be a big component. Any particular geographies that you are going to focus on as you build out the year?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So it's also pretty much in-line with our previous performance. We are still pretty optimistic about capabilities and ability to grow in Eastern Europe. We are improving our capabilities in India right now. China, for us, still mostly in market capabilities, what we do is, we started to do some delivery for global clients. And clearly, North America and Western Europe would be a focus for us. We are still planning to increase proportion of in-market resources. So that would be our focus area. And again, we already comment on this.
Anil Doradla: Very good. Best of luck in 2017 guys.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Joseph Foresi: Hi. Can you provide an update on spending in financial services, that particular vertical? Any impact or change given some of the political changes in either Europe or the U.S.?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we have provided some comments like in our remark earlier today, where we gave the number, our percentage of growth for the vertical results without UBS. And this is a pretty strong number taking into account that it's not even accounted for FX headwinds so, because without UBS, I think it was a 22% growth without the currency impact. We think it's still pretty, strong. With all, as you mentioned, geopolitical impact and some things, which we cannot predict. We are optimistic about it, we also invested in a lot in special competency including like payments and work share and experimenting with is and having the first projects and actually some of them pretty light. So we are optimistic that we will find the opportunity to grow in line with our total expectations.
Joseph Foresi: Okay. And then on UBS, I know you are not giving client-specific guidance, but any concessions that were given when you signed the three-year deal? I guess I'm concerned maybe more on the pricing side, whether discount is given for a minimum volume commitments, things like that that you could provide us with?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I can say that our expectation's pretty balanced with our historical metrics around this account, okay? So clearly, there are more complex deals there but I think it's given flexibility to those parts, and we are very optimistic from the point of view that with the level and quality of the services we provide for stability which we have now would benefit us in the future.
Joseph Foresi: Okay. And then last one for me. On the labor side, any trouble finding talent at this point? I think you remain fairly concentrated in Eastern Europe. And how do wage increases and attrition look like in that region at this point?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Again, this is exactly like fundamental equation for our business, and we probably answered this in each call. And my traditional answer would be that there is nothing new and challenging to bring being talent to the company. This is a growing challenge for the last probably 20 years, it started like from before that comp situation and it's a global challenge. So it's not just about Eastern Europe, it's about Silicon Valley and East Coast, U.S. and London, but we are investing heavily in trainings. We are investing heavily in education and internal people. We expanded during the last several years our geographical footprint. So we are addressing these challenges as you can see during the last five years, and we are pretty comfortable with our current base of only 20,000 people, comfortable in comparison with many of our bigger competitors that we would be able to handle this challenge.
Joseph Foresi: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Steven Milunovich: You mentioned that your pricing will be fairly flat this year. What is going on with wages? And are you going to see some margin pressure if wages have to go up?
Anthony Conte: Yes. Actually, wage inflation is targeted around the same range. We are looking at right now just under 3% wage inflation globally. And that's in constant currency, so we do expect to see some benefit from currency. So right now, it’s looking at least, based on our planning, pricing and wage inflation are fairly balanced.
Steven Milunovich: And any update on the CFO search?
Anthony Conte: We are in the midst of the search, we are making some progress, we are seeing a number of candidates, and we are just betting the candidates in the pipeline. So nothing more to update at this point.
Steven Milunovich: All right. And then finally on the marketing side, this used to be almost a word-of-mouth business, but kind of what’s of evolved in terms of maturing your sales and marketing effort?
Arkadiy Dobkin: First of all, I do believe that word-of-mouth in services business is not a bad thing because we would like need to have like thousand clients, we need to have three, four hundred very good ones. So on another side, clearly, I hope it’s visible for those who are following us for some time how marketing function changed. How our kind of analyst recognition changed during the last several years. Now our brand is pretty well known. The same is happening in this business development function as well. But combination of referrals and actually markets in Forrester and Gartner, this is all a probably very strong sign of change happening.
Steven Milunovich: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Georgios Kertsos with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question.
Georgios Kertsos: Yes, hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Most of my questions have been answered. I have three very quick ones, hopefully. So the first one…
Arkadiy Dobkin: Can you speak up, please.
Anthony Conte: We can’t hear you.
Georgios Kertsos: Can you hear me now?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes.
Anthony Conte: Yes.
Georgios Kertsos: So a couple of quick ones from me, if I may. So first one, apology if I missed this. How much of the UBS contract is actually factored in into the FY 2017 guidance? Is this something you can share?
Anthony Conte: How much? I mean, so full contract factored in terms of guidance, and our expectations for the clients is all baked into the guidance. Not sure I understand the question.
Georgios Kertsos: Yes, yes. So basically, I’m trying to get a feel of what part of the FY 2017 guidance comes from UBS and what part comes from outside UBS account?
Anthony Conte: We don’t separate that.
Georgios Kertsos: Okay, clear. I was hoping to get your thoughts around the pricing environment, and I know that this has been sort of touched upon from other call from a couple of other guys. But if we sort of ex out utilization and normalize it, would you expect the gross margins to be relatively stable? Or do you see any sort of underlying sort of pricing/salary inflation dynamics playing out? So the question is, excluding staff utilization’s ups and downs, normalizing for that, would you expect the gross margin to be relatively flat year-on-year?
Anthony Conte: The answer is yes. I would expect to see stability. Right now, based on the pricing environment and wage inflation, we are seeing those two being fairly balanced and allowing us to keep our gross margin stable absent utilization moves.
Georgios Kertsos: Okay, clear. And last one from me. I was hoping if you could comment a little bit around the potential impact of to the EPAM’s effective tax rate if we were to see a change in the U.S. corporate tax rate. So how would that, basically is likely to affect your group effective tax rate? I know it’s very much a guesstimate at the moment, but then people are talking about streaming the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% or even 15%. I’m just trying to get a feel of what that would do to your numbers.
Anthony Conte: It's very hard to say. I mean everything right now is completely speculative, so it's really hard to assess or predict what that impact would be on our business at this point. We are watching the topic. We have seen a number of the proposals and all I can say is, at this stage, it's much too early to really assess what that impact would be.
Georgios Kertsos: Okay clear. That's all from me.
David Straube: Operator, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Avishai Kantor with Cowen.
Avishai Kantor: Yes, hi. Good morning. My first question is how much of your scope in financial services is related to regulatory and compliance work? And what could be the effect from a potential deregulation? And then my second question, will the rate of shifting billable employees between delivery and location change in 2017?
Anthony Conte: On the regulatory piece, about 20% is regulatory and we are not anticipating really any dramatic shift based on the visibility we have right now in that aspect of the business. And I'm sorry, can you repeat the second part of the question?
Avishai Kantor: Will the rate of shifting existing billable employees between delivery and locations change in 2017?
Arkadiy Dobkin: You mean like how aggressive any type of relocation program for people from one country to another or something like this?
Avishai Kantor: Exactly.
Arkadiy Dobkin: No. There is no any shift and it wasn't aggressive and important in the history as well so. In our case.
Avishai Kantor: That answers my question. Thank you so much.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Dobkin for closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So first of all, we look forward to seeing you at our Annual Investor and Analyst Day on March 14th in New York City. So just would like to confirm in general that we are pretty confident, and I think we addressed [indiscernible] questions. And thanks for attending today's call and if you have any questions, David should be able to help. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now pleasure to introduce your Ms. Lilya Chernova. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Lilya Chernova: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Right now you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2016 results. If you have not, a copy is available in the Investors section on our website at epam.com.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company’s earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Arkadiy?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Lilya. And good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Today we are pleased to share our results for Q3 climbing revenues $298.3 million in revenue, which is up 26.4% over third quarter last year and 28.7% growth in constant currency and 6.2% sequentially. Last time we talked about some demand and pricing changes in the market in our anticipation of some level downstream affect several BFSI accounts and few consumer clients. Today we can say that along with our industry peers we continue to experience some level of unpredictability due Brexit situation, which just in Q3 impacted our revenue by 2.3% due to currency headwinds on top of continued questions around this longer term impact. On another side, despite this general challenges everybody is talking about, we at EPAM have seen continued demand for our services. The demand which we see for complex technology solutions and business transformative services the deliveries were well balanced, consulting design, engineering integration and managed services gives us further confidence in our long-term strategy and our [indiscernible] to bring as anticipated really to our clients and in turn to continue to support our industry region revenue growth of over 20%. So Anthony will provide more detailed financial updates. But I want to share a several important Q3 highlights, which also would apply at large extend to our free cash for Q4 and for the full year. First, we continue to see more diversification in our client concentration, more so new acquisition but also through increased expansion in our existing clients fell outside of our top 20 accounts where we saw a 43% growth rate which is consistently higher than the overall company growth. Because of this our top 10 concentration grew by 5% to 37.6% from last year and now it’s up 20%, it’s down almost 6% to 48%. Turning to verticals. Media and entertainment delivery to a 40% growth and thus for the past four quarters primarily fueled by continued expansion with clients. Our imaging vertical which includes a variety of clients continued its strong growth as well up 56% year-over-year. Also as part of this emerging story, we are excited to partner with several leading private equity owners, we selected a pharma vendor in health portfolio company to drive life scale transformation program, as well as to enable high potential digital start up to scale. We believe that this partnership have good potential to grow as we demonstrate our value and expand to grow to higher proportion of this portfolio. As you can see, all of our vertical grew over 20% year-over-year with exception of travel and consumer which came in just under the as a result of deceleration of growth in two large and highly penetrated accounts. Last, the currency impact driven by several large detail accounts in the UK. Current share in fact we do see continued strong growth outside in our travel and consumer vertical, globally with a number of strategic accounts growing over 40% year-over-year. Overall, we look at this as a positive trend towards and better diversification which is in line with our longer term strategy of keeping a fair balance across our verticals which should allow us to continue generating topline growth, while mitigation risk could be impacted by over concentration in one or two specific markets. Looking to our global operations. We continue to invest significant resources in developing the right mix of delivery capabilities by hiring global teams of experts which have the skills needed to upgrade demand or less specific subset of the market which in the industry analyst view and in all you use as well. We will continue to grow faster than the rest. During Q3, our headcount came at over 19,000 IT professionals which is 36.2% year-over-year increase. There are several reasons for that. First of all, all in the year [indiscernible] was accelerating of several large scale clients including UBS in several newer locations. When they started to get indications the demands was going to be delayed they had already committed to hiring and in most cases hire a significant number of staff in anticipation of their ramp. Their ramp up eventually did not happen, in addition we had to continue acquiring locations committed to either growing accounts. In addition, during last quarter's we saw weaknesses in the growth prospects of some key years accounts, leading to lower than anticipated utilization and revenue in there is still new cost part of the client business. So we have to compensate partially as GAAP revenue in our already established locations, where you have to continue hiring the personnel. While in some cases we worked to partly address this lack by deploying people to different new client programs and others reelected to maintain this excess capacity in anticipation of newly wins over the next several quarters and focus on. All that led to imbalance in our utilization. In summary, overall utilization came in at 72% in Q3, which was lower than the sort of volume a year. At this point we expect to see continued utilization softness into Q4 and some locations and we work to clear the range and redeploy available capacity. All that clearly carries and follow EPS guidance adjustment and Anthony will go at more details on this strategy. As part of our voice to address the situation better, in the future, especially result continues commitment to build a true global company with expanded presence in over 25 countries. We recently strengthened our people and improve operations by bringing several new senior leaders to focus on our employee [indiscernible] and management and number of people management programs and platforms. Larry Solomon who will be leading this team has achieved people like us and very new role IT firm. Larry came to us after many years at Accenture, he served a number of people and senior management positions with the last three years being chief operating officer of Accenture. As I have said before, this is new investments in delivery capabilities in quality personal are critical to ensure that we are well-positioned to deliver on our commitment we have made to our employees and all customers, and this is also the strategic differentiators despite the current difficult business environment they will position us to take advantage of the opportunity that build certainly revenues themselves over the course of the next few quarterly. So in closing, we are productively managing our utilization and we are also seeing good progress on other key operational methods, including improvement in operating cash flow, working capital and lower attrition numbers. This is all continued program and focused investment in building our global delivery teams and platform, should enable us to continue to deliver 25% growth and to do so with no significant scale. With this, I turn it over to Anthony for detailed financial update.
Anthony Conte: Thank you, Ark and good morning everyone. I'll start with some financial highlights then profitability and cash flow and end on guidance. As you heard in Ark's comments, our growth strategy is engineered to deliver consistent sustainable results and we have trend in another strong performance in the third quarter. Here are a few key highlights. Revenue closed at $298.3 million, 26.4% over third quarter of last year and 6.2% sequentially, which represent a constant currency growth rate of 28.7%. Geographically, North America represents our largest region, representing 56.4% of our Q2 revenues, up 34.8% year-over-year. Europe was up 19.3% year-over-year and 25.6% in constant currency, representing 37% of Q3 revenue. APAC grew slightly and now represents 2.3% of our revenue and CIS is flat year-over-year. Turning to profitability, GAAP income from operations increased 22.1% year-over-year to represent a 11.4% of revenue in the quarter. Our non-GAAP income from operations for the quarter increased 19.9% over prior year to $49.7 million, representing 16.7% of revenue. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 21.3% and for the quarter we generated $0.49 of GAAP EPS and $0.76 of non-GAAP EPS, which includes the tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments and is based on approximately $53.9 million diluted shares outstanding. The utilization challenges continue to create pressures on our income from operations, and ultimately EPS. Utilization ended lower than anticipated at 72%. Our non-GAAP SG&A, which excludes all stock comp expense came in at 19.5%, which is slightly lower than last year. We continue to focus on leveraging our SG&A spend and executing our strategy to focus on talent acquisition, workforce planning, balancing the bench and hiring functional management who bring value to our long-term sustainable growth strategy. Our attrition remains low at 10.4%. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash from operations for Q3 was $61.8 million and 11% year-over-year increase. Free cash flows came in at $55 million or 136% of adjusted net income conversion. In addition to strong quarterly performance, the cash flow improvement can also be attributed to our decrease in our DSO. This quarter our AR DSO is 58 days and our unbilled DSO is 25 days for a total of 83 days, compared to Q2, 2016 total of 88 days. As we mentioned in past quarters, we would implement changes to improve our processes, which we clearly have. Our efforts have reduced unbilled DSO by 19% sequentially. We have a better process in place now, but can't predict of the Q3 levels will be sustainable. As we continue to work through additional enhancements we will keep you updated. Turning now to guidance. Following our comments about macro demand pressures in the industry, our current outlook for Q4 revenue is expected to be at least $310 million, which will result in full year revenue of $1.156 billion, an increase of 26.5% over prior year and constant currency growth of 29%. GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $0.54 for the quarter and $1.94 for the full-year. Non-GAAP EPS will be at least $0.78 for the quarter and $2.90 for the full-year and is based on a weighted average share count of $54.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding. The $0.11 GAAP EPS drop in guidance is attributed to the compounded effects of lower utilization across multiple quarters, combined with FX losses on assets held in foreign jurisdictions. The $0.07 non-GAAP drop in guidance is related exclusively to the utilization challenges. Now, I'll turn it back over to Arkadiy for some additional comments.
Arkadiy Dobkin: One more important comment. As we stated in our press release Anthony, while he will be staying with us through the third quarter of 2017. So it may be noted that he plans to resign as the company's Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer as end of this period. Anthony has been a key part of our growth and success over his 10 years with us. We really thankful for that and wish Anthony growth in the future as well. But just to make sure we are all on the same page, during the next quarters Anthony will continue to work and serve is capacity, assist us in our search which is successor and then help to ensure smooth transition. Now we can turn to Q&A part.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Maggie Nolan: Hi, guys. This is Maggie Nolan in for Anil. I was hoping that you could give us a little bit more color on the two travel [ph] request that you are seeing some softness at, as well as the adjustment your other top clients and the dynamics there?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we shared it our - several notes this morning that first of all there is impact on some financials services clients which we talked before and some trend [ph] in consumer which is not really noticeable. So I think certain is coming from again, just if you account, but it’s - will be account which we mentioned during the last call and…
Anthony Conte: We can't really mention the client if that's what you're looking for. I mean, there are two - we have two of our larger travel and consumer clients that are very fully penetrated, and you know we're starting to see just a little bit slow down in the growth rates for those two big accounts. But there's nothing concerning there except that you know, they reach kind of scale and a size where the growth is starting to slow down there. They are still growing just at a slower rate. And then when you look at the rest of the vertical there are number of up-and-coming account within the vertical. But they are still relatively new and they are not material at this stage to offset the slowdown we're seeing in the two fully penetrated account. So that that dynamic is what's hitting us now, we're still very confident around this vertical, and as these newer account start to really gain and build some traction we should see growth continue and get back up to the levels where we've seen in the past.
Maggie Nolan: Okay, great…
Anthony Conte: Does that help?
Maggie Nolan: Yes. That’s very helpful. Thank you. And then the other question I had is, how are you planning to address the utilization challenges moving forward and how is this going to impact your hiring plans over the next couple of quarters and keeping in mind that you obviously have spoken to the fact that you want to keep the long-term growth plan impact? Thanks, guys.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Since we also mentioned this topic already, but in general we felt some - some long-term planning for couple of accounts which didn’t realize and we have excessive capacity in very specific locations which we cannot utilize immediately and might take a decision but we are not going to rush, but opportunity and with additional training, while still continue hiring in locations where we plan to grow further account. So in result of this we got to situation where our utilization were all driven that we expected before. So at this point, we were planning to make right assignments for this extra capacity and bring these two levels which is in much more normal range for us which is probably 3%, 4% up. So when it is exactly going to happen it’s difficult to say, it probably will take us couple quarters, but that’s what we are planning right now. The good part of this that it’s pretty manageable process, it’s not like very specific situations which we cannot control, it just with our choice to invest in people during this period.
Maggie Nolan: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Steve Milunovich: Thank you. Could you tell us what the organic revenue growth was in the quarter and expectations for organic growth in the fourth quarter? The Alliance acquisition is lapping in November, I believe, is there anything else that’s lapping?
Anthony Conte: Nothing else lapping, so just AGS in Q3 organic was 21%, organic constant currency was about 23%.
Steve Milunovich: Okay. And I think Ark commented on expecting 20% plus growth going forward, is that is still reasonable expectation looking out for 12 to 24 months, based on the pipeline that you see you?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. We believe it’s pretty reasonable explanation and again, even this numbers impacted by the same reasons which you said it already today, including our utilization situation and some capacity and locations which we couldn’t immediately realize. So - but we believe that we will be able to continue growing 20% plus.
Steve Milunovich: Is there anything changing significantly, I'm sometimes asked about the Indian vendors and whether they're able to kind of move up the stack and acquire better software development skills and compete with you?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we feel the same way like we feel before. So market is to big specifically in the subset of the market where we play and I am pretty sure everybody improving, but I think it's impacting in general the opportunities for growth.
Steve Milunovich: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Amit Singh: Hi, guys. This is Amit Singh for Jason. Sorry to get back on this question again, but the utilization part, the long-term plans for certain client that you saw anything, didn’t realize, were these clients primarily in banking financial services sector and what does that mean for your revenue growth sort of next year, is this sort of the revenue that you were expecting to come next year that did not going to realize now?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, yes, it was mostly in financial services and that’s exactly what we're trying to communicate. Yes, it might be impacting us for the next several quarters, but we do believe that the market is strong enough specifically in the area in which we play and that would allow us to grow 20 plus percent, that’s exactly our message. So how specific clients we'll be having during the next quarter or two or next 12 months it's very difficult to predict. We're not relying on specific clients, just probably talking about diversification from client balancing, concentration, specific verticals in which we play and we are very profitable with our convincing - kind of strategy of the revenue and portfolio right now to continue grow in 20 plus.
Amit Singh: Great. And then just one quick question Anthony, sorry to see you resign, but talking about your non-compete, how long is that, what is the duration of the non-compete that you have?
Anthony Conte: It will be 12 months from the time that I actually leave, will be the actual non-compete period.
Amit Singh: Okay, great.
Anthony Conte: I have no - I have no intentions of going to a competitor or competing with EPAM in anyway, I actually intend to remain a shareholder of EPAM. So most of the reason I'm leaving is more for personal business interests outside of EPAM.
Amit Singh: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Hi. Thanks. So the question I have is with regards to - is the standard 16% to 18% non-GAAP EBIT margin still achievable over the next couple of quarters and next 2 to 4 quarters let's just say, given what's going on with the utilization issue, and if not, what's a good range?
Anthony Conte: At this point, we are staying with that 16% to 18% range, but as you have seen this year and I would expect it to continue next several quarters, we're feeling pressure and it’s going to keep us to the lower end of that range.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Ashwin, right now our feeling is that we have got some utilization and we'll be improving and clearly utilization is probably the strongest impact on this number as well. So still thinking that that unless market change drastically for some one another reason we should be able to be in this corridor in the future.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Got it, got it. And in terms of 50, just to try to understand specifically what is going on because you do have a fairly robust increase in headcount that’s going on, what you're basically saying is you are hiring in certain locations. Your clients don't necessarily want current to be based in those locations is that what you're saying?
Arkadiy Dobkin: No, what we are saying and there are multiple reasons, again, it’s much more difficult analysis, but on the high-level what we're saying right now that we were planning to stuff client engagement, specific clients engagement, in specific locations and prepare for this and it was delayed couple times and then it was postponed and with our extra capacity in this locations. So at the same time we did committed to grow the other part of the clients in different locations and continue to hire simultaneously in different locations to satisfy our initial commitment and then we have already partial team there, so it wasn’t possible to change, that’s why we were around two extra capacity. So that's one of the biggest reasons, but it's again, it’s more complex situation and we have our operation in India which we mentioned didn’t play exactly as we expected all in the year, so which was additional point, and combination of this broad situation to where it is right now. But again, in our view all of this very fixable and manageable.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay. Basically you have enough demand at the people you have hired can get sort of utilized, used up and put on projects in the next couple of quarters, it seems like. The…
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, we are comfortable that where it was in locations where you have extra capacity which was prepared for specific clients, its qualified capacity, it’s just taken several quarters to reassign the few sources.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Can you comment little bit on the nature of what is causing the delay in these couple of locations, is it primarily macro demand?
Arkadiy Dobkin: That’s what we talked before, that’s what we’re sharing last quarter about financial services and that’s - and last quarter we said we don’t know exactly how it’s going to play out, but we know there is something happening. So it’s become much more clear right now. But even right now it could step on with the next couple of quarters the same clients compare to us. So it’s still pretty further.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Avishai Kantor with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Avishai Kantor: Hi, good morning. Thank you very much for taking my question. I think in the beginning of the year you were talking about factoring 3% pricing increases for this year for 2016, do you have any early indication what should we expect in early - in 2017 related for the for the next 12 months, are we still talk about 3%?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we will share with you this probably next quarter. So it’s too early for us right now to say it.
Avishai Kantor: Okay. And in the last conference call you were talking a little bit about pricing pressure, I mean, is this - are you still seeing the same environment?
Anthony Conte: At this point, you know, pricing - pricing is usually locked down in the first half of the year when you talk about renewals for existing accounts and then as new accounts come in its varied in this negotiation. So that hasn't changed dramatically from what we discussed last quarter, we're still feeling from a kind of an organic constant currency perspective we're still at just under 3% from a pricing perspective.
Avishai Kantor: Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Reid: Hi, guys. This is Mike Reid on for Joe Foresi. Thanks for taking our question. I just saw that the euro ticked up pretty good as a percentage of revenues this period. Could go on to a little detail on maybe what some of the causes of this were as percentage of revenues?
Anthony Conte: Euro it didn’t move dramatically this quarter. So I don’t want actually kind of talk to you about what you're looking at, the euro has been running pretty consistently as a percentage of revenue for the past several quarters. So what statistics are you looking at that show its spiking.
Mike Reid: Is it not on the stat sheet, it was up to 12% from about 9%?
Anthony Conte: It’s - yes, but it's been pretty consistently in that 10% or 11%, 12% for a number of quarters. That's why I don't see that as a significant increase.
Mike Reid: Okay…
Anthony Conte: There is nothing special to that moving - there is nothing special that’s moving the euro concentrations, just normal contracting, nothing dramatic has shifted.
Mike Reid: Okay, thanks. And then with the DSO down again, it was better, also is that something you see that level is - will still be sustainable?
Anthony Conte: At this point we're not comfortable saying that the Q3 DSO is sustainable. It took a big drop, a lot of this is the additional efforts we really been focusing over the past couple quarters. So I think that brought it down significantly, not willing to commit to these levels at this points, as a go forward we're going to take couple quarters and see how it trends and then we could talk about what's a consistent level.
Mike Reid: All right. Thanks, guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question.
James Friedman: Hi. If I could to Anthony, you are going kind of quick there, when you were discussing the as reported versus constant currency performance in Europe could I trouble you to repeat that?
Anthony Conte: As reported versus constant currency, yes, sorry. So the organic growth was 21%. The organic constant currency was 23%. That's what you were referring to?
James Friedman: I got that one, I appreciate you saying Anthony. I was asking specifically about Europe what as reported versus constant currency Europe number was?
Anthony Conte: As reported, for just European revenues? Or you talking euro revenues?
James Friedman: We're not…
Anthony Conte: I am not 100% sure, I am not 100% sure what the question is that you are asking.
James Friedman: In the language where you are saying North America growth that was 56.4% of revenue, up 38%, then you had Asia and then CIS is flat. What was in the script that you said about Europe?
Anthony Conte: I am sorry, I thought you were referring to the last question, my apologies. Europe constant currency was 25.6% versus 19.3% reported.
James Friedman: Yes, that’s what I was looking for. And then…
Anthony Conte: Sorry, apologies, I thought you referring to the last question.
James Friedman: Yes. And then with regard to the tax rate Anthony as we are going forward, I'm doing this from distant memory. But my recollections you had some special economic zones, that's too fancy word in some parts of CIS, what do you see is the tax rate from that region going forward anything to call out?
Anthony Conte: The only place we have a special tax benefit from an income tax perspective is in Belarus where we're enjoying a tax holiday through 2021, that's the only current special tax regime that we have and really we don't comment on regional tax structures, but we expect to stay in this 21% for the foreseeable future. 21 or low 20s is what I would expect until clearly in 2021 that could change, but that's a number of years out.
James Friedman: Okay. Last thing from me if I could, I realize you're not projecting the improvement in DSO and unbilled to continue, but could you just remind us, is there any seasonality - I seem to recall there was that occurs in the Q4 related to DSOs?
Anthony Conte: There has been in the past some Q4 seasonality where company is trying clear budgets and get payments closed out before the end of the year. That’s part of why I don't want to you know confirm any trends around the DSO until we have a few more consistent quarter. So there is a possibility of some additional you know benefits in Q4, that trend continues, but we need to see how things play out for the next couple quarters, so I am not really committing to any specific levels.
James Friedman: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Georgios Kertsos with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question.
Georgios Kertsos: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking the question guys. Couple from me, hopefully very quick ones. First of all is on the pricing environment. So if I am looking basically on non-GAAP operating it’s probably about 1 percentage points down year-on-year. Is that entirely due to utilization - capitalization or is it at least partly attributed also to some sort of adverse pricing movements? And then I have a follow up.
Anthony Conte: Utilization is the biggest impact that you are seeing on profit margins for this year. There are some other dynamics that play into that. We have been stepping up more over the past year in offshore locations, so that creates a little bit of a dynamic shift as well, because offshore obviously are going out at a lower price point than the on-site. So as you see our offshore concentration increase that impacts it. And then obviously the inclusion of India and China, which are at lower price points than our organic resources that create additional pressure. So I would say utilization as the top impact and then some shifting to lower price point locations adds additional impact there as well.
Georgios Kertsos: Got you. And a quick follow up on that, basically so I am looking at it from sort of a - is it the off shore penetration at present broadly at steady state level, i.e., should we expect the sort of year-on-year price deflationary or impact that you are seeing, you just highlighted to remain for the following quarters or basically accelerating the numbers?
Anthony Conte: Can you repeat that…
Arkadiy Dobkin: Can you repeat the question?
Georgios Kertsos: Yes. So basically if we're thinking about of off-shoring and if I have heard Anthony correctly, just actually seeing increasing slow penetration creates a price deflationary impact, so you h have constant volumes that pricing basically might becoming incremental lower for off-shore stuff. Now that top line headwind is likely to remain for as long as we increase off-shore penetration, i.e., it will grow way, when the off-shore penetration hit the state level. So effectively are we had already touched maybe state level or do we expect increasing off-shore in the following quarters as well?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. Let me take on this. First of all and this is related to situation to make sure we are on same pace. We [indiscernible] 3% production increase and if you try to analyze our organic numbers then we exactly as 3% so far during this nine months. So the second are increase in our store proportion clearly impacts the total pricing numbers is that what Anthony mentioned. But in our plans we go into - it’s not like we plan this like acquisition of the year since some increase in headcount we've had in china impacting this. So basically we slowed down with unsure growth in relative numbers. What we're planning to do, we definitely planning to increase our on-shore presence and country presence and we're going to grow into these areas in the next 12 months, so that's our plan. We still very committed to increase our presence in countries where we are getting revenue from and kind of client facing capabilities.
Georgios Kertsos: Okay…
Arkadiy Dobkin: So does it answer your question? Okay…
Georgios Kertsos: Yes, it does. And then quick follow up from me, can you just perhaps share a few high level thoughts about basically the UBS account, how you are seeing basically demand shaping up on that from? Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think we share it everything we knew and very difficult right now to make projections in this area. So we'll rather - we'll see what would be happening on the market, but clearly account slowed down, you can see from top line performance. But it is again, might go back, might grow back, might stay flat at this point, we don’t know.
Georgios Kertsos: Okay. Clear, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Christensen with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Christensen: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I think last week Thomson Reuters made a previously interesting announcement accelerating its restructuring, reducing headcount quite a bit, but they also said they are going to pick up the pace of their transformational efforts, which sounds like it's a positive for EPAM. Can you just give us any sense if there is any changes in the relationship there or perhaps the opportunities that you see with this large client of yours?
Arkadiy Dobkin: The problem was listed as one of the five preferred vendors, so is also you who kind of watching us for a long time [indiscernible] at some point it was logistic on cost and then it was down, today the account is one of the top three basically, much bigger than it was when it was the largest one. So - but again, similarly like with UBS, the account is extremely difficult to predict the future, that’s why we really focusing on right balance of account and diversification across industries as well.
Peter Christensen: Okay. And then you know, as it relates to the new executive appointment that you announced today, Larry Solomon, it did seem like you are hiring somebody that has extensive North American experience, does that tell us anything about your strategy of perhaps building up delivery here in the US or North America or just increasing your onshore ratio going forward?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think you need to understand Larry's experience significant time is his previous employer and he was responsible for the duration of globally challenged with current four locations and the gross across several hundred thousand people globally. His last three years was focus in North America, which is clearly beneficial for us, but Larry very well understands the global market as well.
Peter Christensen: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arvind Ramnani with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Washburn,: Hi, guys. This is Jason Washburn, for Arvind. I guess, we want to touch a little bit on kind of Anthony leaving and we saw its certainly surprise and we just wondered if there be a transition time for when you hiring new CFO and basically is the deadline extendable with no CFO is tired by then?
Anthony Conte: Well, the transition time frame him is about nine months. I mean, is committed through Q3 of 2017. We are going to begin the search immediately and quite frankly we're very optimistic that we can find somebody within that timeframe, and still have an adequate transition to ensure there is a smooth transition. So that's - you haven't really discussed extending beyond Q3 of 2017 at this point because we thought that that was nine months is more than sufficient…
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think if we will see any difficulties to fulfill this, but addition [indiscernible] so we can share right now.
Jason Washburn,: Okay. Thanks, guys. That’s it from me.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
David Grossman: Thank you. And sorry if this is been asked. I jumped on a few minutes late, we can take this offline. But I am just wondering is there a way to look at the mechanics to get to 20% growth going forward and by mechanics I mean, , is there a way to look at, for example, how the top 20 maybe growing vis-à-vis how the balance of the portfolio may be growing, because it sounds like we're going to have more diversified mix going forward than we've had historically and I'm just curious if you have some thoughts on how that may play out between those two pockets?
Anthony Conte: I think as you can see even historically, the vast majority of our growth is coming from outside of the top 20, where we are seeing growth in excess of a 40% year-over-year and the top 20 clearly as they become much larger clients you see the growth rates being more in line with that 20% and in some cases little bit lower than side of the account. So I think we still feel that the majority of our growth is going to be coming from deeper penetration into those existing accounts, many of which are currently outside the top 20. And as we continue to expand that's where we get confidence in our over 20% growth looking at the availability of the penetration in those particular accounts.
David Grossman: And then sorry, what was the growth by the top - outside the top 20 this quarter versus what it has been?
Anthony Conte: For this quarter the growth outside the top 20 was actually 43% and historically it’s been - this year we were at 45%, last quarter we had a 50% growth. It's always been in the high 20s, 30s and it's been trending up over 40 for at least the past year.
David Grossman: Okay. And then just looking - going back to the utilization challenge that you're facing right now, and I think I understand the dynamics when you are running a global model here. So what are the mechanics of how you get back to a normalized level? When you think about rebalancing the workforce to achieve higher utilization, is there an opportunity to keep people in the same locations and redeploy them another work or is it a lot more complicated than that as you try to work through this particular share?
Arkadiy Dobkin: The reality is all this more complicated [indiscernible] and that’s kind of what it is. But we do believe locations where you have more capacities then we need like during the last quarters, it’s a very good quality of the people and we will be able to bring new clients there. So we clearly on the press to deploy these people during the next several quarters.
David Grossman: So should we think of reason of going forward at least the next couple of quarters that we would expect headcount growth to moderate over the next couple of quarters as you absorb the capacity is that hard to do based on the geographic mix?
Arkadiy Dobkin: We do believe that - and that we don’t know if it’s one quarter or two, three quarters exactly, but we do believe that with the next several quarters we will bring in there blended utilization to the normal across it.
David Grossman: Right. So but just in terms of what we should expect to see on a reported basis going forward over the next couple of quarters, should we expect headcount to overall just to moderate to reflect the…
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, the headcount clearly that means that headcount will slow down versus current.
David Grossman: Right, okay. And then as I looked at - a saw the attrition rate ticked up a little bit and it has been ticking up over the last three quarters, I think you are running in the 7% to 8% range last year, and you are now, you are now at 10.5%. So is that dynamic reflecting what we're seeing in the slowing demand in some of these larger customers or is there a different dynamic that’s driving that?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think volunteer this mix was probably exactly at the level as it’s during the last couple of quarters, 1% or 2% volatility, it’s probably specific through the range we share was build up and become unnecessary. So but it’s very small.
Anthony Conte: Just David, come back, I mean, when we were down at the 7% to 8% and we were saying at that point we didn’t think that was a sustainable level, that was unusually low, we saw attrition drop quite a bit over the past couple of years. So we expected it to tick up a little bit as we move forward.
David Grossman: Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then just, Anthony, is there any way the current spot rates you can give us a sense of what that FX impact would look like in the fourth quarter, assuming the current spot rates just held steady?
Anthony Conte: I haven’t really done a current spot rate, what we actually do when we're doing our forecasting is we actually get revenue - sorry, currency forecast from a couple different banks and we use kind of blended forecasts as opposed to just kind of this path forward and we're still thinking you in Q4 that the headwinds - year-over-year headwinds are to be about 2%, 1% to 2% and that’s we're building kind of into our models for right now, based on forecast, not just spot.
David Grossman: Got it. All right, guys. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [indiscernible] Thanks for answering my question. Apologies if this is been hit a few times already, but can you please clarify what's going on with utilization rate and what kind of challenges you guys are facing in utilization? Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don’t know what we can add, again, we can just repeat ourselves. And then we have some commitments from clients to grow in specific locations, we prepared for this, then this was slowed down and then it was actually postponed for some unclear time period. So basically we have got extra capacity in very specific locations which were protected from assign into our accounts because of our commitment. At the same time, we continue to carry on other locations because we need to continue to grow and also when postponed was happened we try to compensate for this region and others locations as well continue to grow where we could. So because of the assignment of resources is not immediate. Let's bring some disconnect number one, number two, our expectation with India was exactly in line and we've got lower utilizations that we expected initially and again this is integration new for those locations, we are learning a lot of new and we are absolutely committed to grow in this area, but we have some slowdowns there too. Between these two factors, actually they are all disconnecting on utilization. But in our view it’s very much fixable and that’s what would our focus during the next couple of quarters.
Unidentified Analyst: Sounds great. Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with VTB Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hello and thank you taking my questions. Could you comment probably a little bit on the financial services [indiscernible] the UBS, do you see any bright spots this year and stabilization of this situation maybe not over the next couple of quarters, but in the longer term and do you see opportunities for you to grow here. And my second question is on your strategy, you have a pretty big cash pile on one hand on the other hand you have some extra capacity in some locations, as you mentioned, how do you see strategically growing, are you going to make any new acquisitions and grow maybe in the vertical areas and things like this? Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we do believe there many opportunities in financial sector, everybody knows about utilization and means that clients will have to adapt for this two, so invest a lot in [indiscernible] areas, at the same time I don’t think we can quote in longer term right now and specifically about our expectations, in 2017 we will be talking next time. So in regards to M&A, nothing changed here too, we definitely slow down during the 2016, but it’s not because lack of opportunities, it’s just due diligence just didn’t happen and we still considering different options how to bring expertise to growth. So we probably not going through all this specific new verticals, I think we have been balanced right now and it might happen that we will increase some focus on emerging areas, we have good place to - but I don’t think we are going to expand dramatically from areas where there are…
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Dobkin for any closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: As usual, thank you, everybody for joining. I think we addressed questions and in summary we have challenging quarter based on utilization, but we are pretty confident in our ability to continue growing and I hope to update you on this during the next call. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the EPAM Systems Q2 2016 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder all participants are in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lilya Chernova of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Lilya Chernova: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Right now you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's second quarter 2016 results. If you have not, the copy is available in the Investors section on our website at epam.com. The speakers for today’s call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Anthony Conte, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today’s call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company’s earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Arkadiy?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Lilya, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We had a strong quarter joining in a solid first half of 2016 with Q2 revenue of $283.8 million. This represents 30.3% year-over-year growth and 33.9% constant currency growth. Important to note, that our organic growth for Q2 was 24%, and in constant currency 27%. Our quarterly performance is above guidance is driven by continuous growth in our existing strategic accounts spanning across all verticals and geographies, aiding to growth on ways we have seen a good pipeline of new orders being added in each of our key geographies. Anthony will provide a more detailed update on our financial performance, but for now I would want to spend a few minutes on how we see demands and pricing going into the latter half of the year. Let's start with the most talked, about challenge in the market, the issue related to the U.K. decision to exit European Union and its impact on overall economic environment. First of all, I don't think it would be a surprise to anybody that at this point we do anticipate some downstream effect both on overall pricing and demand elasticity with several key accounts in the BFSI vertical. In the case of UBS, our largest account overall and by far the largest in our financial vertical. We have seen already indications of demand compression started in Q3 and expect those to continue in the last quarter of the year. At the same time, across the broader BFSI European business. While we have some indications to be conservative for the immediate demand, we also have new business opportunities across every major account. Additionally we’re seeing the general volatility affect sectors beyond financial services as even some consumer oriented companies in Europe are experiencing reduced visibility in their demand which could cause some delays in the decision process and increased scrutiny of discretionary budgets. So in result because of the current level of visibility it becomes more obvious that in some pockets of our targeted markets our clients business environment is becoming less stable and less predictable than we experienced before and it's rather difficult at this point to quantify the nature or the exact impact on demand and by extension on revenue numbers for the second part of the year. Practically, we anticipate the general environment might cause some delays in our effort of pricing adjustment, projects start and in some already contracted ramp-ups across specific lines in near future. On another side in North America, we anticipate strong growth in all verticals unless some uncertainty related to the election cycle with slow change in the business programs. In Europe, we also see an increased demand across a number of verticals. So for example in Life Science & Healthcare, to increase global revenue by 78% year-over-year and in our Media & Entertainment vertical return in a 47% year-over-year growth. We are also seeing significant growth in our emerging verticals with steel and energy clients. And as always we continue to focus on our traditionally strong are by expanding our foundation in software and high-tech vertical. So taken all those different drivers into the account, and as you look at our current book of business for the second half of 2016, we are optimistic that is our continuous help to transfer our clients’ organizations into digital connected businesses and with demand for such services and with our unique combination for business acumen, digital insight and engineering delivery excellence, we should be able to navigate well over the current period of uncertainty and still achieve our annual growth target which we said at the beginning of the year with year-over-year revenue increase of at least 26%. Now to what hasn’t changed at all in our view. We want to underscore that even with the overall volatility in the business environment, we are continually investing in our talent productivity platforms, IT development, deliver locations and service lines. This investments we believe are critical to ensure that we are well-positioned to deliver on the commitment we've made to our employees and our customers, and these are also the strategic differentiators which despite the current business environment will well position us to take advantage of the opportunities that will certainly reveal themselves over the course of the next few quarters. You also will recall from previous calls that we have taken a number of initiatives towards built-out and increase the visibility of our key go-to-market offerings. I am pleased to say that you were once again permanently featured in 38 industry analyst reports to Q1 and Q2 including coverage from Gartner, Forrester and other key leadership differentiators in areas of digital platform commerce cloud, agile, social, testing services, IT digital labs and innovation as a service and analytics and security. In closing I want to mention that this quarter is an important milestone for our company, as our trailing 12-month revenue has crossed $1 billion mark. So overall, we are confident that in long-term we will be able to demonstrate continuous revenue growth in excess of 20%. With this, turning over to Anthony.
Anthony Conte: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. As you heard in Ark’s comments, we’ve turned in another strong performance in the second quarter. Looking our results from a high level, here are a few key highlights. First, this is our 22nd consecutive quarter of over 20% organic growth, which demonstrates our effectiveness at delivering against our strategic plan, executing our diversification strategy and helping our clients continue to successfully navigate their challenges in the marketplace. Revenue closed at $283.8 million, 30.3% over second quarter of last year, and constant currency growth of 33.9% and 7.3% over Q1 2016. Geographically, North America remains our largest region, representing 56.7% of our Q2 revenues, up 45.8% year-over-year. Europe was up 17.4% year-over-year representing 36.1% of Q2 revenue. In constant currency terms EU would have been up 21.4% year-over-year reflecting the impact of both the euro and sterling volatility over the past year. APAC which only represents 2% of our revenue is slightly down and CIS is flat year-over-year. Further reinforcing our strong diversification story, which is one of the key underpinnings to our consistent growth, Q2 again demonstrated this broad-based growth story. As you heard from Ark, all of our verticals continue to grow and our client concentrations continued to improve, which emphasizes the growth we're experiencing from quite outside of our top 20. The addition of Navigation Arts and AGS, both contributed clients that mainly fell outside of the top 20; plus our concentrated sale efforts in winning new logos helped drive 45% year-over-year growth on all accounts outside of the top 20. Turning to profitability. GAAP income from operations increased 35.9% year-over-year to represent 11.3% of revenue in the quarter. Our non-GAAP income from operations for the quarter after non-GAAP adjustments increased 29.1% over prior year to $47.6 million, representing 16.8% of revenue. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 21%. For the quarter, we generated $0.46 of GAAP EPS, $0.71 of non-GAAP EPS, which includes the tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments that is based on 53.3 million diluted shares outstanding. As Ark mentioned, while we continue to invest in expanding key capabilities, the market volatility is impacting our ability to balance our resources against projected book and deploy demand. This lag is visible in the 2.6% drop in our overall utilization numbers for this quarter ending at 74%. To address the shifting demand and to rebalance our investments, we continued to improve our operations related to workforce planning utilization and believe the utilization impacts are short term. As you know historically, Q3 utilization drops to the heavy summer vacations, so Q3 will be another quarter relatively of low utilization with improvements coming in Q4. We finished this quarter with 18,206 IT professionals, representing a 6.2% increase from Q1 2016 and 27% over prior year excluding acquisitions. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash from operations for Q2 was $38.5 million, significantly above Q2 of 2015, which was $2.2 million. The increase in Q2 cash flows can be attributed to our decrease in our total AR and unbilled DSO and less expenditures in the quarter. This quarter are AR DSO is 57 days and our unbilled DSO is 31 days, for a total of 88 days. Compared to Q1 2016 AR DSO of 54 days and unbilled DSO of 40 days for a total of 94 days. Ark already discussed UBS at a high level but I’d like to specifically address DSO issue which you all have questions about in Q1. UBS DSO has improved dramatically. It's down to 85 days in total from 114 days in Q1. So based on the processes we’ve implemented last quarter to improve total DSO, we have made substantial progress. The AR DSO are still bit high but this is mainly due to the efforts to reduce the unbilled DSO which resulted increase invoicing that remains uncollected. We have a good process in place and we anticipate continued improvement. Turning now to guidance. We are reaffirming our year-over-year guidance of 26% revenue growth. Given the various macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, our normal visibility has been impaired and we could experience unexpected volatility over the next several quarters. We remain very confident about the continued long-term growth outlook for the business and overall markets. We still anticipate currency headwinds of approximately 3% resulting in constant currency growth of 29%. You may wonder why this has not increased in the recent fall in the British pound. While the pound has fallen compared to our expectations earlier in the year, we have seen improvements in the Russian rubel and Canadian dollar that have offset, keeping full year currency headwinds approximately in the same range. The four year GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $2.5 with an effective tax rate of approximately 21%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $2.97 which includes the tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments and the full-year weighted average share count is expected to be approximately 53.4 million diluted shares outstanding. And now for the third quarter. Revenue is expected to be at least $295 million, 25% above third quarter of last year, and includes about 3% currency headwinds resulting in constant currency growth of 28%. GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $0.52. Non-GAAP EPS will be at least $0.73, which includes the tax effects on non-GAAP adjustments and is based on a weighted average share count of 53.6 million fully diluted shares outstanding. With that, I’ll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. We will pause for a moment as callers join the queue. The first question today is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citibank. Please go ahead.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Good morning, Ark. Good morning, Anthony. Well, good quarter first of all, and thank you for the color with regards to what’s going on in the environment. I had a clarification to start. So when you say that you expect some projected start delays some pricing pressure in some parts [ph], is that explicitly incorporated in your outlook? So, for example, have you assumed the UBS, let's call it, $30 million quarterly instead of what they did this time, it's at $36 million, I just want to make sure that it is explicitly there in your guidance with offsets on the other side?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Hi, Ashwin. I think it’s incorporate in quarter in terms of our current visibilities. So that's what we’re seeing right now. So that's why we clearly communicate that environment is softer than we used to and that predictability a little bit less than before. So what we’re seeing right now that’s definitely incorporated. Right?
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Right. And then should these things pan out in terms of revenue weakness, pricing weakness, is there anything you can do on the cost side in the short-term to have some sort of an offset? I know you’re not spending less on strategic initiatives and I would personally argue neither should you, but is there anything else you can do maybe on the G&A side, or anything like that that helps?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we definitely considering different options there and Anthony also pointed it out on utilization which is probably not optimal right now and we definitely will be focusing on this part. At the same time we - at this point, we will continue to invest in the areas which we plan to invest and not going to cut costs there. Again utilization and staffing probably one of the area and because of all what was happened during last couple months, so we have, as mentioned several point higher than we anticipated. So but clearly we're looking at this.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay. And last quick clarification on DSOs. It's a good trend that that’s begun to get it back down to where it should be, but what is your long-term target?
Anthony Conte: We want to keep bringing it down but I think overall general targets is to get the overall DSO to kind of back to the mid-to-low 80s combined where I'd like to see it, and then the AR DSO to be somewhere in the mid 50s is probably what we are going to see there.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jason Kupferberg: Thanks. Good morning guys. So just to maybe build on some of those comments that you just made, mean, should we think about this as just kind of taking away some upside potential to the year? I mean, I know that you still have at least label on your revenue outlook, but given some of the cross currents out there, are we just thinking about more like this is an inline kind of year as opposed to having much in the way of upside given some of the challenges in Europe?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we can just repeat what we said already. So at the beginning of the year in [indiscernible] giving guidance we were giving guidance with what we saw and it was much more known. Right now to the end of the year, in general less - supposed to be a less unknown but volatility increased. So what we’re doing right now, again we share it with you exactly would we say. So we're also sharing with you that like you were asking practically each quarter how we are seeing the market, how we compare this is what is hidden from other companies, and the usual answer was that we don’t see the market changes. This time our message is different. We've seen some concerns. We’ve seen like companies were reacting on Brexit or maybe they were reacting after Brexit or sounds little before. So right now we, again sharing exactly what we see.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. I mean, I guess if you we were to…
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, go ahead.
Jason Kupferberg: Sorry. I was just going to say, so if we think about visibility in percentage terms, I mean, what would your visibility typically be at this point in the year on the full year outlook and what is that visibility now? I'm just trying to capture that.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Visibility to the final annual guidance, which we provided, very similar to our previous years. But again the market in our view is soft and that’s why we kind of openly sharing this. But visibility like in percentage, how we see like pipeline, it’s at this point similar to what we saw during the previous years.
Anthony Conte: I think the key addition is what we’re trying to say is that there is a lot more clouding that surround that visibility, so while we - the guidance we gave is based on what we see right now, there is a lot of changing events over the next six months and the economy. Things change almost on a daily basis, so we can't predict what that volatility is going to be. Based on what we see today, that's what our guidance is based upon and our visibility is comparable to prior years.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And I'm pretty sure you realize that our kind of position is reflection from what we see in the declines, and some of the clients which were much more confident before, right now not giving likely answers. So which means that they’re struggling to understand what’s going to happen. Again I'm pretty sure I'm not saying anything new to you.
Jason Kupferberg: Right, okay. I mean, that's helpful. Just one more. Are you changing your second half hiring plans at all just given your desire to bring the utilization rate back up and given some of this uncertainty in the demand environment?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, we definitely adjusting this but it’s also nothing new here. We are doing this practically real-time during the last years. Like if you think about it like in the past, like some events happening, we do in the adjustments of our hiring plans between different locations and number of people, and clearly we are doing this right now. We mentioned our utilization is higher than we expected
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: You’re welcome. Over to next question.
Operator: It’s from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Darrin Peller: Thanks guys. I just want to start off with helping segment the growth rates by your client base. I’m trying to get a little sense as to whether you're seeing a little less certainty from certain types of clients versus others. I mean, last quarter you had a high-teens growth rate from your top clients and 30%-plus growth from your, let's call it, tail 80% of your client base. Is that trend similar now? I mean, are you seeing any specific large clients maybe the top five or so that are pulling back in because of saying we're going to hang tight and give you a decision later. Can you just give us a sense as to the mix in terms of growth profile?
Anthony Conte: Yes, I mean, I think I had mentioned it in my commentary as well that the accounts outside of our top 20 are growing at a much faster rate than those within our top 20. I don't know that that's a reflection that the top 20 are not growing. They are still - if you look my top 20 are still growing at high-teens rate and with the lower 18%. It's just that those outside the top 20 are growing at about 45% rate. So it's more a reflection of the diversification of our client base. Our top 20, some of them are getting to be quite sizable, so some low big numbers they start to slow down a little bit in the growth rate. We're still very confident. We're still getting strong growth from a lot of those in our top 20. We do have some that are flattening out. We talk about Barclays every so often being a little bit flat over the past several years, so that obviously impacts overall top growth rates. And then we have a couple of other accounts within our top 20. Every year we have it. We have some that flat now drop-outs, change, so that's just the normal dynamic, nothing unusual in it this year.
Darrin Peller: Is there anything, let's call the top five or 10 that’s new that this quarter given Brexit or any other uncertainties in the macro have decided to say that used to be driving growth for you guys that are now deciding not to, and that’s contributing to your decision on guidance for the second half?
Anthony Conte: Well, I think clearly UBS has made their own statements around concerns around Brexit, and we know that European banks in general are struggling, so UBS growth rate, I’m sure you've seen it, this quarter was about 14% year-over-year which is below the growth rate we've seen historically in that account. And as far as others, nothing specific to call out. Nobody else that specifically pulling things down. I think there is just a general sense across the client base of unease and uncertainty with where the markets are going.
Darrin Peller: And then lastly, is there anything in the second half that sort of anniversaring organic or inorganic from some of the acquisitions you have made, or is there any impact there that you're growing over deals that might be contributing as well, just because obviously the second half implied growth rates in more like mid-20s versus mid-30s, you run again in the first half of the year on a constant currency basis, so just trying to understand that.
Anthony Conte: You're asking about the growth rate in the second half versus the first half?
Darrin Peller: What was organic growth during the quarter, if you can help us with that? And then what in the second half - is there anything that you bought that's anniversaring that's contributing to this?
Anthony Conte: Organic growth was 24%, 27-ish in constant currency.
Darrin Peller: Okay.
Anthony Conte: So that’s it. As far as in the second half, yes, I mean last year Navigation Arts was the second half acquisition. AGS was a second half acquisition. So we pick those up. One was in Q3. One was in Q4.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think AGS was practically on the board versus New Year.
Anthony Conte: It was [indiscernible].
Darrin Peller: What was that?
Anthony Conte: Does that answer your question, Darrin? I’m not sure if I’m getting…
Darrin Peller: Yes, so there is a couple of - so there is certainly some of the growth profiles embedded and you guys you’re going to grow over as well.
Anthony Conte: Yes.
Darrin Peller: Okay. Alright guys, thank you very much.
Anthony Conte: Sure. No problem.
Operator: The next question is from Anil Doradla of William Blair. Please go ahead.
Anil Doradla: Hey guys, couple of questions. So you talked about Europe. You talked about some of the banking guys. When I dig into perhaps UBS, over the last four to six months, there have been some changes. You've had a Chief Information Officer coming onboard in February-March. I think they got a new CIO literally within the last month. So from that account point of view, how much would you attribute it to structural changes organizational changes, and first of all, did it impact you guys on that front?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Well, it is a question which we don’t have answer truthfully to what the organizational changes and what’s the economy, and what’s the Brexit. I don’t think I can comment on this. I don’t know how to put priority on any of these components.
Anil Doradla: Okay. And when you look at some of the functions, you talked about some softness from that region, in the BFSI area, were there some particular functions where you were seeing perhaps a little bit more pull back, more softness versus some other, whether it's wealth management, whether it is application development? Can you give us some color on whether you could break it down by functions, or was it kind of across the board?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It was maybe a little bit in specific regions in APAC for us, but for the future even like for Q3 or Q4, we are very much on the impression that if client is considering some cuts, they are still struggling internally in what areas is going to be or slightly across multiple areas. So I think the exception of an APAC right now, I don’t think we can name anything.
Anil Doradla: Okay, and from a share point of view, you’re not worried about your market share, right? There is no concern about you losing share to competitors. This is purely a macro-driven issue that's going on. Is that fair to say?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Based on what we know, it's correct.
Anil Doradla: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from David Grossman of Stifel Financial. Please go ahead.
David Grossman: Thank you. So Arkadiy, historically when you’ve seen this deceleration among some of your larger clients for whatever reason, that has been absorbed by other clients that have kind of stepped in and not only absorbed that but also drove for us. And it sounds like to the extent that that's happening with UBS and maybe others in the back half of the year that that may be happening again, so you reiterated your 20% organic growth target, so should we take from that that the backlog of opportunity in this rest of the base should be sufficient for you to continue to grow at 20%-plus organically assuming the environment doesn't fall out of bed from where we’re right now?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we would like again repeat ourselves. So yes, in the past, it was kind of similar situation but each time it’s a little bit different. I think right now at this specific point maybe in two weeks or four weeks from now, we will be in different position. At this specific point, the level of unpredictability is higher than we used to, at least in this segment which we highlighted. Okay? So we still think that our initial target could be reached, and again we’ll update later. Like in the past, like yes, there are similar situation but each of them were a little bit different. Sometimes we were getting like pretty specific notification like with a specific plans. Right now everything is little bit farther, at least again in this specific segment of the market which we can talk about.
David Grossman: Okay. And just to make sure I understood you correctly. Your specific concern is the financials in Europe, that's where the specific concern is right now?
Arkadiy Dobkin: This is number one. Number two, that it might be impacting some other sectors in the region as well.
David Grossman: Right. Okay. And then I'm wondering if you just clarify your commentary about pricing. I’m just - perhaps you could help us better understand why you’re seeing incremental pressure on pricing now?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Because of all of these reasons and there is more difficult negotiation for potential increases, and we explained before how the pricing - what components contribute to pricing increases from review and the seasonality of the position, from annual increases, which is not necessarily matching the calendar year, right. So all these components, and we just anticipate that it probably would be more difficult than before.
David Grossman: Okay. So just to be clear…
Arkadiy Dobkin: Or even with new contracts it could be more difficult as well.
David Grossman: I see. Okay. Very good. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question is from Avishai Kantor of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Avishai Kantor: Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you very much for taking my question. Can you describe the nature of the interactions that you’re having with those large European financial services clients which you mentioned, how - compared to your conversations with clients in other verticals, are those different conversations?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, it’s a different conversation with - because there is discussions about the future and this discussion changed from what it was like one quarter or two quarters ago. So there is change in plans. The problem with this is the plan is not defined and I think the specific line is still struggling with their decisions. And that’s why we had to translate the same level of unpredictability which we have. But again at the same time, we do think that we would be able to achieve our guidance which we provided at the beginning of the year.
Avishai Kantor: Okay. And then, I know it’s too early but given increased costs associated with Brexit for some of those clients, longer term do you see any increased willingness to engage in additional projects?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Listen, it’s much more - again it’s much more complicated from different angles. Too many variables and unknown, like from one point of view, definitely they are trying to figure it out how it would influence them. On another side, there is also a lot of movements as this declines to optimize the vendors infrastructure. So there is a chance that it would be increase, so our share would increase as well taking in account of type of work we are doing. So what’s going to be there like two quarters from now? I don’t think anybody knows, but it was previous question we would do things that we wouldn’t share of the budget. There like proportionally we don’t believe so. I think our share probably is still going to be increased.
Avishai Kantor: Thank you so much for the detailed answer.
Operator: The next question is from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Ben [ph] in for Steve this morning. Anthony, could you comment on your long-term expectations for margins and revenue for engineer? Are we kind of at a new normal here? Do you expect improvement going forward? Thanks.
Anthony Conte: No, our operating guidance holds. We’ve always said we’ll be between 16% to 18% in the adjusted operating margin. That guidance has not changed, and as you can see we’re somewhere right in the middle or almost at the middle of that guidance range and we don’t provide guidance on a revenue per engineer.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from James Friedman of Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.
James Friedman: Hi. Congratulations on the improvement in cash flow and the unbilled. Anthony, what should we anticipate the trajectory on those metrics going forward?
Anthony Conte: As I said earlier, DSOs longer term, we’re focusing on getting them down even more. So we’re down to about 88 total pulled up six days out this quarter. Most of those six days were from the two big accounts we talked about last period, UBS being one and one other large client. So we fixed those issues and a few other steps to improve DSO brought down to 88. We want to continue to push that down to kind of mid-to-low 80s overall is the target. That will probably take a few - at least a few more quarters to cycle through, so that’s the overall guidance there.
James Friedman: Okay. And can you remind us is there seasonality in that metric. Should we be thinking about it that way?
Anthony Conte: Seasonality in DSO metric?
James Friedman: Yes.
Anthony Conte: Look, maybe a little bit towards the end of the year and the beginning of the year around holiday times and things of that nature, people tend to try and clean out budgets at the end of the year, so we always see a little bit of a pop at the end of the year as people make and accelerate payments. And then there is typically a slowdown at the beginning of the year as people are starting up the New Year, budgets are being set. But I don’t think it’s dramatic.
James Friedman: Got it. All right, thank you for the color.
Anthony Conte: Yes.
Operator: The next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citibank. Please go ahead.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Hi, I just wanted to hop back in the queue. Ark, your answer to a previous question I think it's from David on pricing. You implied - because when you first said pricing I thought you were talking about price decreases being contemplated, but your answer implied more or less a lack of pricing increase. So I just want to clarify, are both those things on the table basically?
Anthony Conte: No, we weren’t talking about pricing decreases. I mean we’re still - year-to-date we’re still staying right around just under 3% as far as pricing increases. What Ark was alluding to was that we just start expecting to see any additional expansion of pricing. We expect to continue to see pressure on getting price increases into the future, not necessarily decreases. That wasn’t really part of the message.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay.
Arkadiy Dobkin: We were talking about again more difficult environment in our regular incremental increases like which happened during the year as well.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Yes, understood. I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you very much.
Anthony Conte: Yes.
Operator: The next question is from Arvind Ramnani of Pacific Crest. Please go ahead. Mr. Ramnani your line is open.
Arvind Ramnani: Hi. Can you hear me?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes.
Arvind Ramnani: Great. Impressive performance at your non-top 20 accounts. And if you can provide some color, how did this compare to growth of non-top-20 accounts compared to last year, is this growth accelerating?
Anthony Conte: It’s comparable. I mean, last year the account size of the top 20 were growing in excess of 40%. We’re seeing the same this year. So I think the consistent message that we talk about is the diversification of our client base and the amount of growth that we get across our client base both within our top 20 and more importantly outside the top 20 as we have new accounts growing and becoming those future top 20s is very important to us and that’s how we grow through all these years is that we see constant flow of new clients into our pipeline and accelerated growth outside the top 20 as these accounts ramp up. So I think it’s a consistent message from past years.
Arvind Ramnani: Great, and are there any specific accounts or industries you can call out in this particular group?
Anthony Conte: It’s really across the board as far as industries. I mean, there is no accounts that I can mention, but it is pretty broad-based across our industry segments and I think you can see that when you look at the growth across the industries because they are all growing in excess of 20% as well with obviously I called - or Ark called out, three key segments which are growing a little bit faster than the others this time around being Life Sciences and Healthcare, Media & Entertainment is doing well and then within the emerging vertical, we have a number that are contributing as well. So right now we’re seeing a lot of growth from those but really seeing over 20% growth from everybody which is what we’re going to see.
Arvind Ramnani: Excellent. And then just a quick question on Dextrys. Are you going to provide some metrics in how large Dextrys is, and what kind of contribution will be for the second half of the year from this acquisition?
Anthony Conte: No. Dextrys is really a very immaterial acquisition. It was primarily focused on bringing in a few extra employees in China - I’m sorry, a few hundred extra employees in China in a new location up near Shanghai. It’s a lower cost location, provides us access to Shanghai market. The revenue was really not material, so there is nothing to disclose there. It’s not going to have any significant impact on our performance.
Arvind Ramnani: Excellent, and a good job on improving DSOs. Good luck for the remainder of the year.
Anthony Conte: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Joseph Foresi of Cantor. Please go ahead.
Joseph Foresi: Hi. Just to go back to the softness you’re seeing. Is this because clients are under stress, or is it more associated with just concerns over what Brexit is going to look like? And I’m wondering, are they delaying the start of new projects but still continuing present work and/or are they cutting present work?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it’s really a related like question. I think they have more difficult time because of Brexit in general and that’s why they are uncertain about future. So I don’t know what else to add to what we said already. So at this point, we’re seeing again a less certainly in some pockets of our market and some specific line, and that’s all we can share. I don’t know what to add.
Joseph Foresi: Okay. And then, I guess from a utilization standpoint, obviously it ticked down and then you’re talking about the seasonality in the summer. That utilization movement, where - are you taking people off of projects that are being cut and moving them onto new work, or is it just that you didn’t have that extra work in the quarter? I'm just trying to understand where they’re going and when we can expect sort of the rebound in that metric?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we do believe - again Q3 usually it’s a time of vacations and that’s why season play a role here. That’s what we experienced during the last year. It’s always bringing a couple of additional points to our range. So we do think that it would rebound in Q4.
Joseph Foresi: Okay. And then as you look into your full kind of client base and I know you’ve talked about areas of growth compensating for some of the areas where you are seeing some softness, and that’s why you are confident in the guidance. Maybe you can just walk us through those potential areas like North America, and why you feel like they are kind of hot pockets that won't be affected by what’s going on globally?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So that’s what we are seeing on the market. So again all our message is just a reflection of understanding of our specific portfolio of clients. And from this, we’re still optimistic that we would be able to achieve the guidance. And North America from this point of view is more stable than Europe and that’s all we can say. So if any changes will be happening, we will be communicating them as soon as possible.
Joseph Foresi: Okay. Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Georgios Kertsos of Berenberg. Please go ahead.
Georgios Kertsos: Yes, hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. As you can probably imagine, most of my questions have basically been answered. But I just like to follow-up on the pricing pressure point that seems to be one of the key points that you’re raising. I noticed a bit of a gross margin contraction year-on-year. So Q2 versus Q2 ‘16, ‘15, and I was just wondering whether this is due to this sort of wider pricing pressure that you’re referring to, or whether this is due to some contract specific issues, and what are your FY16 and beyond, if possible, gross margin expectations. Thank you.
Anthony Conte: Yes, the gross margin is really specifically tied to the utilization. So the drop in utilization is what creates - having more people on the bench is what creates that compression on the gross margin. So as we adjust utilization issue, the gross margin should take care of itself.
Georgios Kertsos: Okay. So just back to a follow-up just to confirm, so the bench, basically people that are not utilized, you book the cost for those people in cost of goods sold rather than SG&A? That’s what it seems to...
Anthony Conte: Correct. Anybody who has a label considered a production or billable employee is classified as cost of revenue and goes to that line.
Georgios Kertsos: Okay. So basically capturing all that point together is that you’re not really expecting any significant gross margin contraction for the full-year and beyond based on the visibility that you have now. Is that correct?
Anthony Conte: That is correct. We’re not expecting any compression, significant compression.
Georgios Kertsos: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Moshe Katri of Williams Trading. Please go ahead.
Moshe Katri: Hey thanks, let me add my congrats on the DSO improvements at UBS. Just going back to the discussion on pricing compression, are there any major contract renewals coming up which could include some of this pricing pressure that you’re talking about that we should be aware of? And then just in terms of how these contracts are structured with existing engagements, I guess, can the client come in and ask for pricing reset on an agreement that's actually that’s been signed a year ago or a few years ago? Thanks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: There is nothing specific about any renewals right now. On another side, Moshe, I’m pretty sure you know that any client can come and ask for any discount at any point depending on their situation on the market situation. So it always could be happening even with any existing contract. So that’s always on the table. The same like if market difference we can do opposite as well, but then its negotiation all-related circumstances.
Moshe Katri: Okay, that's fine. That makes sense. And then some color on some of the growth rates we have seen in Media and then on the Life Sciences, these are pretty strong numbers for the quarter. And then also in that respect, maybe we can also talk about some of the new strategic wins that you had during the quarter and year-to-date maybe in terms of verticals and the activity that you are seeing there? Thanks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think in general nothing special happening - didn’t happen or going to happen during this last and next quarters. I think we have good performance in two verticals. Healthcare also Life Science affected by some acquisitions happened with Alliance Global, but it’s also reflection of some organic growth in new clients in this sector as well. So it’s a combination of the strong specific focus. It’s all in line with what we communicated during the last quarter. So we think that each of our segment is pretty interesting and perspective for us including the financial services too. We’re still very optimistic about long-term future there. So it’s a lot of changes going to happen, a lot of potential work for us too especially with our focused areas of expertise and capabilities and build-out we should do it.
Moshe Katri: Okay. And then strategic wins. Is there a way to kind of quantify how many of these did you have during the quarter maybe year-to-date and then where do you see the most activity in terms of verticals?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Strategic in terms of?
Anthony Conte: Clients.
Arkadiy Dobkin: You’re asking about number of clients in specific areas or what exactly?
Moshe Katri: I'm asking how many strategic client wins did you have during the quarter, or where are we year-to-date and maybe there is a way to segment it by vertical?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, I guess, you mean new clients or what?
Moshe Katri: Yes.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay.
Anthony Conte: So I think the quantification is probably three or four new real strategic accounts beyond - Ark mentioned a few last quarter, there is probably a couple more that came in this quarter, but I don’t think there is only huge stories. A couple of new strategic accounts that we see real opportunity for growth. But Moshe, you know our story is always. We get into the clients. We do a few projects and then they grow from there. So it’s the same basic trend that we have experienced in the past, so two or three that we see real opportunity to grow and deep penetration.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So basically from the point of new logos which we acquired last quarter or we kind of increased sales right now it’s pretty much in line with our historical numbers.
Moshe Katri: All right guys.
Arkadiy Dobkin: But we don’t see any bad messages in this area.
Operator: This concludes the time allocated for questions on today’s call. I would now like to turn the conference back over Arkadiy Dobkin for closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And as usual, thank you very much for joining us today. So I would like just to confirm that despite of the softness which we see in those market, we’re pretty confident about long-term story and I think our message from this point of view very consistent for the last four years starting from our IPO days that we’re still thinking that 20%-plus organic growth is possible for us and going to happen, and that our operational margins will still be between 16%, 18% like it was like we said several years ago. So we’re still pretty confident in this long-term. Again, thank you very much and see you in three months or talk to you in three months. Bye.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating and have a pleasant day.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the EPAM Systems First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Ms. Lilya Chernova, Investor Relations for EPAM Systems. Thank you. You may begin.
Lilya Chernova: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter 2016 results. If you have not, the copy is available in the Investors section on our Web site at epam.com. The speakers on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Anthony Conte, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Arkadiy?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Lilya and thanks everyone for joining us today. We've had a strong quarter and a solid start for 2016 with Q1 revenue of $264 million. This represents 32% year-over-year growth and 34.5% constant currency growth and puts us well on our quest to achieving our financial performance goals for 2016. In addition, it's important to know that our organic growth for the quarter was 24% and 26% in constant currency. Our quarterly results are above guidance and we do believe are driven by our ability to address strong demand for new advanced technologies and digital services across all our key markets. During our call last quarter, and then during the Investor Day when many of you joined us in New York City, referred the main market drivers and our key challenges and the ways we are addressing or plan to addressing those. So today while Anthony will provide a detailed update on our financial performance, I would like just to summarize one more time the main trends in client demands and how we are shaping our services to take advantage of significant opportunities that we see in the market for the firms like EPAM. So let's start from markets, customer spend in new clients. First of all and very simply, we see continuous emphasis from existing and prospective customers on partners who can help them delivering differentiated business solutions, which allow better competing in their respective markets. It doesn't mean competing just with the traditional or historical competitors. But in many cases with new type of technology-driven players, sometimes very well established like Googles of the world and sometimes with completely unknown just yesterday startups. In many cases this need for differentiated product is driven by [life] [ph] digital transformation programs, but in many cases as well the demand might be coming from the downstream necessity to modernize core technology platforms in response to competitive disruption or sometimes regulatory or compliance mandates. In result, the broader set of services include traditional applications, but in addition digital touch point creation, digital business strategy, process and service design engagements, back-end re-factoring and a number of related as a service offerings and finally an aggregation of all of the above. Platform build-ups and their implementations, including heavy duty custom development and complex integration and overall orchestration efforts across many sophisticated and best-in-class components of those platforms. In addition, we also see customers beginning their efforts and initiatives involved in such key emerging trends like Internet of Things, virtual and augmented reality and Smart Software components and platforms. In most of those areas, our initial product and engineering heritage gives us an advantage over traditional solution providers, especially in organizations where there is a desire to eliminate or significantly reduce the reliance on legacy systems, or when heavy legacy modernization is required. All of this translates into the opportunity for us to serve significantly broader markets than we would have captured even a few years ago with a more diverse portfolio of services that are very tightly integrated into what we call hybrid type of engagements. Overall, we are benefiting from an upward trend on size of programs we are engaging. And while there is pricing pressure evident as a result of overall global lower inflationary environment, we are pleased to say that we are negating over those challenges well. We believe that for those of you who was able to join our Investor Day in March, all above trends were well illustrated by three clients' stories presented during the event. Think about it. Wolters Kluwer is a client, which was started to serve more than 10 years ago. That was our traditional outsourced product development client, for example. Today, the information and publishing business is in center of the digital transformation story and they feel a lot of competitive pressure. We really started to change ourselves three, four years ago to help them to address those new challenges. We've brought different EPAM capabilities together and added strong innovative thinking on top to help solving some very critical problems and as a result, differentiated EPAM significantly from majority of other vendors serving Wolters Kluwer today. Another client presenting was Liberty Global, the largest global company of the world. With this we work just a bit over three years. Working for them, we've been able to combine agency and engineering capabilities and deliver a number of innovative applications and as a result, also to differentiate ourselves strongly from competitors. Finally, Human Longevity, Inc., only about a year in relationship, and probably too early to claim any overall success yet. But still we put together a team of designers, like France and South Korea subject matter experts. VR and AR developers and in addition to strong software engineering capabilities and proved that we can make it all work together and delivering the first version of product in record time. So they are practically a legacy or EPAM traditional client. They're three years old and the one which practically just started with us. All are among our top 20 or 30 clients today and all driven by the same market pressure to engage with their own client faster, better and stronger and we are growing with them just because we demonstrated in very practical way those hybrid capabilities, capabilities in which we invested heavily during the last several years and in which we plan to continue investing in the future. That is probably why despite overall market pressure in financial services, there is still demand for our services in this vertical. We're also seeing significant acceleration in demands for digital services in traditional banks and also the rise in demand for the next generation payment models and related technologies, both from customer expectations, as well as the regulatory requirements point of view. In support of this trend, we've seen increased traction with the key new and existing customers in financial services market. Sometimes with a need to accelerate on volume for some engagement from zero to 100 engineers just in one quarter. We are sharing that to address specifically console in regards to financial services business, based on the kind of remarks we're getting from you. But beyond financial services, across our main geographies in Europe and North America, Q1 for us was marked by significant up tick in the number of new digital engagements, seven in total, with some of those being very promising to potentially large multi-year relationships, specifically around e-commerce and digital marketing platform. As for example, for Everson Everywhere in U.K. and for Amway across the Continents. In terms of our go-to-market positioning, we are pleased to see the increased visibility our growing capabilities are driving. Our recognition among market leading independent research agencies, including Forrester, Gartner, Zinnov and some others has increased significantly, positioning us as a new type of service provider. In Q1, we were covered in 11 industry analyst reports focusing on the range of areas, from business intelligence to SAP core technologies, to service design and customer experience and to B2B commerce services. We've also seen recognition of our unique value proposition for companies looking to take engineering into age of digital transformation. Just in April of 2016, EPAM was recognized by Forrester as a leader in the digital product and platform engineering wave. They cited us as being the company which exhibited the strongest grasp and execution of digital platform engineering services of all the vendors evaluated. And in this report were included all key service providers with traditionally strong software product engineering capabilities. All that is translating to increased pipeline of opportunities and we hope to see this new deals, as well as the larger sized deals to accelerate as we move into the year. At the same time, to keep the level of expectation and target, I would like to state that even with increased recognition and number of recent awards, we are still very much in the beginning of our journey. Our focus continues to be on building and deploying hybrid capabilities and integrated teams better and on making sure that our strong customer delivery track record continues to be our main driver of value. This brings us to another key area we tried to cover during Investor Day, balance, scale, hiring. From an end-market perspective, we continue to face a very competitive global environment as we position EPAM as an employer of choice in all EPAM key locations across the globe. While this challenge is part of the overall competitive talent environment, we believe that EPAM is well positioned to not only hire, but also to train and deploy multi-disciplinary teams. To this end, we continue our focused investment program in training events and professional development for our entire global employee base. Previously, and during the Investor Day, we have shared some examples of these investments in training and global collaboration platform we developed internally. Interesting to mention that just recently we hosted, utilizing such investments, our Global Information Technology Week event that engaged over half of the EPAM total employee breadth and featuring 400 strategic technology and people development sessions, shared across 23 countries and 75 cities. In regards to this quarter, I am happy to share that we are performing well across the board on talent acquisition targets, with total delivery personnel reaching 17,150 employees at the end of Q1. We continue to see strong hiring metrics in key for us European markets and this translates into better support for faster engagement ramp-ups and giving us the scale needed to bring larger near-shore engagements. With that, I will turn to Anthony to provide more details on our financial results and Q2 guidance.
Anthony Conte: Thank you, Ark and good morning everyone. We turned in a strong performance in the first quarter and our key highlight is still revenue growth. Revenue closed at $264.5 million, 32.2% over first quarter of last year and 1.6% over Q4 2015. As a reminder, Q1 is typically our slowest quarter from a sequential growth perspective due to CIS holidays in January, short month of February and the beginning of a new budget season for most customers, causing a slow ramp-up in Q1. Currency still remains a part of our story. We saw about $4.5 million of year-over-year headwinds, making our constant currency growth rate 34.5%. Organically, revenue grew year-over-year 24.2% and 26.5% in constant currency. Growth remains very well distributed across all verticals with all verticals turning in over 25% growth year-over-year. Geographically, North America grew 45% and 29% organically; Europe was up 19% and APAC up 14%. We are encouraged by the return of double-digit growth in CIS, which has struggled the past several years and currently represents only 3.4% of revenue. It has grown 15% over Q1 2015 and 36% in constant currency. Turning now to profitability, GAAP income from operations increased 32.9% year-over-year to represent 11.5% of revenue in the quarter. Our non-GAAP income from operations for the quarter, after all adjustments, increased 28.6% over prior year to $3 million, representing 16.3% of revenue. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 21%. And for the quarter, we generated $0.72 of non-GAAP EPS, $0.02 above the top end of our guidance and $0.45 of GAAP EPS, based on approximately 52.9 million diluted shares outstanding. I want to take some time to dive a bit deeper into our non-GAAP net income and EPS figures. As many of you know and have discussed with me in the past, the adjustments between GAAP and non-GAAP are not tax affected. Based on these discussions and the growth that we have seen in those adjustments over the past several years, we've elected to make a change in our reporting and begin reflecting the tax impact. For Q1 2016, the tax effect was $3.1 million on non-GAAP net income and $0.06 on non-GAAP diluted EPS, making Q1 2016 tax-affected non-GAAP net income $34.7 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.66. This compares to Q1 2015 tax effect of $4.6 million, resulting in non-GAAP net income of $26.5 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.52. The two main components of non-GAAP adjustments are first, stock compensation, which has increased over the past several years due to stock price appreciation, headcount growth, stock used in M&A, which is also tied to employment. The second main adjustment to our GAAP figures is amortization of intangibles and other related acquisition costs. We completed eight acquisitions over the past four years, which has caused the spike in this figure. If you would like to see the historical impact of the tax affected numbers, you can find the quarterly and annual details in our factsheet on the Web site. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet; cash from operations for Q1 was $10.9 million, 58% above Q1 2015 of $6.9 million and $1 million below Q4 2015. Overall, Q1 cash flows were strong. Uncollected revenue, the combination of AR and unbilled did continue a slight drag, but not significant and not anything we are concerned about. However, since there has been a consistent area of questions from investors and analysts, I'll dive a bit deeper into a few key components of the cash flow. Let's start with our DSO. As you know, we've experienced consistent growth over 20% since IPO. So as we become larger, we become a more significant expense to our customers, which makes us a larger part of their procurement and cash flow strategy, which equals longer payment terms. This quarter, our DSO is 58 and our unbilled DSO is 94, higher than in the past. We are aware of the impact and have already taken steps to address this by adding more a focus on our collections group and re-staffing some of the key financial personnel. A few other key points, I would like to further highlight around our billing cycle, which directly impact the DSO and how you compare those to our peers. You need to remember that the majority of our revenue are T&M, significantly higher than many of our peers, meaning that 85% roughly of the last month's revenue will be in unbilled at the end of any month. This is a short-term impact and usually resolves itself by the end of the year. Lastly, working capital continues to grow, ending 41% above Q1 2015 and 11% above Q4 2015. So while I understand there are some concerns in the marketplace around our balance sheet and DSO, our cash position, operating cash flows and working capital all continue to grow and strengthen. Turning now to our guidance. We are reiterating our full year 2016 guidance of year-over-year revenue growth of at least 26%, net of currency headwinds estimated at 3%, meaning constant currency growth of 29%. The full year GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $2.05, with an effective tax rate of approximately 21%. Under our old method, the full year non-GAAP diluted EPS was estimated to be at least $3.20, but once adjusted for the full year tax effect, which we expect to be $12.6 million, non-GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $2.97. The full year weighted average share count is expected to be approximately 53.6 million diluted shares outstanding. And now for the second quarter. Revenues for the second quarter will be at least $280 million, representing a growth rate of at least 28.6% over second quarter 2015 revenue. This includes 3% anticipated currency headwinds, meaning constant currency growth of at least 31%. Second quarter 2016 GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $0.46. Second quarter 2016 non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be at least $0.70 after adjusted for the tax effect and based on estimated second quarter 2016 weighted average of 53.2 million diluted shares. With that, I would like to turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.
Jason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask some question about the seven new digital engagements that you mentioned in the prepared remarks. It sounded like at least some number of those could become sizable. Wanted to get a sense of whether these engagements are with new or existing clients and could some of these end up creating a new top 10 client for you guys?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Those seven engagements we mentioned this is all new clients. So are they willing to translate to really large relationship, it's too early to say. But, as I mentioned, couple of them definitely have the potential. No, these engagements are not impacting our top 10.
Jason Kupferberg: Not yet, okay. Understood. And then, just on the pricing front, I know you'd mentioned that there is some pricing pressure, just given macro conditions around the world, but have you changed any of the pricing expectations that are baked into your full year guidance, because from what I recall, I think you've taken a little bit less pricing expectation for 2016 versus what your actual experience had been in the last couple of years?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. At this point, we are having the same assumptions as last time in projecting our numbers.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. And then just last for me, on the margin front, I think we're 16.3% on the non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter. Obviously, it's still within your range, but kind of the lower part of your range. Do you think this will be a trough level for the year? Were there any factors that impacted that metric a bit and do you expect it to pick up a little bit during the balance of 2016?
Anthony Conte: Yes. We always expect to see some up tick as we move through the year. You remember Q1 is our tightest quarter on margins, revenue is usually not sequentially up very much from Q4. Utilization, as you probably can see in the fact sheet, did drop a little bit versus Q1 of last year and versus Q4, mainly due to -- we have a short February, we have holidays in January. So, we always feel our margins squeeze in Q1 and this year it was about 0.4% a little bit more of a squeeze, but nothing dramatic that we're concerned about. We will see up tick as we move through the year.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. Sounds good. We will see you guys next week. Thank you.
Anthony Conte: Great. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Hi guys, good morning. Good job on the top line growth. Anthony, I appreciate the incremental explanations on balance sheet and cash flow. One thing I wanted to confirm on 2Q guidance is, the 2Q guidance for EPS does already exclude the tax effect. Does it not? So that would be roughly $0.06?
Anthony Conte: Correct. Yes. It's looking like $0.06, $0.07 of the impact in Q2, so it's already baked into my guidance number.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay. So, when I look at that versus the consensus that's out there, that did not have that impact, you're basically guiding inline-ish. Got it?
Anthony Conte: Inline-ish, yes, exactly.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Yes. Okay. So, question on this client concentration. I know from time-to-time we do get a lot of questions about your top two clients and how they're doing, particularly being financial services focused. Could you dive in deeper to the extent possible into sort of the growth potential of those?
Anthony Conte: Well, first off, top two are no longer financial services. I mean UBS remains our top, but Barclays is actually not number two any longer. So they've kind of stayed level as other people have grown around them. So that has changed. As far as outlook around financial services, we don't really have any new information to share with you. It's a consistent story with what we shared last time. I know that the market, there has been a lot of news around financial services, but at this point we're not seeing it. We're not hearing it. We're not only feeling it within our numbers. So we remain --
Arkadiy Dobkin: Ashwin, I would say that we have three other large banks, which became clients during the last 18, 24 months and we've grown with all of them at this point. So basically we're starting from pretty low point, but at this specific time all of them are growing fast.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Yes. I guess the question where it comes from is really particularly in financial services, there is sort of an expectation of, let's call it same-store sales not being where -- you are you starting from a low base. So that's good. But pricing pressure, things like that that you can feel, maybe more acutely, vender consolidation, any incremental commentary on that might help.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don't think we can add additional colors on what you are asking. So at this point we continue to grow in this sector. I think for significant portion of what we do there it's driven by this digital type of engagements, which we see very good level of demand. So, again, we clearly cannot guarantee that any hiccups are not going to happen in the future, but at this point we cannot share the same sentiments as some other players.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay. Understood. Last real quick question. Anthony, cash flow expectation for FY 2016, I might have missed that, could you provide the range or number?
Anthony Conte: Cash flow from operations, it's consistent with what I shared at the last call. Basically, I'm expecting cash flow from operations to be at the levels it was at in 2014. We took a little bit of a dip last year, down to about $75 million. I expect to get it up over $100 million for fiscal 2016.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
David Grossman: Thanks. Just two quick questions. First, just on the mechanics of the adjustments, Anthony, as you get to the new methodology on the stock comp or on the non-GAAP adjustments. Should we just really take the 21% and closely apply it to the entire adjustment?
Anthony Conte: You could do that roughly, David. I mean unfortunately not all of the adjustments get a tax benefit. So the way I've calculated this is actually going in and reflecting the true tax deduction that we get. And it does change and it has changed over the years. I think the net benefit for the current year was actually more like 22%, 23% benefit off the adjustments. And as you go back to history, it will change and as it goes forward, we're hoping to get more and more benefit. So I'll have to update you as we move forward. But I gave you -- for the full year, it's about $12.6 million is the benefit for the full year, and it should be about $2.5 million to $2.7 million per quarter of tax effect through 2016.
David Grossman: Okay. Thanks. And has there been any change to the stock comp for the year with any acquisition realization comp?
Anthony Conte: The stock comp charge will fluctuate, because we do have liability treatment for a few of the acquisitions, plus this year's grant included some cash settled RSUs which also have a liability treatment. So there will be a little bit of volatility, but that was baked into my stock comp guidance. So we've made some estimations on where the stock price will go and how that would be reflected. So if you use the guidance I gave you for stock comp at the beginning of the year, we're still holding to that guidance.
David Grossman: And is that about $53 million this year, that sounds all right?
Anthony Conte: It was $55 million, was about $14 million per quarter for Q2, Q3 and Q4. We saw a little bit of a break in Q1. It came in about $1.6 million lower than we expected in Q1, primarily because of where the stock price went in the mark-to-market. I'm not changing my forward look, simply because I want to maintain some of that in there for future volatility. I'm optimistic on our stock price obviously. So I want to keep the $14 million per quarter going out. So it will probably still be $53 million to $55 million is where I put it right now.
David Grossman: Got it. Then just -- I know you addressed this a moment ago in your prepared remarks about the unbilled. Is the vast majority -- because obviously the billed receivables came down quite a bit sequentially. But the unbilled went up, so you are basically flat in total. Is there some dynamic -- is that just merely the cut-off to the quarter and the amount of T&M that you carry forward into the month of April or let's say there are some other dynamic in the March quarter that drove that increase?
Anthony Conte: Well, the T&M is definitely a piece of it. It did spike -- if you look, my DSO did spike a little bit. There are a couple kind of longer payment cycles in some of our customers at the beginning of the year that are dragging out and are pushing -- kind of pushed on my unbilleds and my AR for the quarter. We're working to actively bring those down. So really, I am not overly concerned, but we've kind of re-addressed our efforts around collections within the finance there to manage that DSO back down and take care of these couple of issues that have caused the spike in this quarter.
David Grossman: Got it. Does any of this have to do -- it seems they coincide with the acquisition of Alliance. Are their billing cycles and collection cycles different than your own?
Anthony Conte: No, Alliance really didn't have too much of an impact, it was relatively small compared to our AR and unbilled. So it was really just some longer payment cycles kind of as I discussed last time when I was trying to get kind of our hands around that and manage those payment cycles down a little bit and then a couple of just clients who had some administrative delays and caused a little bit of a drag on my unbilled this quarter.
David Grossman: Okay. Got it. And then just one for you Arkadiy, if you could maybe just speak a little bit to -- now that you do a have bigger infrastructure in India, with the Alliance acquisition, are you seeing any shifts in terms of current sourcing of -- content out of India for the EPAM client base, any thoughts you have on that and how that's evolving?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Well it's still very early. It's kind of practically only one quarter in play. At the same time, we've several engagements where EPAM India is starting to serve EPAM clients. So there is already preparations, there are opportunities in pre-sales state right now. So, it's started to happen in, as we expected, but again it's very, very volatile to mention. But the reason why we brought India to EPAM map was -- we very clearly indicated that global clients need different type of services in different time zones and this is starting to benefit us.
David Grossman: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Ben Reitzes: This is Ben in for Steve this morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wondered if you could make kind of a general comment on what you're seeing from the more traditional IT vendors trying to move into higher level digital offerings, just how much success they are having? Thanks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Let me think on this small idea, and this is probably what you are asking about, competition growing from not our head-to-head traditional competitors. So and if answering this question broadly then, yes, we're seeing competition coming from all possible corners, like people who didn't participate in this more complicated deals, after some acquisitions and investments trying to play there. But again, at this level of digitalization, I would say that the market is so big and the demand is so big, and quality requirements is pretty high for delivering this that I don't think we can say that the market drastically changed for us. Specifically a lot of this -- in many cases approach is okay. We bring in like this agency type of capabilities to traditional system integrators -- integration company or bring in like some type of technology to traditional agency and trying to compete for the complex deals, which require not just creativity, but very, very strong engineering components. And from this point of view, at least how we feel, we still have advantage and it's very difficult to do it through couple acquisitions. We are bringing creative together with generally IT services, not software development services, not software engineering services. So everybody trying to play there and everybody moving in this direction. But, again, don't think it's important market yet.
Ben Reitzes: Okay. And then one more question on financial services. Relatively speaking, how much growth is coming from kind of the new digital initiatives versus legacy work and compliance as well?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, as we mentioned, it is a significant growth, but we do not provide any split and specific number. So I don't think I can answer precisely to the question. Specifically and this is very difficult to answer precisely, because it's some type of engagement, which is triggering other type of engagements and the separation line is very wide. Some companies very clearly separating this. It's interesting to know how it's happening. But we're not ready yet for that.
Ben Reitzes: Okay. Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Anil Doradla: Hey, guys. Hi, Arkadiy and Anthony. Couple of questions. Arkadiy, you talked about Alliance, why you acquired them, locations, the diversifications and all that stuff. Can you chat a little bit and tell us how that integration is coming by and how do you plan to position Alliance from a kind of the quality work and the nature of work in the bigger context of EPAM?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. That's what I chatted already about. I don't simply go into position EPAM India very differently from EPAM in general. There are some specific areas of expertise, like we mentioned when we announced the deal about very strong test capabilities and specifically test automation capabilities. Clearly that's improving our competence in this area. But in general, also we were sharing that we were looking for kind of company which would be in line with type of services EPAM provided. And from this point of view, we are not going to separate it too much from the type of work again. Would separation could be? Yes, there is convenience from time zone, from locations, and again, couple of specialization areas, but it would be very much integrated part of EPAM global delivery.
Anil Doradla: Now in the past Arkadiy, you've talked about converging the billing rates of Alliance with EPAM. What is your latest thoughts on that? Do you feel comfortable seeing Alliance billing rates pretty much in line with EPAM?
Arkadiy Dobkin: That's still clearly we are talking about three months, four months working together, it is too early. So you understand that it's impossible to change rates for existing clients. And we're working together on changing kind of these assumptions and bringing different capabilities together, but I don't think it's going to be so up within one or two or three quarters.
Anil Doradla: Very good. And Anthony you talked about a lot of work that you're doing on the DSOs front, you gave a very good explanation of the puts and takes. But when we step back and look at the big picture, 12 months from now, 24 months from now, are we talking about a new norm at these levels or are we talking about the trend which is going to be downward moving or slightly upward moving, how should we be looking at a kind of big picture over the next couple of years?
Anthony Conte: Well, absolutely, the Q1 numbers are not going to be a new trend. The Q1 numbers are too high as we have a couple specific instances that are dragging my DSO in Q1 up, higher than I want it to be. I think that I'm still targeting as kind of a new norm to keep my AR DSO kind of in the mid 50s, call it 55-ish. And from a long-term perspective, on the unbilled DSO, I'd like to get that down to kind of the mid 80s is where I'd like to see it. So right now we closed at 94 DSO. That's much too high. But we are definitely seeing a new norm in the function of kind of extended terms where our customers are pushing us for longer payment cycles, as we become a bigger part of their expense budgets and working through their procurement channels, they're pushing us a lot more on that, where they haven't in the past. So basically, it's becoming more of a balancing act for myself, which is why we are putting more efforts around kind of collection processes and finance processes to manage that, to make sure it stays in line, but we can also make sure we work with our customers accordingly.
Anil Doradla: Great. And congrats on the continued execution.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question.
James Friedman: Hi. I had two questions, I'll just ask them both upfront. The first one is on the trends in the top customers. So when I look at the fact sheet, going back for a while now, it looks like the customers outside of the top 10 are actually growing faster than the rest. So I guess my question is, because you don't actually break that out, I guess you can kind of solve for it mathematically, but what is the growth outside of the top 10 and how sustainable is that? When do you expect some refresh in the top 10 customers? That's the first question. Then on the cash flow, Anthony, I was just wondering if there's any opportunity to go to intra-quarter billing. I know that's tough, but because your explanation in your prepared remarks were about the T&M waterfall each month. So can you accelerate the billing at all to bring down the unbilled DSO? So those are my two about the top 10 trajectory and then the unbilled. Thank you.
Anthony Conte: So, I mean the top 10 dynamics, Jamie, it's interesting, because quite frankly every year those top 10, one or two move out, one or two move in. So, every year those top 10 is a slightly different mix of customers. And this year, if you look at Q1, you will notice all of my concentrations came down. What that really reflects is, we did two acquisitions last year that brought us some good name, but only a couple of -- actually none of them made it into our top 10. And I think one of them made it into our top 20. So, basically the Alliance acquisition and the NavArts acquisition brought us some good revenue, but most of that fell outside of the top 10 and top 20 accounts. So that's why you see our concentrations gets smaller for top 5 and top 10, but larger outside. So, you have that dynamic going on. Additionally, if you think historically about EPAM, a lot of our growth has always been driven outside of that top 20 as we bring on new customers that are ramping year-over-year. So it's a very balanced growth that we have. Our top accounts continue to grow, our outside grows even faster, because there are typically new logos coming in and doing a faster ramp than say what the top 10 are going to get. So, you have that dynamic all mixed into Q1 this year. Does that kind of address that question, Jamie, before I go to the --?
James Friedman: Yes, it does. Thank you.
Anthony Conte: So on the second one, as far as billing, it's something I've thought about. I assume you mean intra-month, not intra-quarter. We do monthly billing right now and with T&M, to break it down into multiple bills in one month, quite frankly I think would fall flat with our customers. Most of our customers will actually push us for one single consolidated bill each month for, in a lot of cases, covering most of the projects, except for some of the bigger accounts where you have multiple divisions. So I think if I went to them and said, I need to break it and I am now going to send you two bills a month, that would fall a little bit flat. And I'm not sure would help a whole lot, because it would actually create two separate billing cycles a month, whereas right now we're doing one process and we're getting it out. If we break into two, that could actually create additional problems and probably not keep our customers very happy, because they have to deal with it on their side.
James Friedman: Got it. Thank you for the color.
Anthony Conte: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Avishai Kantor with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Avishai Kantor: Yes. Hi, good morning. Just one quick question. Can you please talk about your plans for the healthcare vertical in 2016 and beyond, if you can share some details on that?
Anthony Conte: It's fairly open-ended question. I mean, our plans, is there something specific you like us dive into? I mean, obviously, we're looking to continue to grow and expand in that segment. But, is there some specific area that you wanted to dive into?
Avishai Kantor: I mean, are you looking to grow more into the payer and the service providers' area, which areas will be your focus basically?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So the total size of the life science and healthcare area right now is close to around $100 million. So, a bigger portion of this sitting inside of life science segment with large pharma companies where we have very interesting differentiating expertise around R&D, IT. And what we're trying to do, we're trying to benefit from this expertise, but extend across more general markets and in markets and sales, iterations of pharma companies with our offerings. But also trying to find a good overlay between life sciences and healthcare providers, on both providers and payers sides, like with all growing demand for engagement of patients and engagement of the doctors, which in our belief, creating certain opportunity how to utilize our skills in 4,000 digital engagement platforms, which we build up, working with consumer media and business information companies and have the appliances to this industry segment. So that's what we're trying to do.
Avishai Kantor: My second question, any update on your plans to slowly grow your sales capabilities?
Arkadiy Dobkin: We are growing slowly our self-capabilities. I think our -- again, we talked about it right now, we probably have already big enough group. Last, it's very tightly overlapping with clients' management accounts, management and industry expert groups. So I think we are having good progress on this.
Avishai Kantor: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Mayank Tandon: Thank you. Good morning. Anthony, just going back to the topic about utilization and pricing, could you quantify the utilization in the quarter, and also the pricing improvement you saw? And then, also looking into the guidance for fiscal 2016, how does the revenue break down between headcount growth expectations and the impact of utilization and pricing?
Anthony Conte: So utilization came in at about 76.7%. So it was a little bit down from Q4 and also down from where we were this time last year, less than 1% down, but still down. Pricing, as we said, we're kind of sticking with -- we guesstimated last time at about 4% to 5% pricing. We're pretty much staying right in that range, we're not seeing anything to indicate it's going to move dramatically off of that estimate. So pricing is remaining where we estimated it last time. And I'm sorry, could you repeat the last half of the question?
Mayank Tandon: So I was just trying to figure out the revenue breakdown between these three variables. I think you already answered the pricing question, but in terms of utilization improvement and headcount growth, how is that going to play into the fiscal 2016 guidance?
Anthony Conte: Well, I mean, utilization we try and keep in that 76% to 78% band, so I would expect to see it come up a little bit from where it is right now, as we move through the year. And as far as headcount growth, we were still saying headcount was going to grow somewhere in the 20% to 25% range for the year. We haven't really moved off of that guidance.
Mayank Tandon: That's helpful. And then just to segue into the headcount and recruiting topic, which Arkadiy mentioned as one of the challenges for everyone really involved, but what are some of the key markets or geographies that you are scaling in and would you explore other markets where you aren't present today to expand your global footprint, from a delivery perspective?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think by this point we are already practically in all reasonable markets. Yes, in some of them we have very insignificant footprint in comparison to total EPAM and in comparison specifically to some of the competitors. But we really growing practically across all our development centers. We are still growing in Eastern Europe and we are considering growing in APAC region, specifically because some revenue opportunities there and we need to have much more sizable development pool right in the region. As I mentioned, with the India operation, we have still kind of flown in and seeing how to do it better, but we definitely are planning to grow in this region too. So it's across all regions.
Mayank Tandon: Sure. And then two final questions. One on wage level impact, the timing and if you could quantify it as well, both onsite and offshore. And then how the attrition rates are trending in your business?
Anthony Conte: Attrition, right now, for Q1, was actually down a little bit, about 8% versus 10% that we saw last year. Wage inflation is looking like it's going to be in that 4% to 5% range as well. Most of that will hit us in Q2. From a timing perspective, that's almost seen a big up tick.
Mayank Tandon: Anthony, is that a blended number? If you could break it down between onsite and offshore, that will be very helpful.
Anthony Conte: No, we don't typically break down kind of wage inflation between the two locations. We look at it really at a blended rate as well.
Mayank Tandon: Sure. Thank you.
Anthony Conte: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.
Moshe Katri: Good morning. Going back to the questions about top 5 clients, maybe top 10 clients and obviously we've seen a slowdown. Was the deceleration in Barclays and UBS expected? Just to put it in another way, could this actually impact your ability to beat expectations this year, given the fact that you've had a massive -- pretty big deceleration here? Thanks.
Anthony Conte: Well, actually, I didn't say there was a deceleration in the top accounts. I just said the accounts outside of the top 10 and top 20 are growing at a faster clip. So we're seeing -- we're not seeing any deceleration on our top accounts. UBS is not necessarily decelerating. Barclays is flat, but Barclays has been flat now for two years. So really that's not much of a change. So I don't think we were saying that we are seeing deceleration on our top accounts, I think we're just saying that the accounts outside are growing at just a much faster clip, mainly because there are new customers coming in and they are ramping faster. It's more of a function of size dynamic than whether or not traction is there.
Moshe Katri: So, should we expect UBS to grow in line what we've seen in Q1 this year or are we going to see again numbers below that in terms of growth? And again, this is a question that we've been getting from investors this morning, was that the slowdown that we're seeing versus the rest of the business was expected or not?
Anthony Conte: Well, I mean, Moshe, we don't provide specific customer guidance. UBS is growing. We're still working with them quite extensively and we're seeing continued traction with that account. To a certain extent, UBS now, given the size of the account has a little bit of a -- lot of bigger numbers. And so we have grown over several years quite aggressively with them. So the trend is to see them continue to grow with us, kind of in line with company expectations. But I don't have specific growth guidance to provide on UBS.
Moshe Katri: All right. And then, Ark you mentioned three new accounts in financial services that you kind of picked up, and they're ramping. Can we get some more color on that? Are they U.S. based, are they European base et cetera?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I mentioned that it's during the last 24 months we have three potentially large clients, it's a European bank, but some of them with global -- very light global footprint as well.
Moshe Katri: That's fine. Last question about CIS, can you talk a bit about what's driving some of that growth? Is it new accounts, is this more a function of stabilization of what you're seeing there? Thanks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it went to pretty low base, so it is stabilization from this point of view. I think ruble situation is a little bit helping as well. And between these two it's kind of firm, but it's -- again it's very proportionately small footprint right now. So even one or two mid-sized deals can influence right now the growth in the region. So I wouldn't read too much to this at this point.
Moshe Katri: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.
Joseph Foresi: Hi. I was wondering, would you say that demand is actually accelerated, given the seven new deals that you talked about and are all those clients new to the digital engagements?
Arkadiy Dobkin: You know, like I was pretty often repeating that we're still a small player in this market, even with our practically over $1 billion run rate. And seven -- definitely it's working for us, but I don't think we can justify any statement of acceleration for the whole market with this decision. So that would be my answer. And what was the second question?
Joseph Foresi: Were all the clients new to digital?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Not all of them new -- okay, can you specify more? You are asking, if this clients never did digital projects or all of them kind of coming to us because of digital or shrink?
Joseph Foresi: Yes, and more likely, are they doing -- had they been working with a different provider in digital and moved over to you or they're new to sort of doing digital?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It's a combination of all of this. Some of them moving to us from competitors, some of them with new initiatives, and for some of them it's very new initiative. Some of them have already good experience. So fixed assets and no fixed assets. So, all of the play.
Joseph Foresi: Got it. Okay. And then, regarding Europe in general, maybe you could just talk about your growth expectations for some of your European clients, particularly given some of the macro climate things that we've seen in the news?
Anthony Conte: I mean, our expectations, we don't really give, again, guidance by region, but we expect kind of all our regions to grow in line with the guidance that we've given. So we don't really provide any specific geographic guidance, but we remain optimistic on Europe, as well as North America.
Joseph Foresi: Okay. And then --
Arkadiy Dobkin: And it's difficult to say that it's more easy to predict what's happening in Europe versus North America right now, especially in North America, as well for U.S. and Canada, and nothing perfect right now anyway.
Joseph Foresi: Got it. Okay. And then, the pricing pressure that was kind of cited earlier in the call, where was that pricing pressure coming from exactly?
Anthony Conte: I don't think we alluded to any pricing pressure. I think we're just saying we're not seeing price up ticks as we've seen in the past year. So we're still seeing some improvement on our pricing, it is just not as optimistic, because it's partially impacted.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think I mentioned something between these lines, mostly on the general statement, which you were asking before. There are general concerns, there are potential macroeconomic pressure across Europe and North America and with all things which happen in -- as we know what's happened in Europe and what's -- election campaign in U.S. So it all can put in additional pressure practically on all clients. What we say, despite of all of this, with our focus on specific subset on the market, it's not really impacting us. That was what I wanted to express, so I am sorry if it was confusing.
Joseph Foresi: I got it. So, basically what you're saying is that you're getting the price increases, you're just not getting anything above you would expect, I guess it's probably --
Arkadiy Dobkin: At least mitigation this result, impacting our pricing situation.
Joseph Foresi: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of our time allowed for questions this morning. I'll now turn the floor over to Mr. Dobkin for any final remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you everybody for participating today. Again, it was a good quarter in our view, and we're looking forward to talking to you in three months. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the EPAM Systems Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the conference over to Ms. Lilya Chernova, Investor Relations. Thank you Ms. Chernova, you may now begin.
Lilya Chernova: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company’s fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. If you have not, a copy is available in the Investor section on our website at epam.com. The speakers for today’s call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Anthony Conte, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today’s call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company’s earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Arkadiy?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Lilya. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.  First, I hope our results addressed some immediate concerns about the profitability of EPAM aiding to the recent stream of an unexpected news. I am pleased to confirm that we have been able to navigate through our multiple challenges of 2015, including growing the level of SMEs during the last quarter in regards to weaknesses of financial services sector and continuous negative FX impact on reported results in particular.  So let me highlight now the most important facts for 2015. Q4 revenue increased by 29% year over year to $260 million and in constant currency it represents 34.3% growth. More importantly, our organic growth representing 24% increased over last year, which translated into 29% constant currency growth.  It was also exciting for us to cross $250 million in Q4 that brings us to a run rate price of symbolic $1 billion annualized revenue mark to play [ph] this year. One more data point to mention, that last quarter was our 25th consecutive quarter of over 20% organic year-over-year growth and 16th since our IPO four years ago. I think it’s a good reference point for EPAM including into Fortune 100 fastest growing public companies in 2015 where we were recognized as the fastest growing firm in IT services segment.  In Israel, we are closing the year with $914 million in annual revenue which is 25.2% growth in USD and 33% in constant currency over our 2014 results. And while it’s obviously disappointing to lose 55 million due to FX headwinds we’re going to report our strong organic growth which represented 23% for the full year in USD and 31% in constant currency.  So at this point and before turning to Anthony to provide much more detailed financials on our 2015 results and 2016 guidance, I would like to talk a little bit more on the bigger picture. To remind what was in our focus during the last periods, what our progress to date was and what would be our focus and key efforts in the near future. First of all, three years ago, we decided that we plan to target the specific subset of IT market which was driven by now probably much or are used by still real term as a digital transformation disruption. We plan to benefit from our strong software engineering background built over the years of sharing top software and technology companies and helping them to develop new products and solutions.  We also realized three years ago that to be successful and penetrating that market segment, we would have to reach significant gaps in multiple areas, including specific delivery capabilities and much more advanced account managing practices.  Only such players who would have a chance to play in that fast growing market we should potentially reach a site of $80 billion by 2018 according to analyst prediction. Then three years ago we set an internal goal to double our revenue by 2015 and identified a number of specific focused areas to make it happen.  The last couple of years were really challenging and eventful years for EPAM and much work the rest of the world, from continued political conflicts and currency headwinds to shits within some of our large customers results and links to our performance.  Especially, I would like to highlight the following facts on EPAM’s continuous evolution and EPAM current state. Based on our plans we started to build advanced digital strategy and experiences and capabilities about three years ago. And we started to do that with a very strong focus on integrating these capabilities into EPAM’s historically mature engineering DNA. We believe that while it would be much more difficult to do that in integrated way, it should bring also some strong competitive advantage for us eventually.  The journey is not finished yet. However in 2015 we saw strong repeatable patterns in how we engaged in new deals and how we started to execute them. Our digital engaging practice visibly matured during last year and become a recognizable force among our clients and many new engagements. Strong capabilities such as software design for example started to play more important role in specific situation. And finally, in addition NavigationArts with their strong focus on content technologies strengthened our leadership position in digital solution space.  Those changes at EPAM combined with our investments in industry specific competencies as well as data and advanced technology services, allows us to differentiate and expand significantly. First of all, across our fastest growing in 2015 verticals which are travel and consumer and media and entertainment. Those grew 36.5% and 31.5% year over year accordingly. That digital focus allows us to add four out of top 10 global retailers as clients and now we have 15 of top 100. In most cases, we are helping them with a range of digital transformation initiatives and in many cases like Tyres [ph] Sephora and Mary Kay among others, those initiatives are driving significant revenue acceleration and very strategic in nature.  Similarly, we are working with five of top 10 global media companies, including one of the largest Liberty Global and also with Intel in consumer vertical, we work with largest online agency in the world and the largest global hotel chain, for eight years, along with two of the top 5 low cost global airlines.  Turning to financial services, which continue to be our top vertical by revenue, we’re seeing a further diversification of services revenue, a significant growth driven through digital transformation initiatives. In 2015, we added four significant financial services clients and we continue to expand our digital engagement efforts. For example, our focus on wealth management has helped our customers reimagine their role in an extremely competitive arena of financial services and to successfully defend their market share against new entrants.  With our growing ability to lead the transformation by providing end to end capabilities from aviation to services and user experience and global engineering, we are able to grow our digital platforms like I mentioned already wealth management, as a more productized service and to do so simultaneously in multiple geographies.  Digital engagement for financial services expand today globally with team supporting customer programs in the US, UK, Nordic, APAC, and now in Middle East. In 2015 we also took on the challenge of driving industry change with continued investment in trading platforms and the introduction of Blockchain hedge accounting and other specific solutions. While the overall growth of financial services was only 15%, it will eliminate an impact of Russian market, the growth will be up to 23% and in constant currency 27% over 2014 results.  To complete our vertical stories, let me spend a couple of minutes on our all these focus areas, software and hi-tech and in our most recent industry and trends life sciences and healthcare. Software and hi-tech continues to be an important component of our client portfolio. While we are enjoying the work in the segment for many years, it’s also critical for us to stay on top of technology trends as well as – as experience first hand of the most advanced processes and methodologies related to the delivery of the most complex and advanced solution.  We’re glad that we continue to have a very healthy growth rate of 22.2% in this segment which allowed us to keep our engineering skills very much up to date and bring those back to many – remaining engagements across our vertical portfolio.  Finally, about our smallest today but fastest growing vertical: life science and healthcare. While we provided services in this area in the past our most strategic entrance happened just in 2014 when we acquired four industry expertise in several key accounts.  During 2015, we put our initial focus on expanding into few existing accounts. While it’s still too early to make a final conclusion, we’ve already seen the first results of shares [ph]. In addition, combining industry subject matter expertise with our advanced digital and data capabilities, allowed us to win several new very interesting clients in this market. One example of our success would be Human Longevity Inc, a company with a recognition to create the world’s largest and most comprehensive database of whole genome. In addition, each of our business also include a genomic clinical research program, which uses whole genome sequence analysis, advanced clinical imaging and innovative machine learning along with the curated personal health information to deliver the most complete picture of individual health.  When you have a unique combination of capabilities with understanding both science and advanced technologies, allowed us to learn such an opportunity which in turn became our fastest growing account in 2015 across this vertical. In Q4 our growth for the portfolio was over 45% and today we are involved in providing services to six of the top 10 global life science companies and to five of the top 10 largest healthcare vendors which create very interesting for opportunity to penetrate.  Now I think it also would be helpful to take a closer look at our client base beyond the vertical boundary, because while in general the number of top brands in which vertical sector is important, it doesn’t provide a comprehensive picture about the level of diversification, penetration and about expansion opportunity, the potential should be able to realize with those accounts.  So let us talk a bit about that. First of all, we do believe we have a pretty healthy client concentration ratios with our top clients, representing 14.2% of our revenue, top 5’s 32.6%, top 20, 54.3% and top 50, 70%. In results as such balance, for example, our lowest one of 2014 top 10 clients, you know TriZetto was acquired by Cognizant, didn’t really affect our growth numbers.  By the end of 2015, among our accounts is annual revenue of 1 million, we had about 50 accounts representing largest 2000 global companies with 25 of them, we had revenue under 3 million annually, 7 of them, we provided with between 3 million and 5 million services, with four between 5 million and 10 million and with another four, between 10 million and 20 million. Finally, we had six such clients with revenue between 20 million and 50 million per year and as you know just one was above $100 million. We do believe that majority of those accounts should be able to provide for us lending opportunities to expand. We expect natural shifting of the current budgets towards new digital and data platforms which should allow such expansion even results in expanding clients’ current IT budgets.  As we’ve seen this happening in among growing number of our other clients. For example, today in 20 of our top 25 accounts, there is at least one significant digital transformation program ongoing and in five of our top 10 accounts, the digital platform representing significant proportion in total revenue. We expect such services to grow over 2016 and take on even more work around digital products and platform engineering and integration across existing client base.  We’d like to state also that while we do believe we have significant opportunity across our existing client base, we continue to bring new logos [ph] and expect them to support and existed to the ratio of about 10% of next year revenue to be growth from new clients.  To finish my highlights for 2015, would like to say that last year was also a year of significant expansion of our delivery capabilities geographically, making our delivery platform more balanced and diversified across the globe and across the time zones. We, at the end of 2015, had the largest in overall global footprint resources in 25 countries and with over 16,000 delivery professionals worldwide. We grew in China with people and with new global clients iteration as well, added the development centers in Godalaha [ph] and Prague and what it was a significant event for us, we came to India with the acquisition of our global services at the very end of last year. And today we can report of really the direct clients which have large and distributed teams across Europe and India.  Looking forward to 2016, we have seen strong level of demand from both current and prospective customers. While demand continues in our core engineering and advanced technology services, as mentioned before we are experiencing stronger shift to our services required combined digital product and platform engineering and integration capabilities. We do believe EPAM is in good position to take an advantage in this type of shifts and this type of demand. We invest and continuously invest in venture integrated services, including customer experience in digital platform, data analytics and cloud and service design. We also as many others believe that deepen the understanding of IoT platforms and related data analytics services would become much more important in the near future, which is another area of continuous investment for us in 2016.  The combination of our solutions and our vertical focus should position us well this year to take advantage of our shifting services market.  With that, I will turn to Anthony to provide more details on our financial results and 2016 guidance. 
Anthony Conte: Thank you, Ark and good morning everyone. I will spend a few minutes taking you through the fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. Then I will talk more about our outlook for 2016.  Let me start by saying that we are pleased with our overall results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. Our business is well positioned for growth but with the current instability in the marketplace there still remains some uncertainty. But as Ark mentioned, we have sustained over 20% organic growth for every quarter since IPO, continue to improve that the fundamentals at EPAM are strong.  Q4 was another solid quarter of revenue, closing at $260 million, 28.7% over last year and 10.3% over prior quarter. This includes the impact of Alliance Global and NavigationArts which contributed slightly over $10 million resulting in organic revenue of $215 million and organic growth of 24% year over year and 7.6% sequentially.  Currency continues to be our big piece of our story as headwinds have continued, compressing our organic Q4 revenue by about 6%, meaning in constant currency terms, we would have grown 29% over Q4 2014 and 6% sequentially. For the full year of 2015 we closed at $914 million of reported revenue, 25% over last year after 8% currency headwinds, meaning, constant currency growth was 33%. Organically we ended just over $900 million or 23% growth but in constant currency would have been 31%.  North America, our largest geography, represents 53% of our full year revenues and is up 40% from Q4 and 32% year-over-year, with constant currency growth of 43% and 35% respectively. Europe was up 24% year-over-year and 23% in Q4, representing 39% of full year revenue. In constant currency terms, EU would've been up 32% year-over-year and 28% in Q4, reflecting the impact of both the euro and sterling volatility over the past year.  For APAC, we saw 26% growth year-over-year and 30% in constant currency. CIS was down 23% for the year and 16% compared to Q4 2014 and that represents under 5% of revenue in Q4. In constant currency terms, the region would have seen about 9% growth for the quarter and 11% for the year.  Our customer concentration numbers for Q4 remained fairly consistent with past quarters and for the full year, our top 20 accounts grew 23% year-over-year and 30% in constant currency, representing 54% of revenue. All other clients outside of our top 20 grew 28% year over year to 39% in constant currency. From our IPO date to today, we have managed to reduce the revenue concentration of our top 20 accounts from 60% down to 54% while maintaining consistent mid-20% growth.  Turning to our expenses, we completed the year with over 18,000 employees, an increase of about 30% compared to 2014, including about 1200 employees from Alliance Global.  Currency generated some benefits to the cost of revenue in the quarter when compared to prior year. There was approximately 7% constant currency benefit versus Q4 2014 and the allocation of our currencies across our expense base remained fairly consistent. Utilization for the quarter was at 77%, up 30% from Q3 and the full year ended at 75%.  GAAP income from operations increased 32% year-over-year to represent 12.2% of revenue in the quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the fourth quarter increased 54% over prior year, mainly driven by the significant increase in the average closing price of the stock. Additionally, 38% of the total Q4 charge and 23% of the increase is related to the acquisitions.  Our non-GAAP income from operations for the quarter after adjustments increased 30% over prior year to $47 million, representing 18% of revenue. For the full year, non-GAAP income from operations was up 29% to $158.7 million or 17.4% of revenue. Our effective tax rate for the quarter and full year came in at 20.4%. For the quarter, we generated $0.78 of non-GAAP EPS and $0.52 of GAAP EPS based on approximately 53 million shares diluted outstanding. For the full year, we generated $2.73 of non-GAAP EPS, $0.07 above guidance and 23% above 2014. GAAP EPS was $1.62, 16% above 2014 based on 52 million weighted shares diluted outstanding.  Our balance sheet remained strong. We finished the quarter with approximately $199 million of cash plus $30 million in time deposit accounts. During the fourth quarter, operating activities generated approximately $11 million of cash and for full year we had $76 million of operating cash flows. Unbilled revenues were at $96 million at December 31. Accounts receivable were $175 million and DSO ended the quarter at approximately 53 days.  And now for our guidance, for the full year 2016 revenue growth will be at least 26% after factoring in about 3% estimated currency headwinds, meaning, constant currency growth will be 29%. Organic revenue is becoming harder to separate due to the full integration of NavigationArts and we anticipate, once Alliance Global is fully integrated during Q2 2016, a clear separation will be very difficult. However, our initial plan does include the impact of both 2015 acquisitions and excluding them, organic constant currency growth would be at least 23%. Since currency will remain a theme in financial results for 2016, our assumptions are that the currency mix will remain materially similar to 2015 for both revenue and expense. For Q1 2016 revenue will be at least $258 million or 29% growth after 3% currency headwinds, meaning, constant currency growth will be at least 31%. Organic revenue will be at least 23% constant currency. Adjusted income from operations for the full year will remain in our guidance range of 16% to 18%. Stock compensation expense is expected to be around $55 million with $13 million in Q1 and $14 million in Q2 through four. Amortization of intangibles will be about $6.5 million or about $1.6 million per quarter. GAAP EPS will be at least $0.43 in Q1 and at least $2.05 for the full year. Non-GAAP EPS will be at least $0.70 in Q1 and at least $3.20 for the full year. With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to the operator and open up for Q&A. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Grossman with Stifel.
David Grossman : Anthony, I am wondering if you could just touch a little bit on the cash flows. It looks like they were down in the quarter and down year over year. I am wondering, is that a function of perhaps the acquisitions or maybe just timing on the quarter?
Anthony Conte: Sure. Hi, David, it is primarily a timing issue. We are seeing just some extended terms from a lot of our clients, people are pushing for longer 60 to 90-day payment terms, so you see little bit of a bump up in my overall DSO. It pushed some of our end of year receivables into January. We actually collected about $35 million in January alone. As far as cash flows outside of AR, if you noticed our tax payments – if you look at our cash flow, tax payments are going up. My cash tax rate as we have more people sitting in US, UK, I am seeing higher cash tax going out the door, so that also impacted my cash flow when you look at it year-over-year. ADS does impact my cash flow but that's not within the operating cash flows, that’s not really down within the investing section. 
David Grossman : So can you give us a few of the parameters on for modeling 2016 free cash flow in terms of what you expect for CapEx, cash taxes or any other working capital items that may affect the difference between net income and cash flow?
Anthony Conte: Sure. From a CapEx perspective, we’re forecasting around $19 million, $20 million worth of CapEx and as far as cash taxes go, we are looking at roughly a 20% cash tax rate. 
David Grossman : So no real diversions there –
Anthony Conte: Cash tax rate has actually crept up a couple points over the past couple of years. When we first IPOed and stock options started to vet, and get exercised, we saw a larger than normal benefit from stock option exercises as a deduction to our taxes which has now leveled itself off. And so therefore that is coming down, therefore bringing cash tax rate up a bit. So that is impacting my cash flow.
David Grossman : On a year-over-year basis but it looks like it’s adjusting with your GAAP guide of 21, right?
Anthony Conte: Yes. It’s becoming more in line with the effective tax rate.
David Grossman : And then just a question quickly on pricing, just wondering, is the pricing environment similar to what we experienced or is your expectations of ’16 look like ‘15 and should we expect to get the typical growth to pin [ph] revenue of around 6% similar to what we’ve gotten historically?
Anthony Conte: We’re actually being a little bit more conservative around pricing for 2016 just based on what we’re seeing in the marketplace. It’s still that early in the year for us to fully vet out what everything is going to settle at, that usually is kind of towards the end of the first quarter. And so we are actually looking at more – 3% to 4% is what we’re building into our models just because of everything that’s happening in the economy these days. 
David Grossman : And just finally then, I know you gave the top customers, I think those with growth rates for the year, do you happen to have those for the quarter on a constant currency basis for the different categories that you disclosed?
Anthony Conte: You mean the constant currency growth for what? Like the top 5, top 5, as such?
David Grossman : Exactly, yes, the top clients, top 5, top 10 exactly for the fourth quarter?
Anthony Conte: Do give me one second. Okay. For the top 5, oh, I have it for the full year, I didn’t fill for the actual quarter, I can recalculate those for you if you need. For the year, the top 5 grew 31% in constant currency, top 10 was 30%, top 20 was 27%. 
David Grossman : How about the top client –
Anthony Conte: Top – I mean UBS? 36%. 
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar : I just wanted to ask about what this mean in our checks [ph] client specific response to the current environment, the macro uncertainty and so on, and sometimes from an IT budget standpoint, it seems that the impact on demand, sometimes the impact on pricing, is that what is causing your cash flow terms to move out and is that more of a broad comment or is that a narrow – client specific type of comment?
Anthony Conte: It’s more of a broader comment. Historically my payment terms have been kind of 30 to 45 days and most what we’re seeing within the marketplace is lot of people are pushing for 60 to 90 day payment terms and we’re having to move a little bit just to basically -- larger clients have extended terms as far as like 45 to 60 days, beyond our normal 30 day. That's why you're seeing a little bit of a creep on our DSO and a little bit of extension of our collections. It’s part of the normal marketplace, I am not talking long, I am talking instead of our normal 30 to 45 days, 45 to 60, sometimes up to 90 days. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar : On a plan specific basis, okay, I understand. This may be more for you guys, an impact that you guys are getting larger at certain times. 
Anthony Conte: Exactly and that we’re dealing with larger clients who have in a lot of cases very standard terms, if they don't accept anything under say 60 days, that’s the trend that we are seeing. So I am feeling a little bit of upward pressure on my DSO as we deal with larger margin clients, more procurement groups and things of that nature.
Ashwin Shirvaikar : And a question, Ark, appreciate your commentary on sort of the bigger picture. As you look at how the environment is evolving and you compare that with the product set and the service portfolio that you're bringing to market, do you see that there's a good match, or do you see a need for ongoing investment? I know there are normal ongoing investments but ongoing investments at a particularly high level in the coming quarters that you have to invest in certain areas?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Ashwin, when you are saying at high level, what do you mean exactly?
Ashwin Shirvaikar : Well, are we going to – I guess first part of the question was with regards to, is there a good match in terms of what you bring into market versus what you're seeing a demand for? And if not, what sorts of investments will you have to make?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think we’re improving the major component of this but as you mentioned, so this is I think kind of common statement there, situation is changing in very much like -- some years ago when we were implementing systems it was kind of longer term of life for them, now it’s customer engagement situation can drive, when we’re talking about mostly consumer oriented systems, so the change is happening too fast. So this level of investment required is very high. So I think while we kind of sinking the gaps in some places, we see some gaps growing in other ones. Like for example, internet of things which we mentioned today as well, in our opinion would change the whole landscape pretty strongly. So it would require – short answer, it would require a lot of investments in our opinion where we’re going. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar : I am trying to get to a little bit more of a business model question, where you’ve had this services versus need for a product, need for a software type of a look discussion in the past. As you think of exactly those sorts of things, and more internet of things, maybe wearables areas like that, do you see the need for more of a product, or platform type investment, is what I am trying to get at?
Arkadiy Dobkin: And this terminology is sort of pretty sizable, what is the product here, what is required for them but we’re definitely seeing broader needs for solution type of platforms which would help to accelerate startup phases of the projects and also we’ve experienced during the last couple of years when we went through dozens of corners or consumer engagement type of implementations, we’ve seen a lot of opportunities for some level of amortization through accelerators development. So that would be happening. So yeah, I think one of the key advantages we’re seeing at EPAM that we can actually put relatively complete custom implementations of aggregated platform for this changing environment. 
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Steve Milunovich of UBS.
Steve Milunovich : Thank you. What kind of headcount growth are you thinking about in ’16 and what sort of utilization rate?
Anthony Conte: Headcount should be 20%, 25% and utilization should be around 77%. We always target getting into the 76 to 78 range. So we’re kind of modeling right on the middle of the range there.
Steve Milunovich : And you’ve obviously got robust guidance and it is a difficult environment. You talked about having 90% type visibility over 12 months. Are you building some buffer into this? Are you taking into account a risk of pricing pressure or some companies pulling back some business temporarily, just kind of wondering your confidence level?
Anthony Conte: Well, I mean we have a high confidence with the numbers that we’ve shared with you so – but as I mentioned earlier on pricing we are being a little bit more conservative on our estimates there just given the current environment. And generally speaking we’re very confident with the numbers that we’ve come out for guidance. 
Steve Milunovich : And I was curious for an update on Google, you talked quite a bit about it at the last day, analyst day, and I thought it was very interesting. Any update in terms of what you’re doing for them or how much that business is growing? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: It’s growing but what we’re doing for them, I don’t think we can talk in details. But it’s the second largest account right now for EPAM, that’s what we provided. 
Steve Milunovich : It’s the second largest account?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. 
Steve Milunovich : And could you be specific in terms of what sort of growth you expect from UBS in ’16?
Anthony Conte: We don’t really share specific client growth expectations. 
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.
Jason Kupferberg : I want to talk a little bit about investments that you touched on before, just to get a little bit more specific there. I mean if we look at the full guidance for 2016, I know the bottom line is growing somewhat slower than the top line, I think maybe a little bit of that is tax and a little bit of that is share count but it would also seem like the implied operating margin guide is maybe for a little bit of year-over-year decline, I know you’re still going to be in the 15% to 18% target range but you were above the midpoint of that in 2015. So is that a fair conclusion that, that maybe you’re in the kind of lower to middle part of the 16% to 18% as opposed to the upper part, just given some of investments you need to make?
Anthony Conte: Our overall guidance is just coming to that -- into that range and we do continue to make investments. And some of the over-performance that you saw in 2015 was, having some help from currency which we don't necessarily factor that into the forecast that we will get that benefit, we forecast relatively neutral on currency benefits. And then we have a variety of things that we want to continue to invest into the business, to continue to support the growth. And that's really all factored into those numbers. So that’s how we come back to 16% to 18% within the range. We don’t really specify where in the range we’re going to land.
Jason Kupferberg : And I know you don’t make specific projections on individual clients. But if you look at what you want to segment in this top 5 or top 10, do you think the growth rates for those groups in constant currency can be sustained in 2016? 
Anthony Conte: Absolutely. Yes, I mean we’re very confident, we have a very good client list right now. And we definitely feel there is still lot of opportunity within our client list and given the size of the companies and the size of the marketplace we see a lot of potential for growth. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: What you can do – you can look to historical numbers and these ratios were pretty stable over the last several years. So our assumption is that would be in line for the next couple of years as well but as a follow up, now predicting things would be very difficult and we’ll see. But we will also – I mentioned today number of large clients, we have an opportunity for growing. So we kind of have pretty stable and interesting existing client base to benefit from.
Jason Kupferberg : Just lastly on the supply side of the business, any latest statistics you can share in terms of your cap rate on campus offers, just in general commentary on recruiting environment? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I would say very general statements like you saw our attribution rate and wage inflation which is a little bit lower than traditionally we’ve had during the last several years, which probably is a function of some situation in Eastern Europe but general environment is still very difficult and very competitive for any talent acquisition and especially the talent which we’re looking for. So it’s – as I repeat practically on each call, really the biggest global problems everybody has, and we don’t see any simplification here. Basically for our growth right balance between business and actually delivery still remain the main focus I would say.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from James Friedman of SIG.
James Friedman : Hi, let me echo my congratulations. I had a couple of questions, first, Ark, with your helpful disclosure about the 25, that do 3 million to 7 -- want to ask about the six in the $20million to $50 million range. Is my question, is in that top six, the 6 that do 20 million to 50 million, just below the top one, is there any anticipation that they will break through the $100 million threshold and if so, at what term? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don’t think any of them will break to $100 million in the next year and maybe two, but couple of them have a potential for this type of business. And I think even below this top 5 there are clients with such potential as well. But again it’s not going to happen this year. 
James Friedman : I also want to ask, Ark, about your commentary that 10% of the revenue will come from new customers. If I heard that right, is that -- could you give us some profile of where you think those will come from either on a vertical basis or on a geographic basis, will it be similar to the current profile in the company?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So it would be much in line with our current vertical focuses. So it’s a combination of this, because we’re bringing some very interesting products through new sales but some of them came in actually to us through acquisitions and it would be kind of unresponsible to not focusing on them but put the risk – people to farms [ph] also down. So from this point of view, we expect close to this, around this percentage to be brought this year, from as long as which we’ve practically started during the previous 12 months. And that’s pretty much in line with our historical numbers too. But depreciated – this would be like spread, or this would be very similar to what we have today. 
James Friedman : And Anthony, just one housekeeping, I thought you were going kind of quick there when you said the unbilled. What was that number again, the unbilled -- I don't know if you call unbilled revenue, unbilled receivables for the quarter? 
Anthony Conte: The unbilled closed at $96 million, the accounts receivable was $175 million. 
James Friedman : Does that $96 million compared to the $13 million in the Q3 or was that $13 -- 
Anthony Conte: No, I mean Q3 unbilled was – I’ll call the number off hand – it was $104 million in Q3, so it dropped from 104 million to 96 million.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Arvind Ramnani of Gordon Haskett.
Arvind Ramnani : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Yes, I wanted to ask about the nature of work in digital and this is a little bit of a follow-up to the question Ashwin asked. So your digital work, I know it's typically project based and the needs of your clients, each of your clients is pretty unique. But are you getting to a point now where you have a platform or a solution that is targeted to a specific area where you can take work from one client and apply to a group of clients? I guess what I'm trying to get is some of the work that you're doing for your top 5 or top 10 clients, do you have the ability to package some of that expertise and send it to other potential clients? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, we’ll take another discussion to define what a solution product expertise and all that stuff but in very high level I would say that we’re definitely moving forward with a more productized – where productized you need to understand in where the growth sense of this will. And I mentioned today on wealth management. We have similar effort and similar kind of reusable assets around our retail corners proposals. We're also working on multiple accelerators around integration efforts. So – and that was already this year and going to be in the next year, big portion of our investments as well. So it has become very important for us and for the depreciation story.
Arvind Ramnani : That's helpful, and just a follow-up question. I wanted to get a sense of your medium to longer-term plans for your India operation. Given that India has a lot of scale, do you expect India office will become the most significant part of your headcount and I guess, kind of a part two of the same question is, as the revenues from your top 10 accounts are growing and the average size of your large client is getting larger, is there some need to do lower end work and will you look to kind of send some of the work to a geography like India? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: First of all, I think it would be much more comfortable to tell you kind of extended answer little bit later because we need the actual work before we run with new acquisitions and specifically new for us geographies. At the same time when we were making decision about Alliance Global we kept very specific clients and very specific profile of the company, and at this point we’re pretty much satisfied and didn’t see any unexpected but it doesn’t mean that we’re doing this from the perspective to replicate exactly what large Indian vendors do. So Alliance Global has more technology profile similar to EPAM. So they have very specific expertise in automation tech in which we’re already benefitting from and going to benefit more. So from this perspective, we’re not looking for expanding dramatically in low level of work. So I think the payout which we were having historically from our clients when we were doing more complex stuff, still pretty weak and the percentage of more complex work, more digital work, will be changing, there is definitely shift in the client budget. And I think for our growth we will be focusing still on more high end part of the drugs. 
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Anil Doradla of William Blair.
Anil Doradla : Hey guys. A couple of questions. So on the call we talked about the macro in certain ways, you talked about conservative pricing, you’ve talked about some of the accounts receivable and DSOs. But Anthony and Ark, can you specifically talk about -- when you talk about some macro weakness, where are you exactly seeing it? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: I would like to joke [ph] it’s in our competitors reports. So in general, like on high level I think for us environment is very similar to previous years. So it might be very slight signs of changes, maybe not, it’s very difficult for us to identify but again as usual this year I would like to repeat that our size of the company and now with ability to the market not necessarily but would be in line with the companies 10 times bigger than us. So we work in very specific subset of the IT market which is high growth. But we’re responsible and we see some clients especially like if you think about FX situation in Europe and for some global companies reporting indoors, paid in euro type of revenue and paying us indoors. There are some cases like this, which are very specific and this is like single cases. Anthony would like to add something.
Anthony Conte: I mean I had a more general answer. You talked about macro uncertainties and weakness, and really it’s everywhere. I mean, just look at the news and just look at what’s happening and just overall the world, and so our conservatism is coming from looking at, yes other reports that have been coming out but also from just reading the news on a regular basis and just looking at what’s happening in the world.
Anil Doradla : So it sounds like there is a degree of conservativeness, you are not really seeing weakness, that’s how I'm interpreting this? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: We’ve seen like higher level of unpredictability, even like if you think about, with full year results, we’ve seen a very specific effects trend while for the last two years all these assumptions were wrong, and surprisingly. So we’re seeing the same environment. So from this point of view it’s not like we’re worried about something what’s happening but level of unpredictability is pretty high. 
Anil Doradla : Okay. Now, the acquisition of Alliance and the mix of that, that might have a little dilutive effect on the average revenue per employee. Can you talk about how you look at the Alliance acquisition from a pricing point of view going forward? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Back to my previous answer, I think we need to work closely but fully in longer term plans we would like to bring the pricing closer to EPAM standards. But we will have to kind of watch what’s happening and how it would be working. At this point we’re already starting to engage our Indian operation in more broader EPAM client base, kind of trying to understand how it works, how client – EPAM client acceptance is. And again we will have much more detailed answer probably in couple of quarters. 
Anil Doradla : And finally, if I can squeeze one final in. Your largest customer is undergoing consolidation in terms of its vendor list -- IT vendor list. How are you guys positioned, I'm presuming that you guys will come out well, but any color on that? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we hope that we will come out well there as you said so, I don’t think anything else should be added. So we don’t see any specifically dangerous signs in the direction. 
Operator: Thank you. We have time for last final question and our last question is from Alex Veytsman of Monness, Crespi, Hardt.
Alex Veytsman : Yes. Hi guys, just a quick question on labor sourcing as we look to 2016. Can you give us an idea as to which markets will potentially be improved or whether enhanced in terms of labor sourcing and which markets will decline in terms of the number of delivery professionals? 
Anthony Conte: None of our markets will decline. At this point any market that we are currently in is looking at growth from a labor sourcing perspective. And some of our more traditional markets, Belarus, will continue to be one of our fastest growing areas in absolute headcount and then some of our smaller and newer locations if you think about like Poland, Hungary, you look at what we are doing in Mexico, those guys will grow at probably a faster percentage cliff. India, now that’s part of the geo mix, so that will grow, a very balanced. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we set specific targets for each market but I don’t think we’re disclosing this on this level of detail, also from the moment which we did in the last couple of years, I think it’s pretty obvious that we do in some diversification from former Soviet Union, more to European Union and now globally to APAC, China, India, they’re growing as well. But the regional decline, there is practically no status quo in any of these markets.  End of Q&A
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dobkin for any closing comments.
Arkadiy Dobkin: As usual, thank you very much for spending time this morning with us. So it was a good year, so we hope that we will prove that 2016 is going to be a good year too but definitely not going to be – I would like to also remind that we are organizing our second annual investor day on March 9 in New York City and if you’re interested to see more information about EPAM, more details and client stories, welcome to join and you can find information on our website or contact directly Lilya. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the EPAM Systems Third Quarter 2015 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the conference over to Miss Lilya Chernova, Investor Relations. Thank you Miss Chernova, you may now begin.
Lilya Chernova: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company’s third quarter 2015 results. If you have not, a copy is available in the Investor Relations section on our website at epam.com. The speakers for today’s call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Anthony Conte, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today’s call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company’s earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Arkadiy?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Lilya. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today to share with you our third quarter results. The large portion of the light portion EPAM revenue generated outside of the United States and with corresponding significant currency headwinds all around the globe, it was not an easy quarter for us to navigate. At the same time, during this period we continue to outperform the market by posting significant and consistent growth. While our Q3 revenue of $236 million represent 22% topline and 8.4% sequential growth, our growth in constant currency was 31% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. Overall despite the recent acceleration of currency headwinds which was $32.7 million investment in part on our Q3 revenue just since our last earnings call and we’ll have an estimated $3 million embarked on Q4, we are confident that our 2015 performance will still be inline with our additional guidance. Anthony will provide a more detailed update on our financial performance in the quarter as well as full 2015 guidance. From a strategy perspective, we continue to follow the plans that we laid out in previous quarters, focussing largely on expanding – EPAM have the capabilities in our effort to help clients as they transition into becoming digital businesses. As we incorporate a much more consultative approach into our mix of services, we expect that our top clients will continue to grow significantly always as well as driving engagements further up with a value chain. From a vertical perspective, we are pleased with the growth in our newer focus areas as well as continuing strength from our established business and financial services, business information and media and travel and consumer industries. Our largest vertical banking and financial services grew over 20% in constant currency and we expect our digital business there particularly in wealth management. While we anticipate additional opportunities that will diversify or traditionally in that segment over the next several quarters. Accelerating growth in our travel and consumer and business information and media is also being driven by increase in the digital platform work. We are expecting it to continue especially as the benefits of the new skills we developed organically and via recent acquisitions we’ll be merging with our current capabilities and be realized by our clients. We see significant potential upticks as a result of both existing accounts as well the acceleration of new logo acquisitions. We also continue to see growth from our independent software vendor segment at 20% in constant currency. However, there is a very interesting challenge now in how to draw the line between traditional issue segment and many of our strong technology driven clients with a focus on generating revenue based on the business services and solutions versus selling software licenses or subscriptions directly. We will continue to evaluate how it categorise customer gross, our verticals to address this boring line. One of the most interesting industry stories is a significant growth we have seen within our Life Science and Healthcare business with our guiding growth rate of over 46% year-over-year. The work we are doing in this vertical evaluation key shift towards consumerism where EPAM is building integrated experience in transactional platforms by bringing together critically important expertise we accumulated and working with more traditionally consumer oriented industries and now a strong subject matter knowledge impulse. Today for example, we are involved in truly ground breaking innovation work with companies that sit at the forefront of healthcare. We’ve helped them to translate the latest insights in innovations and genomics and digital information and mutual reality technologies into new business models for delivering healthcare and precision medicine targets to patients unique, genetic and phenotrophic profile. From a horizontal practise view, we continue our integration efforts of the recent acquisitions and we are increasing our investments into our key capabilities and digital strategy and user experience as well as data analytics and service design methodologies. We see a significant increase in customer traction or what we call our end-to-end engagement portfolio. So a continued investment in bringing together a very aggressive working between our traditional software and genetic services and those new imaging capabilities is one of our primary focuses. In this past quarter, we have added 10 significant new accounts for which seven represent this new digital and analytics engagement models as well as started a number of new digital initiatives across our existing clients. And we believe that this strength will accelerate into the next quarters. From a deliberation [ph] standpoint, our investment in key locations and in turn key iteration platform that allow us to work, identity and distant our talent pool are allowing us to do a better job and stack a new hybrid teams of consultants, designers, architects and engineers. In Q3, our global headcount increased to 14,000 employees. We continue to expand our footprint practically across all our main delivery, geographies including North America, Western as well as Central and Eastern Europe and also in Asia and now in Latin America. While competition for technology talent is very strong globally and represent a significant challenge to all players. Our ability to identify and track qualitative as well as quantitative methods will sophisticate an internal platforms give us an advantage in being able to hire retain [ph] and retain the best talent in the novel key global locations. Therefore [ph] results -- those efforts we continue to build on our reputation as a leader in product and platform development sales. With that, I will turn to Anthony to share more details on our performance and guidance.
Anthony Conte: Thank you, Ark and good morning everyone. I will spend a few minutes taking you through the third quarter results; then I will talk more about our outlook for the full year. As usual, you can find the full details of our results in our press release and on the quarterly fact sheet located in the Investors section of our website. Q3 was another solid quarter of revenue, closing at $236 million, and 22.5% over last year, 8.4% over prior quarter. As Ark mentioned, currency remains a big piece of our story as headwinds have continued compressing our Q3 revenue by about 8%, meaning in constant currency terms we would have grown 30.8% over Q3 2014 and 10.8/% sequentially. North America remains our largest geography representing 52.9% of our Q3 revenues, up 27.7% year-over-year and 31.3% in constant currency. The continued weakening of the Canadian dollar is a primary driver to the almost 4% currency headwind. Europe was up 26.3% year-over-year representing 38.7% of Q3 revenue. In constant currency terms EU would have been up 34.3% year-over-year reflecting the impact of both the euro and sterling volatility over the past year. For APAC, this is the first full quarter of 2015 that is comparable to prior year given the Q2, 2014 acquisition of Jointech. With that we saw 19.7% growth year-over-year and 23.1% in constant currency. We continue to see acceptance of our APAC offering as more non-banking and financial services customers move into that region. CIS continues to struggle and is down 27.7% year-over-year and down to only 4.6% of revenue in Q3. In constant currency terms the region would have seen 15.1% growth, clearly highlighting the dramatic drop in the rouble over the past year. Clearly even the 15% constant currency growth rate is well below our other regions, further reflecting the pressure on the business from a macro economic situation in CIS. In terms of our industry verticals, growth in banking and financial service this quarter remained consistent with Q2 at 10.7% year-over-year growth and 4.6% sequentially. The significant slowdown in the Russian banking industry compounded by the drop in the rouble is still offsetting the healthy growth in key banking and financial services accounts in other regions. In constant currency, banking and financial services grew 20% year-over-year and if you exclude CIS it would have grown 23%. Travel and consumer, turned in another strong quarter growing 36.9% year-over-year and 13.7% sequentially. In constant currency terms we saw 51.6% year-over-year with about 3% of this coming from navigation arts, who brought some strong logos into this vertical whom we acquired. Life sciences in healthcare grew 46.6% year-over-year with Q3 being the first fully comparable quarter since we acquired GDA [ph] in June of 2014. Sequentially, it grew 27.1% and now represents 8.4% of Q3 revenue. Currency has some minor impact here shifting the year-over-year growth rate to 49%. Business information and media has a solid quarter with 34.2% year-over-year growth and 9.9% sequentially. Currency on this vertical is immaterial as most customers are U.S. dollar denominated. The ISV vertical saw a drop in year-over-year growth rate and in the quarter at 15.9% growth and about 3% sequentially. Currency headwinds would add about 4% year-over-year and a key factor impacting this vertical is the work at [Indiscernible] ended in Q2 of 2015 due to the acquisition by Cognizant and excluding this account from all periods year-over-year growth for the balance of the vertical would have been 24.4%. Our other vertical which is our collection of customers from various industries grew 4% year-over-year and is down 3% sequentially. In our customer concentration numbers we are seeing some positive trends, our top 20 accounts which grew 19.2% year-over-year and 22.7% in constant currency now represent 53.9% of our Q3 revenue which is down about 2% from last quarter. Our other clients outside of our top 20% grew 26.8% year-over-year and 40.3% in constant currency. Turning to our expenses. We completed the quarter with over 14,000 IT professionals, an increase of about 22% compared to Q3 of 2014 and 18% increase year-to-date. Currency generated some benefits to the cost of revenue in the quarter when compared to prior year. There was about 6% constant currency benefit versus Q3 2014 and the allocation of our currencies across our expense base remains fairly consistent. Utilization for the quarter was at 75%, slightly down from Q2 due to the heavy July and August vacation season. GAAP income from operations increased 27.2% year-over-year to represent 11.8% of revenue in the quarter. GAAP IFO includes stock-based compensation expense and certain acquisition related costs that we exclude from our non-GAAP measures. Stock-based compensation expense for the third quarter increased 61% over prior year. This is mainly driven by the over 80% increase in our average closing stock price and additionally 38% of the total Q3 charge and 43% of this increase is related to acquisitions. Our non-GAAP income from operations for the quarter after all adjustments increased 30.5% over prior year to $41.5 million, representing 17.6% of revenue. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 20.2%, and for the quarter, we generated $0.70 of non-GAAP EPS $0.02 above our end -- top end of our guidance and $0.44 of GAPP EPS based on approximately 52 million shares diluted outstanding. Our balance sheet remained strong. We finished the quarter with approximately $214 million of cash plus $30 million in time deposit accounts. During the third quarter, operating activities generated approximately $55.5 million of cash. Unbilled revenue were at $105 million in September 30th. Accounts receivable were at $126 million and DSO ended the quarter at approximately 51 days. With that I'll now turn to our guidance. Due to the strong volatility in the currency markets which we believe will continue into 2016, we are adjusting how we provide guidance. So for the full year, we expect to achieve revenue growth of atleast 30% in constant currency and atleast $900 million in GAAP reported revenue. Non-GAAP net income growth for 2015 is expected to be atleast 25% year-over-year with an effective tax rate of approximately 20%. Full year non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be at least $2.65 per share based on the weighted average share count of approximately $52 million diluted shares outstanding. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be at least $1.55 per share. In February, we will provide you full year guidance for 2016 and then provide updates quarterly. With that, I'll now like to turn the call back over to the operator and open up for Q&A. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Please go ahead.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hi, Ark, hi, Anthony. So, if I understand this correctly, I'm kind of laying out three factors here. One is currency in CIS and Canada. The second is CIS revenue weakness, which have been there for a while. And the third is Trizetto moving out, but that sort of stuff is kind of normal ebb and flow of contracts that can happen. Is that sort of the sum total of all the impact or am I missing something with regards to the miss and I don't miss everyone according to guide down, because the lower end of the range seem to move up a little bit. Is that what the impacts are?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. All of these factors clearly play through all, but I don't think it's exactly a right analysis. I think on FX, definitely – FX definitely plays a major role. As we mentioned it was $2.7 million impact. And clearly, specifically Canadian dollars were the most biggest surprise for us. It's happened practically after our last announcements and we didn't expect at this level, so, Canadian dollars were low increase FX loss versus previous sequential quarter by $1.5 million. So, in general again, $2.7 million came from FX. Another $1.3 million, $1.5 million against what we were expecting is our guidance, came practically from reviewing and then making some decisions about how to proceed these capabilities which we required during the several last quarters. Because as we always mentioned, our acquisitions were mostly focusing on additional capabilities which would utilize the gross different EPAM units, and this quarter we have to make couple of calls where we have to decide about advantages of longer term perspective figures of short term revenue, and how to utilize capabilities which we get for potentially bigger deals from the future versus small short-term available possessions. So, that was actually another $1.3 million, $1.5 million. Trizetto was expected – mostly expected. We thought might be – would be little bit longer, but it was finished, but we didn't count on this much. And as you mentioned shares also more or less with what you understand how it’s what’s happening there?
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay. So…
Arkadiy Dobkin: So and if you take out for example $2.7 million than this is $1.3 million which is on kind of short-term revenue which we decided to give up, its couple of percent of mix.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Right, right. No. And that kind of gets us to where I think consensus was. As you look at that process of calling contracts and making that long-term versus short-term decision, is that process behind us? I know that as you grow it can come up again, but for now is it behind us and what is the forward looking impact?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think its still – yes, I understand. So I think its still could be partially drew in Q4.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay.
Arkadiy Dobkin: But after this we should start realizing the benefits of what we're doing. And we'll see.
Anthony Conte: But that's built into our guidance.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Right. That's right.
Anthony Conte: For Q3.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Right. And when you talk about the benefits, the forward benefit of walking away from shorter term revenues; is that mainly a resourcing type issue where you move resources towards getting longer work is it…
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. That's the right word. Yes. This is like, again, we're talking about here resource constraint, but we clearly were optimizing the long-term of opportunities with high quality -- capabilities otherwise it would short-term billable practice.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay. And my last question. Does any of this change, your forward view with regards to the nature of investments you're making as you go through that process whether on organic or inorganic basis?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Do you mean longer term projections or what?
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Yes. Not necessarily projections, but more investments that you're making as you think through what you – you gone through obviously a process here where you're kind of looking at, yes, that I want to be focus not in these other areas. Does that impact your investment process with regards to how you think of acquisitions, with regards to how you think of inorganic investments?
Arkadiy Dobkin: No. We don't think that it's impacting us. So, again, we said it before our approach to M&As and we were talking about multiple purposes, multiple growth of this including capabilities, specific expertise and probably some additional delivery locations, but its all still in place right now. So, we're not changing this approach and I don't think we – thinking that anything changed in the longer term perspective as well.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jason Kupferberg: Thanks, guys. Good morning. So, if current spot rate holds through all of next year what would be the OpEx headwinds on the top line in 2016?
Anthony Conte: I'm sorry, headwinds on 2016.
Jason Kupferberg: If current spot rate stay in effect through all of next year what would be the FX headwind on revenue in 2016?
Anthony Conte: I mean, we haven't really released our forecast for 2016, so I don't know that I could really compute for you what the headwinds would be. I mean, we'll factor that into our guidance when we give it. So, you're saying as compared to this year I guess is what you're saying?
Jason Kupferberg: Yes. Yes, just year-over-year, in other words, if we stay at these types of levels?
Anthony Conte: Honestly, I haven't done that calculation to really determine that.
Arkadiy Dobkin: But I think might be it would be held for -- held for different, a little different time factor, I mean, answer to a little bit different question. So, for example if estimate how much revenue will loss based on the FX situation from the time when we gave guidance for the year than this number would be 17 million right now.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. That's helpful.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And another number which might help everybody as well, if we compared as a lot in effects versus last year than this number would 51 million.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. Understood. And so, just shifting gears to the competitive environment, can you give us sense these days, how often are you competing versus the multinationals, you know, Accenture, Capgemini etcetera versus the big Indian players versus some of the other regional players in the CIS area, I mean, has that makes changed at all?
Arkadiy Dobkin: This is already pretty diverse competitive landscape for us. We are seeing all of those companies. So, we're seeing all of these companies on our competition list. And it might be a little bit different between different verticals, but it is pretty much everybody from you named.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. And can you give us a sense today of how penetrated the Fortune 1000 by EPAM in other words, what percentage of the Fortune 1000 roughly, if U.S. met our clients of EPAM today?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don't have. This one is not on the top my head, so probably we can't give this answer to you separately. So…
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. All right. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. The question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Darrin Peller: Hey, thanks guys. Look, I just to start off, I know it’s a little early, but with regard to outlook in terms of what you're seeing from your clients right now, any indications into 2016 in terms of trends and budgets and really how clients are feeling right now, may that would helpful, especially just given the some of settlement we're seeing out of some of your areas in Russia and another areas around there. It would be helpful to get a better sense of how everyone else is feeling for now?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I probably can repeat what I repeating during the quarters, quarter after quarter. So I think from our perspective, from our side we're seeing pretty healthy demand in North America and Western Europe. So, clearly, Russia or CIS is a different story. So from this perspective we'll see in the next year in similar terms like previous years. So that's our long term answer was like we're looking forward to grow at least 20%.
Darrin Peller: Okay. What about with some of your top clients. I mean, I guess, it's been pretty big driver for you seeing is specifically UBS. I'm carrying a fair amount of growth for you guys over the past years. I mean, I think it was about 22% or low 20s% this quarter as what we calculate, little bit of deceleration although, it's obviously offered very high growth rate before and maybe FX impact you that as well. Maybe just give us little more color on the top few clients when we get it there?
Anthony Conte: As far as UBS growth, the one thing I do want to point out, remember that we acquired Jointech in Q2 of last year. So that brought us a significant uptake in UBS revenue since they were primarily servicing on the UBS. So the growth rate in UBS has to be adjusted for the fact that this is in the first fully comparable quarter for 2015. So it was a 20 – you're right, its about 21% growth rate for UBS this quarter. Constant currency would be about 25% for UBS. I think it's – the growth there remains solid and strong. The growth rate is obviously down from where it was in Q1, Q2 because of the Jointech acquisition but its growing pretty much inline with where we expected to be and in line with the rest of the company.
Darrin Peller: Okay. Anything for the other Top 5 guys that you can just comment on any risk or opportunities that we should be aware of given how there are some pretty large clients out there?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Well, UBS we spoke about, you mean, from the top 10 or 20 or…
Darrin Peller: Yes. You can go as far as Top 10 perhaps. I mean, I was really thinking just given there some concentration of the Top 5 or so, but yes, I mean, Top 10 is great?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, I can tell you that Top 5 in general grew about 20%. And I think that's like Top 10 grow in 25%. So this is all in line with general growth.
Anthony Conte: And going through the list and there's nothing – there is no specific big stories in any of them, the stories there, pretty consistent with what we've always talked about, it just continue to gain traction and penetrate deeper into those clients.
Darrin Peller: Okay. Just last question for you guys.
Anthony Conte: There is special story.
Darrin Peller: I appreciate that. Just last question from me.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And just to also call it like last year Trizetto was one of the Top 10 clients for us.
Darrin Peller: All right. That's a fair point. Thanks. Just last question again on the margin side, again, you've maintain margins in a certain band and you've done a pretty job with that and reinvesting in the business. Just give us a little comfort level on cushion you have to continue to reinvest and what's need it given, just how competitive digital has become across your -- pretty much top few names out there, really a pull ahead of the pack around digital and you guys have done a probably standout job given how percentage your mix is digital. But again it's always a challenge to know what you invested in and the margin is a story for you guys even able to maintain. So, is there – is that – are you still comfortable with that capability going forward whether it’s a next quarter or even year given just how competitive digital is becoming?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. We are comfortable and we clearly going to continue to compete in this place very seriously. And we do believe that we have very interesting distinguish against most our players in this space, because we're really trying to invest in integration between digital part of this and really strong [Indiscernible] and we do think that is becoming pretty obviously competitive advantage for us and differentiator. So, from this point of view we're not trying to replicate some other companies each to go into this kind of overlap of digital agencies all around the globe. We're trying to bring this capability and actually really deeply integrate with our delivery skills.
Darrin Peller: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Mayank Tandon of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Elizabeth Chwalk: Hi. This is Elizabeth Chwalk for Mayank. Thank you for taking my questions. Are there been any changes in hiring or hiring plans in your key delivery locations?
Arkadiy Dobkin: As I mentioned today we do hiring people across all locations, mostly during the last 18 months we expanded in central Eastern Europe like we open as you know Bulgaria, we're growing in Poland. We open center in Czech Republic, so we mentioned that we building operating in Mexican [Indiscernible] already brought their existing clients. So we're looking at this as very much kind of global perspective how to serve clients from different locations and potentially 24x7.
Elizabeth Chwalk: Okay. Thank you. And can you give us any color on how attrition is trending and how wage inflation or deflation what that looks like given the recent currency issues?
Anthony Conte: Attrition remains pretty low for us. For the quarter we saw about 8.2% of voluntary production attrition, so it's much lower than our historical average which usually in the low teens. Again as we've talked about in past quarters this kind of driven by the situation in the CIS region allowing us to keep attrition down, so we don't know if that’s going to be a long term permanent effect or not at this stage but we're taking it for this year. As far as wage inflation goes, we would do a small mid-year promotion cycle. So, we saw about 2.5%, 2.6% of wage inflation coming from that mid year cycle, otherwise for the year it remains very low close to zero because of the benefits of FX.
Elizabeth Chwalk: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Peter Christiansen of UBS. Please go ahead.
Peter Christiansen: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Ark, I look back, I think about like two years ago, you had Thomson Reuters rolling off and that time the company was intentionally lowering utilization, investing in the pipeline of work that you saw coming in. Now today, if Trizetto rolling off, you talked about some new accounts coming into the pipeline with important key digital initiatives and utilizations now in the mid 70s. Can we draw parallels between these two periods? Am I thinking about this correctly that you are kind of saving your power there for longer term potential here?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thomson Reuters was the largest client versus Trizetto was one of the Top 10, I don't see this is direct here. Also we're talking about Trizetto because it’s a very kind of probably within formation when Cognizant acquired them, but during the history, during the three years we have similar situation like we were standard because of acquisitions, because of some other different reasons one client from top to any each year Thomson [Indiscernible].  So, I wouldn't put strong parallels. At the same time, yes, Trizetto was big enough clients and we clearly had our opportunities to the purpose, the talent in different directions. So, no, I don't its direct parallels [ph] business. By the way at the same time I would mention that from three years ago Thomson Reuters now become again Top 5 clients.
Peter Christiansen: Okay. Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: And probably this is in three years ago.
Peter Christiansen: Okay. And then, I think we've heard a little bit during the quarter about potentially some areas that you're looking to in Blockchain, is this is a key capability that you're looking to build upon and do you see this a big opportunity for the company?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don't think we were talking about Blockchain on our calls, but in general yes, it could be interesting opportunities including we're looking at into this, which is relatively only one, but as we all know very important financial markets right now.
Peter Christiansen: Great. And then, Anthony, can you give us a breakdown of the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP for the full year, I guess, giving that full year?
Anthony Conte: Sure.
Peter Christiansen: Or for the quarter would have bit easier?
Anthony Conte: I can do either or both.
Peter Christiansen: For the quarters it would be great.
Anthony Conte: Yes, stock comp obviously the biggest component for the quarter. It was just under $12 million for the full year. It will about $45 million. M&A activity will be about $500,000 for the year, for the quarters about $427, amortization and purchase intangibles was $1.3 million for the quarter, it would be about $5 million for the year. And FX right was about 150 negative for the quarter. It will be about $6 million positive for the year and I think that's it. That should get you everything.
Peter Christiansen: Great. And then the stock based comp that was tied to M&A, is that size of that, is that recurring, do you believe that level or was that more one time in nature?
Anthony Conte: No. its not one time, it will continue through probably a little bit into next year about half way as we start fall off, so next year we'll start to see some fall up in lets say 2012 acquisition, some of the amortization than it will kind of fall off from there as acquisition age.
Peter Christiansen: Right. Thanks for taking my question.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Arvind Ramnani of Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.
Arvind Ramnani: Hi, Ark, hi Anthony. I think that we as far as to talk about some of your large like $20 million accounts clearly a search in all of these accounts, but what are some of the inflexion points at a client that will help the account grow from like $4, $5 million account to $20 million. And what are you doing from a process perspective to enable more of the accounts to get this $20 million plus mark?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. We don't have kind of these accounts at $20 million mark here. I think its still pretty individual improvisation happening. Yes. We have probably around six, seven accounts right now. So, and I think that what we exactly trying to do and that's what we were doing during these last three years, bringing this most strategic capabilities to the clients being able to start more consultative engagements, people who can handle these type of conversations and advice. And we're usually building very strong reputation as a delivery partner. After each client coming to us and starting to – who are coming to us and started to ask about more strategic capabilities and kind of advice and bring installment together and that's why we were really lack in talent like three, four years ago. And again, that's what we were doing and that's what we trying to do. And I think increasing large clients is actually showing that it works and that we continue to do -- planning to continue to do.
Arvind Ramnani: Great. Helpful. And just very quick on Russia, as expected that the business continues to get kind of smaller, so what's the thinking, what kind of keeping the Russia business still ongoing, is that some point probably it’s a little too expensive to kind of maintain that business or is that thinking of keeping the Russia business still ongoing so that's an environment gets smoke and conducive to growth, you're dare to take advantage of the opportunity. This time we get a clear sense of your Russia starting longer term?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Basically if I rephrase, are you asking why we still stay in the market and why we not exiting market completely?
Arvind Ramnani: Yes.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it would be for us a little bit premature to do something like this. Russia and Former Soviet Union countries, its quarter million population which again, yes, we know that it's went down, but there are still major businesses there. There is still going on international business which consider in the region as a market and they need to be serve there. And for us is our routes would be kind of a little bit silly probably exiting the market where we can comfortably accurate and still going to accurate because we have 2000 delivery capacity in the market. So we're going to stay there no matter what from delivery perspective. So we just need to be more careful what we're doing, how we're doing this – what type of clients to serve and that's already happening during the last three years, because even before ruble crash you probably saw that the proportionally shares market was going down.
Arvind Ramnani: Yes. That's very helpful. Thank you very much and good luck for the rest of the year.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Alex Veytsman of Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Please go ahead.
Alex Veytsman: Yes. Good morning, guys. Quick question for you on North America, it seems that sequential revenue grew roughly $15 million which is arguably one of the largest deltas we've seen in a region for the last several quarters. Could you be more specific about what drove that in terms of accounts and also your verticals?
Arkadiy Dobkin: You said sequential you saw a growth that was progressing.
Alex Veytsman: From Q2 to Q3, right, from Q2 to Q3.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Right. So it’s up about -- on reported terms North America is up about 14 million due to – I don't know that we address any specific accounts within that. North America just continues to be a very strong, our strongest sector. Growth is coming really from across the spectrum of different verticals, so they are really growing. I don't know if there's any specific story different than I kind of spoke to at the top level. Obviously, travel and consumer was very big for us this quarter globally, that's still also true within North America. And we saw a growth across many of our other verticals. So, there's no specific story that I have that addresses that.
Alex Veytsman: And as far as going forward…
Arkadiy Dobkin: It's really profitable perspective.
Alex Veytsman: And as far as going forward for the fourth quarter, should we expect you know you dealt it to be fairly similar or do you expect it to be more in line with Q3, because it was I mean….
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, Alex it was actually coupled kind of fixed cost deliverables which we did we did in North America which probably was a little bit extra. So I think life science contributed well in this segment. So probably next quarters maybe not for North America as strong as this one but in general its going to consistently grow like it did in the past.
Alex Veytsman: [Indiscernible] that’s helpful. And then for life sciences, I mean like as you mention yes, it was quite significant growth obviously Silicon of a growth with smaller segments so it grows fairly fast, what are your expectations for the next several quarters. Are you expecting it to kind of harbour around the same levels that you -- or do you expect to expand?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So probably in the future it would be getting more in line with average across the company. So and right now it’s too early to say. So I think it still will be growing in Q4 pretty too well and let’s see.
Alex Veytsman: Sounds good. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Please go ahead.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Hi, I just wanted to follow back up on one question. You know when you move to using atleast --it’s a good move but clearly positive and negatives to providing only a lower bound instead of a range. So I just want to understand for 4Q what you guys assumptions are with regards to budget flush, with regards to FX, demand trend it seems like FX would stay consistent and the demand trend generally speaking is good except for the calling you mentioned so that sort of leaves primary the budget flush. What are your assumptions generally for 4Q?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think everybody has too memory, because this spike in Q4 was happening like more like in 2013 I think. So it was smaller last year and we don’t expect much this year. So it would probably would be kind of regular quarterly increase as anybody else. Because like in 2016 it was probably imparted by actually CIS market where it had more fixed cost deals closing in Q4. So last year it was already different and this year we don’t expect it.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay, that…
Anthony Conte: And then to your question on -- and the answer to your question on FX expectations, built into the forecast is really looking at some of the forward rates for the quarter and you know taking that approach for what we build in from FX expectations. So it will be dependent upon how good the forward forecasts are.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Super. That’s good to know, great. Thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from Anil Doradla of William Blair. Please go ahead.
Maggie Nolan: Hi, this is Maggie Nolan in for Anil Doradla. I had a question on I know you spoke some about your tap [ph] talents but I’m wondering if the focus in the long term is going to be more on growing kind of this existing tap [ph] talents and finding new opportunities within those accounts or if you are looking more towards really growing the client base overall. Hoping you can shed a little bit more color on that?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, probably my answer would be very simple that we are trying to do both, but we have really and we do believe that we have a very strong opportunity in our existing base and we will be continuing growing this and finding new lines of revenue there especially taking into account that we are spending our capabilities and can venture [ph] new things. So I think existing accounts is a big potential for us, we have pretty large number of -- I don’t know exactly what percent of Fortune 500 of 1000 but we have a significant number of large clients which could grow in double and [Indiscernible] with us. But we also when -- a very strong potential right now on the new logo.
Maggie Nolan: Great. That helps thanks. Because we have heard some of your peers mention you know trying to kind of zone [ph] in on some of those existing accounts a little bit more, so I’m wondering is there a tab for the number of new opportunities that you want to bring on or do you just intend to continue to grow headcounts just for that growth?
Arkadiy Dobkin: What we do believe that we need to have pretty [Indiscernible] client base and not to have to concentrate it. So I think what we have today and with our potential growth of around 20% plus we will try to maintain similar client concentration.
Maggie Nolan: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question.
Operator: Thank you. At this time I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dobkin for any closing comments.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Again thank you everyone to join in today and I hope we have addressed concerns which we understand were valid and I hope, we hope to see you in three months again. Thank you. Bye.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the EPAM Systems Second Quarter 2015 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Lilya Chernova, IR. Thank you, you may begin.
Lilya Chernova: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company’s second quarter 2015 results. If you have not, a copy is available in the Investor Relations section on our website at epam.com. The speakers on today’s call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Anthony Conte, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today’s call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company’s earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Arkadiy?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Lilya. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. Today, we’re reporting another strong quarter with 25% revenue growth over last year and 33% growth in constant currency tax. Our Q2 revenue is $280 million above both consensus and guidance and represents sequential growth of 9% against Q1. Anthony will provide more detail update on our financial performance in second quarter as well as explain the changes in our Q3 in 2015 guidance. Before that I am going to first on business highlights and our operations in priorities. As you know, we are well into 2015 plan at this point. We also know what in our previous conversions that our strategies and plans were are set out some time ago in an attempt to realizing opportunities open up for service providers due to the strong digital disruption in the traditional marketplaces. Today there is a significant number of corporate wide information programs that many large and smaller companies are undertaking as a first priority. We also convenience now that these disruptions presented a very specific opportunity for EPAM through advance in the market so called product development services space. We talk previously in some level of debts about it. So during the last quarter, we continue to move forward in line with our plans. Also, if you remember at the begin of the year, we mentioned that we wanted to bring our new brand to life and present more consistent messaging around our growth service working in our target industries. As planned in the beginning of June, we launched our new website and now we consider the current state of it still work in progress and I think it always will be taken in account how fast all change in technology. We believe it's now better communicates our intent and direction. During the last couple of years we invested significantly both organically and via strategic acquisitions to develop strong digital capabilities within EPAM. We view this as a holistic mindset across all of the EPAM [indiscernible] not just enhance our standalone unit. We plan to continually invest into such capabilities and focus on growing new type of that [indiscernible] utilize in decisive thinking and services and methods to grab new business opportunities for our clients and new types of engagement for us. In addition, in last month we increased our North American footprint related depths and digital space with an additional Arch acquisition. While on this static I would like to mention that this acquisition strengthen also our capabilities in web content technologies specifically with the expertise in such recent platform at Sitecore and Sitecore was just this month recognized by Gartner together with their ability as a two absolutely just in web content management platforms. It also brings to EPAM several interest in clients including regional dynamics Medicare just to mention a few. But we are not starting to address digital area. We agree that some region industry expert that the real key in the capturing the digital shift is crucial to this types of programs into the very close integration of these enterprise platforms. This is exactly how we see the next very important in horizontal that we call Intelligent Enterprise. It is a real connective tissue that brings digital content information into the business at large, for us this is about building on core strength in XLVI and Big data, while expanding into data science and analytical areas. It also provides the ability to integrate all of that with traditional ERP sharing platforms and in many cases to help move all that to the cloud and finally to our assistant managing those applications in cloud infrastructure itself, or take a full ownership in particular cases of those tasks. All that is impossible without very deep advanced skill set and strong hands on understanding of the next generation technology platforms enterprise and related end tiers of accumulated enterprise level R&D engagement  This is what our next advanced technology service line is working. From expertise in the next generation technologies to the more than constantly changing delivery practices and through our internal client oriented innovation lapse to test and to prototype new ideas and to research effectiveness and applicability for example, cloud sourcing through 0:06:19.2 [indiscernible] approaches to help solving various strategic client programs. Two decades of experience, sharing total global technology companies and being an extension of their R&D units for years puts EPAM into new position of working in a very different type of services to our demanding client. We suddenly become exposed to the very pressure and digital disruptions. And when our expertise in the advanced technology combines with our much [indiscernible] 0:06:48.6 in intelligent enterprise and digital engagements, we believe it is a very new preposition to the market. But we don’t stop there too. As you all know EPAM has always put great emphasis on software engineering excellence. That was actually our primary deadline for a very long time. That focus allow us to attract top portfolio for the companies in technology power houses of the world to utilize our engineering services, and then in turn helped us to develop our advanced technology understanding and capabilities at a very different level. And then another turn to support our intelligent enterprise and digital engagement service lines to the full extent. Therefore we continue to invest in and to develop the very core engineering competency. We do it through very structured talent acquisition created, very specific training in our harmonized talent retention programs including our regular software engineering conferences, local and global hacthones, specialty awards and other internal development programs. Without this core engineering skills, and I think we talked about it before, could be delivering for those new types of solutions, our clients expect from us today. This core engineering service line really forms the foundation for much of the work we provide to customers in all our other service lines. In addition we also continue to see good amount of the business in our traditional independent software vendor segment which is still very strategic for us and allow us to stay in good shape and be much better, and much fully prepared for the new engineering and technology shifts which are constant today. So in overall the key challenges and investments which we face are how to combine those type of traditionally the very different service lines in the most effective way and make those work together from start to finish, to serve our client problems not just from conceptual standpoint, but from final delivery implementation and production standpoint. Now from vertical point of view. We are seen really interesting conversions in demand for vertical demand expertise together this new technology and service capabilities I mentioned today. They show strong traction this past quarter result relevant in retail business. I am optimistic about the growth in life science and healthcare vertical. It’s also very much in line with what happen in financial services and media and entertainment segment as well. From geographical standpoint; we continue to expand in large part but following our customer engagement expansions plans in Asia and Europe and also with have a new presence in Mexico. Asia is becoming more diversified in terms of verticals providing support in core engineering task and in also digital to some new customers and the retail medium consumer verticals. So that is high level of our go-to-market approach and that is mostly what we were focusing on and we’ll continue to focus. Along with our investments and business development in the current management practices reach a change and to support new requirement from the service lines we described. And clearly, very serious investments in market and branding efforts and programs  Finally, I wanted to share a few examples of the types of new engagements that we are seeing, that I hope really look straight at the type of services we can provide now. So one good example of our designs and leadership driving real product development service is the work we started with the Vodafone and there are new products in Strap data from motor scooters. We started with our new services and had been providing conceptual design and working with the customer. We took it from initial concept to drew new item to industrial design, to application design and to final development. We’re seeing these type of design led engagements are a real opportunity for us to capture more in the market share in this product development segment. On the technical product development side, we said become a product development partner for Unify, who has a new product build in generation cloud based collaboration platform to enterprises. Well design is a big component of the engagement and where we successfully competed to start global design fronts. There is a real depth of technology capability that is required to build the project that should differentiate the sales against very serious global competition. It's included in project companies like Unify see us a strategic partner to help them develop in such fronts.  Finally we are seeing how our existing customers is whom you have longstanding relationship like Adidas for example, push into new service model for such platforms like marketing technology and utilizing capacity agile for delivery. This is a potentially really interesting for us because it confronts our differentiation capabilities and our advantage in delivering this type of new service model to expand from traditional IT services to digital marketing area, but very tightly relying on strong conversion technology and core engineering capabilities. This is what exactly differentiates us in this product development services space.  With that I will turn to Anthony to share more details on our performance and guidance.
Anthony Conte: Thank you, Ark and good morning everyone. I will spend a few minutes taking you through the second quarter results; then I will talk more about our outlook for Q3 and the full year. As usual you can find the full details of our results in our press release and on the quarterly fact sheet located in the Investors section of our Web site. Q2 was another solid quarter of revenue, closing at 217. 8 million, and 24.7% over last year, 8.9% over prior quarter, and beating both consensus and guidance. Currency headwinds remained compressing our Q2 revenue by about 8%, meaning in constant currency terms we would have grown 32.5% over Q2 2014. Sequentially, we are up 8.9% from Q1 and 6.7% in constant currency terms; meaning, compared to Q1 we saw some currency tailwinds on our revenue. The key currency mix of our revenue in Q2 has remained relatively consistent with what I shared in Q1. North America remains our largest segment representing 50.7% of our Q2 revenues, up 27.6% year-over-year and 30.4% in constant currency, the difference being mainly movements from the Canadian dollar. Europe was up 27.5% year-over-year representing 40.1% in Q2 revenue. In constant currency terms EU would have been up 37.4% year-over-year. APac continues to grow and diversify away from just banking and financial services, now representing 2.8% of revenue and growing 14.9% sequentially. CIS continues to struggle and is down 20.9% year-over-year representing only 5.4% of revenue in Q2. The dynamic of this drop in both currency and volume related. But in constant currency terms, CIS would have been up 8.5% year-over-year. In terms of our industry verticals we have seen some tempering of the growth in the banking and financial service industry this quarter, at about 10.7% growth rate, due to significant slowdown in the Russian banking customers, offsetting the healthy growth in the banking sector we are seeing in other regions. We are seeing some encouraging expansion with the travel and consumer space, especially in Europe, growing 42.3% year-over-year and 18% versus prior quarter. The upswing represents account growth across the board and specifically increased traction in the EU market. Life sciences and healthcare, our newest vertical grew 8% sequentially, business information and media and ISV, both demonstrated continued strength generating over 20% year-over-year growth.  Our other vertical which is a collection of customers from barriers industries is down 6% year-over-year, due primarily to the Russian ruble decline, but is up 6% sequentially. We are seeing some positive trends with our customer concentration numbers. Our top 20 accounts grew 22.3% year-over-year now represents 55.3% which is down 1% from last year in concentration field. All other clients outside our top 20 grew 27.5% year-over-year. Now, turning to our expenses. We completed the quarter with over 13,200 IT professionals, an increase of about 20% compared to Q2 of 2014 and 10.8% increase year-to-date. Currency continued to generate some benefits to our cost of revenue in the quarter when compared to prior year. There was approximately 8% constant currency benefit versus Q2 of 2014 and the allocation of our currencies across our expense base also remains fairly consistent with what I shared in Q1. Utilization for the quarter was up 76%, slightly down but still in our target range.  GAAP income from operations increased 27.8% year-over-year to represent 10.8% of our revenue in the quarter. GAAP IFO includes stock-based compensation expense and certain other acquisition related costs that we exclude from our non-GAAP measures. Stock-based compensation for the second quarter increased 108% over prior year. This is mainly driven by being 60% plus increase in our stock price and 40% of the total Q2 charge and 55% of this increase is related to the acquisitions that we made in 2014. Our non-GAAP income from operations for the quarter after these adjustments, increased 27.7% over prior year to $36.9 million, representing 16.9% of revenue. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was up closing at 21.3%. Overall, the tax rate is increasing due to subtle changes in our organic geographic mix of current year earnings, shifting towards countries with higher statutory rates. Additionally, new tax jurisdictions or deeper concentration into some existing jurisdictions from the acquired businesses in 2014 and area such U.S., Western Europe and Asia also added to the increasing tax rate. For the quarter, we generated $0.64 of done GAAP EPS at the top end of our guidance and $0.37 of GAAP EPS based on approximately 52 million shares diluted outstanding. Our balance sheet remained strong. We finished the quarter with approximately 205 million of cash. During the second quarter, operating activities generated approximately 2.2 million of cash. Unbilled revenue was at 92 million as of June 30th. Accounts receivable was that 135 million and DSO ended the quarter at approximately 51 days. With that I'll now turn to our guidance. We are increasing our full year 2015 revenue growth expectations to 23% to 25%, non-GAAP net income growth for 2014 is now expected to be in the range of 22% to 24%, and our effective tax rate will be approximately 21%. For the third quarter of 2015, EPAM expects revenues between 238 million and 240 million representing a growth rate of 23% to 25% over the third quarter of 2014. Third quarter of 2015 non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.66 to $0.68 based on the estimated third quarter 2015 weighted average share count of 52 million shares. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of$0.43 to $0.45.  With that I would now like to turn the call back over to the operator and open up for Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Anil Doradla from William Blair. Mr. Doradla? We will move on to our new questioner. Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies.
Amit Singh: It's great that you guys raised the overall reported guidance just wanted to get a sense of that in second quarter it seems like the FX headwinds were slightly lower than what you guys were expecting around 70 basis points lower, and for the full year you guys have previously talked a 6% year-over-year FX headwind. I’m trying to get a sense of has that expectation change as well, I mean ultimately I’m trying to get your constant currency revenue growth guidance for the full year?
Anthony Conte: Yes, hi, the expectation for the full year has not changed. We saw some pull back in currency in Q2, but if you look at what happened really over the past month, it looks like the Ruble is starting to fall again. We’re seeing some weakness in Hungarian Forint, and the Pound in Europe as well. So I would say our expectations remained consistent with what we have given kind of 5% to 6% full year. The Q2 coming in slightly below our initial expectation, looks like it is reversing in Q3 at this point.
Amit Singh : And then for the guidance raise, if you could breakdown, I mean how much of it is from the second quarter upside versus the expected contribution from navigation arch. And while you are speaking about it, if you could give us a little bit of sense of how much inorganic contribution is supposed to be in your 2015 revenues. 
Anthony Conte: When you say inorganic, you're specifically talking at navigation arch or are you talking about comparatives to prior year?
Amit Singh: First to start-off in this year, your guidance raise, how much is it from the second quarter revenue upside, and from the expected contribution from navigation archs in your full year revenue?
Anthony Conte: It’s very hard to separate the two. With navigation archs, we've actually already begun a full integration and we have some plans where we are actually going to market as one company already, so the guidance actually includes a pretty well integrated go-to-market approach. So I can’t clearly separate the two, from what’s organic and what’s coming from navigation arch, just the way we did this acquisition. Roughly speaking I would say that if you look at the first half of the year and the over performance from the first half for the year combined with our expectations for the second half and including navigation arch you can roughly say 50-50 is organic and inorganic, but again that line is fairly blurred based on how we’re moving forward with integration and navigation archs and what we are seeing as probably traction with their existing accounts and the growth expectations we have.
Amit Singh : All right perfect and just one last one from me, for margins I mean you guys are showing year-over-year, adjusted operating margin improvement and this quarter it was up 40 basis points year-over-year. How much of that is related to FX and as you are talking about the full year, are you guys still expecting to be in that 16% to 18% range?
Anthony Conte: Yes, we are expecting to be in that range. And the impact on margins from FX is actually relatively small. We tend to be relatively in actual hedge. We see some real headwinds on revenue -- believe no other benefits on the expense side, so it's really negligible benefit at the operation margin level from currency.
Operator: Our next question is from Anil Doradla from William Blair.
Anil Doradla: Just a small clarification, skipped a little bit of your prepared remarks, but on the infrastructure service, I know it's a very small portion of your business, but what's going on there? I mean from a sequential and year-over-year, growth not very strong.
Anthony Conte: Nothing's really special. I would say that it is really not a significant piece of our business. It's not something that we actively go after or actively market. A lot of our infrastructure services is related to other services in the software development space that we are providing. So it's not something we are really focused on. It's relatively small piece of the overall revenue Pi. So it moves randomly within the 8% to 9% in that range there.
Anil Doradla: Right, and Arkadiy as a follow up, can you talk a little bit about talent, your ability to source talent and ability to get the right personnel, clearly you are moving in the right direction, you are hiring a lot of people. Can you at least qualitatively talk how the talent pool is? Many of your competitors are opening shops in some of the geographies that you are present in. So would love to hear what is going on at that front.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yeah. It would be good if you confirm who is opening so. I think we mostly in line is our regular core maintenance hearings so it's, I am repeating probably this each call that in general there is definitely shortage of talent and I mentioned today what we are doing in this area and how we are trying to not just hire from market, but grow people internally, but at the same time working with university. I wouldn’t say anything new happening this quarter and I wouldn’t say that there is some specific issue which we may consist doesn’t work like several quarters ago. It is one of the challenges and this challenge we kind of inflation for the -- probably for the decades and probably it will deflate some more so, don't see any changes.
Operator: Our next question is from Steven Milunovich from UBS.
Steven Milunovich: Good morning this is Peter in for Steve. Thanks for taking my question. Anthony could you give us a sense of what attrition was in the quarter?
Anthony Conte: Attrition came in at about 7.5% for the quarter, voluntary, yes.
Steven Milunovich: Voluntary, so that marks two quarters your 8% or below, is that changing your plans for headcount growth for the year at all?
Anthony Conte: We’re adjusting based on that and continue to watch attrition levels. As we said in Q1, we’re still benefiting from some of the macroeconomic issues that are going on in CIS region and that's helping keep attrition low. So we keep watching that. We do expect it to start to go back up to normal levels at some point, but we modulate our headcount in recruiting based on what we’re seeing for attrition trends.
Steven Milunovich: Okay. Any sense of what type of headcount growth you are looking for to exit the year end.
Anthony Conte: I’m sorry, can you repeat that question?
Steven Milunovich: What the expected headcount growth that you are expected to exit this year at?
Anthony Conte: It looks like we’re on target to roughly in the high-teens to 20%.
Steven Milunovich: And then if I look at SG&A, its up about 300 bips as a percentage of revenue year-over-year, same as last quarter, should we consider this roughly the new baseline. And if currencies were to reverse and go against you, how flexible are you in controlling that spending?
Anthony Conte: We can definitely control the spending, a part of the uptick that you are seeing is related to -- we’ve opened a number of new locations which brings new facilities, some new overheads, but not upfront investments to get those facilities up and running. So a lot of that, front runs, when those locations can become billable. So that's causing a spike in my SG&A. As far as currency goes, SG&A, a lot of that tends to be in US dollars. So we don't get a ton of benefit through the SG&A line from currency, most of that seems to impact our cost of revenue. And so that causes a little bit of the swing that you see in percentage of revenue. So we get benefit from cost of revenue which helps gross margin go up, but SG&A doesn’t get as much of a savings from currency.
Steven Milunovich: That make sense. And then if I look at revenue per engineer adjusting for currency, it looks to be up nicely about 6%, 7% year-over-year. Can you attribute that to more of a changing dynamic of the mix of work that you’re doing or our pricing uplift contributing to that as well?
Anthony Conte: Honestly, we don’t spend a lot of time looking at that particular metric revenue by headcount. It’s not something that we analyze, so I can’t answer that specifically. As the reason for the uptick, I think that we are seeing increases from a pricing perspective still. Unfortunately currency headwinds are taking a lot of the price increases away because we have a lot of ruble, pound, euro and euro based revenue. So we’re seeing some headwinds taking away some of that pricing benefit. And we are seeing ourselves continue to sell the higher value services and we’re moving more and more towards higher product development services and I don’t know, Ark, if you want to talk more about that mix of our services.
Arkadiy Dobkin : We’re not sharing specific data here, but clearly again back to what you said a little earlier today, we see it as a digital consultative approach in this area, actually create very different entry point for us and very interesting opportunities in the market across all these verticals were we work. So I know, again we said tolerative couple of examples, but there are many more and this example is not a kind of singled out case. It's actually differently a representation of some type of trends.
Steven Milunovich: Is this changing some of these uplifts that you’re seeing from this consultative approach? How would you compare that versus some of the earlier success you’ve had with MT labs and leveraging some of the front end capabilities of that acquisition?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Its extension and clearly we will get as more experience how it works. And as also we mentioned that one of the key challenges is kind of how to make this type of capabilities working in good harmony and how to work from the beginning together when we start to consult and design. There is a very good understanding in how we’re going to deliver. And like all the successes are actually opposite when we started to work together, people from 0:32:59.1 [indiscernible]. Now it’s coming on a very different level and very different size of programs as well. So again that's an experience which we have already for two plus years and then we added, as we also mentioned service design capabilities, use great 0:33:16.9 [indiscernible] acquisition and now we call that we would be able to do it much smoothly with the new additional skill set. 
Operator: Our next question is from Alexie Gogulus [ph] from JP Morgan. We’ll switch to Vladimir Bespalo from VTB Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Vladimir Bespalo: I have a question for both your verticals, so if you look at the growth rates they acquired diversion for example on banking and financial services. So we see a slowdown in some other verticals like travel and consumer and life sciences and healthcare; we see very good growth. So what is behind these, so this is the first question; and how to see these verticals going forward? , How big trends are going to develop, in particular in your guidance for the full year for example?
Anthony Conte: Well, on the banking and financial, I kind of addressed this in my script. The main issue in banking and financial is that the Russian Ruble dropped and the macroeconomic concerns in Russia have really impacted our banking and financial services clients there causing a significant pull back when we look at it as a percentage of our overall revenue, it actually dropped so much its offsetting all the positives that we’re seeing in Europe and North America and the traction we’re having there. As far as travel and consumer goes, again as I kind of referencing to my script, we are seeing, very broad based growth especially in Europe, and we are gaining significant traction in the travel consumer space and we saw some real heavy growth across the board in Europe and even in North America from the travel consumer sector.
Arkadiy Dobkin: But in general we expect as we also mentioned before, we expect growth and similar growth across all our verticals and there is clearly volatility, quarter-by-quarter depending on when new client start or some spikes in delivery or special -- kind of very special deliverables for specific programs. And again results size, sometimes it actually great this kind of difference in growth, in particular quarter. But there is nothing special to change it.
Operator: Our next question is from James Friedman from Susquehanna.
James Friedman: Anthony, I want to ask you about the pricing environment. I know that you had mentioned that some of the price actions may have gotten compromised by foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis through how would you characterize the direction in pricing?
Anthony Conte: Direction in pricing for the constant currency is roughly in range with what we have discussed. We are still seeing 6% to 8% annual price increases. So we are still seeing a pretty healthy relatively speaking pricing environment for our services. So very consistent with what we have discussed in the past.
James Friedman: Okay. And then with regards to the top 10 customers, I know you called it out, as seen here in fact sheet here, looks like you jump a bit year-over-year, was down sequentially. I guess my question is how far behind the top 10 is that revenue rushing in? So was this balanced across the remainder of the customer base or are there others that are up and coming that may enter the top desk style here?
Anthony Conte: Yes, it's definitely across the board. And I think I have shared one of metrics that talked about, I looked at it slightly at top 20 and below the top 20. But if you look at all of our customers below the top 20, they are growing at over 27%. So, pretty healthy growth coming from the broad customer base. So we are seeing a lot of growth across the board, a lot of new customers coming into the pipeline and significant growth outside of the top 10 and top 20.
Operator: Our next question is from Alex Veytsman from Monness, Crespi.
Alex Veytsman: Just want to talk to you about Europe. It looks like sequentially you had roughly 7 million to 8 million upside from the first quarter to the second quarter in the European market. What's specifically driving that upside, where are you seeing the strongest trends right now?
Anthony Conte: In Europe end markets specifically Alex, is that the question?
Alex Veytsman: Yes, specifically in Europe. Yes.
Anthony Conte: Well, as I mentioned the travel consumer was actually one of our strongest sectors in the European market for this quarter. Additionally banking and financial continues to be a very big market for us in Europe as well. Obviously UBS is based out of Europe and continues to grow strongly for us. We have a number of new banking customers, and we have a number of new travel customers and the consumer space. So those three areas tend to be the strongest growth for us in Q2 in European market.
Alex Veytsman: And then it looks like that CIS as a percentage of total revenues is stabilizing, actually increased for the first time in last several quarters. It's roughly 5% of total revenues, is that what you expect as a run rate for the rest of the year and maybe continue as well?
Anthony Conte: Yes, that’s approximately we’re expecting it to settle in at. The Q1 is typically very slow quarter for CIS. There is just you have half of January with the holidays and just a low billing month in February. So Q1 always slow in CIS. So Q2 is more of a normalized trend that I would expect to settle in around there, subject to impact coming from the ruble as you probably seen starting its fall again in July.
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Malonivich from UBS.
Stephen Malonivich: Last one for me Anthony. Can you just give us the bridge between GAAP and non-GAAP for the full year and the quarter?
Anthony Conte: So the bridge thing, go through the specific items or amounts, or what specifically do you mean?
Stephen Malonivich: Sure, there will be great, if you could just go through expectations for stock comp.
Anthony Conte: I’m sorry, the forecast demand?
Stephen Malonivich: Yes, please.
Anthony Conte: So the stock comp should remain relatively consistent for the balance of the year, looking at probably 11.4 million to 11.5 million per quarter for the second half. And then amortization of intangibles should be around 1.5 million per quarter. And FX; I’m putting FX in a roughly about million a quarter in loss and we’ll see where that settles out. I mean FX is always our big kind of capture because nobody knows where exactly it's going to go exactly.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Ivan Belyaev from SberBank.
Ivan Belyaev: Good afternoon, this is actually Joya Gurcheva [ph] from SberBank. Just curious on your guidance that you have up by about 14 million to 15 million. How much that is coming from navigation arch?.
Anthony Conte: Sure I'd kind of address this one earlier. With navigation arch it's very difficult to separate it out, because we have already actually began integration of nav arch and our go-to-market approach is much more integrated than really any other acquisition we’ve done in the past. So there is no clear separation. Roughly speaking we said about 50-50 is the split of organic in that arch, but again that line is heavily blurred as we’ve already done a lot of integration and we’re really moving forward as one company especially with a lot of their existing clients.
Ivan Belyaev: Is it possible then maybe to comment on just the revenue base of the company approach to your acquisition and maybe to talk about the cost?
Anthony Conte: No, I am sorry, we don't really share that information.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen we’ve reached the end of our question and answer session. I’d like to turn the floor back to Arkadiy Dobkin for closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you everybody again for participation today. So it was a good quarter for us and again no any specific news; we just probably good as well, too good. So we’ll be talking to you in three months and therefore good day today. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the EPAM Systems First Quarter 2015 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Ms. Lilya Chernova, IR Coordinator. Thank you, ma'am. You may begin.
Lilya Chernova: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter 2015 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website at epam.com. The speakers on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Anthony Conte, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Arkadiy?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Lilya and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I am pleased to report that while the first quarter showed some continuum challenges, primarily with the currency volatility in several of our markets. It proved to be another strong quarter for EPAM and a solid start to the year. We closed with revenue of US$200 million, above consensus and top end of the guidance, and 25% growth over prior year. It was down sequentially about 1% which is relatively common for first quarter as we deal this quarter this in January and short billion months in February and sometimes slow start to customer budget allocations. Margins also closed strongly, with 16.7% adjusted operating margin, 30 basis point above last year. Taken in account the foreign exchange and currency volatility remains a big part of our story in Q1, I would like to state right up front that our revenue in Q1 2015 based approximately a 9% headwind when compared to Q1 2014, meaning our constant growth was about 34%. At the same time the impact of adjusted operating margin show that we remain naturally relatively hedged with a total impact from constant currency being less than 1 million tailwind or less than 3% impact on adjusted income from operation. With that note, I will let Anthony dive deeper into numbers and the currency impact explanation. I will be able to brief today with my updates on the business. Partially because we already described our approach and our differentiation points in regards to EPAM move into digital engagement space. We talked about that in many details during our calls last year. And partially because Q1 is still just beginning of the year and it's too early to evaluate any new trends in our activities in comparison with what we did during our previous call when we talked about 2014 results and our overall plans for 2015. So the first quarter for us was a continuation of the gross strategy we've began several years back as a part of EPAM 2015 region. And while we continue to face many of the same challenges still today we are also starting to see dividends on our decisions to focus on the system of engagement space and in many investments we did during the last period. As always we continue to focus on global competencies in co-engineering and advanced technology and on big data and analytics and other drivers of digital engagements. And all that while having a very focused approach to regional and local team building. We believe very much that closely align hybrid capabilities is a key component in our ability to deliver quality solutions which drive in the system for engagement and allowing our clients to stay competitive. That is why our major continuous effort today are to push harder to the highest level of engagement between the new strategy capabilities which we're developing organically and non-organically during the last several years. And even more importantly into very strong environment results additional strengths, high quality software engineering and advanced technology services. For us understanding that EPAM is about building hybrid teams of strategies experienced designers architects developers and business consultants means that we are working very hard to building this team not just in general but very much where they need to be present and to connect this client better for certain programs. So while we expand in the presence for such teams in our traditional markets in North America and Europe, we're also very focused to improve such capabilities in APAC region where we started to operate during last year and to have already for strong traction and now we want to expand in new fast locations including the most recent one in Guadalajara, Mexico. In addition to that, we are continuing to invest in developing capabilities in our key focused industries. We believe that EPAM will ultimately successful precisely because we understand the technology platform exist in the context of specific industry needs and we also know that many of the industries are going through massive disruption and shifts due to technology changes. We are excited to see the examples of how we're increasingly able to help bridge the business with technology and life science and financial services companies. I wanted to say just a few words about our still new capabilities and digital strategy and service design and how those fit into our broader positioning. We do believe that combining those increase very strong product development mindset which we develop over the years should become the true driver for us and not just in digital engagement but also in helping to address the full scope of some of the transformational programs by helping clients to find very new solutions to connect digital and physical world together and make total customer experience, more natural and transparent for simply intuitive if you will [ph]. Such type of opportunities we now see on the market more and more and we are starting to play a role in those very exciting new engagements. We hope to share some interesting stories on these subjects in near future. Finally as in the past 2014 we continue to educate the market about our progress in all directions. Further it included us as a strong performer in B2B commerce wave and in terms - capability wave. We also have seen increased clarity from analyst including Gartner and Everest in our traditional industry chapters, and are starting to recover it in new - life science and healthcare. With that I will turn to Anthony to give more structural information and to provide our guidance for this 2015.
Anthony Conte: Thank you Ark. Good morning everyone. I'll spend a few minutes taking you through the first quarter results then I'll talk more about our outlook for Q2 and the full year. As usual you can find the full details of our results in our press release and our quarterly factsheet located in the investor section of our website. As Ark mentioned 2015 opened with another solid quarter of revenue just over 200 million and 24.7% over the last year. Currency headwinds remained compressing our Q1 revenue by about 9% meaning in constant currency terms we would have grown 33.7% over Q1 2014. The final reported results came in above guidance and consensus by about 1%. Sequentially, we were down about 1% from Q4 which is not uncommon for the first quarter. However in constant currency terms we would have grown about 1.4%. The key currency mix of our revenue in Q1 has remained pretty consistent with what I shared at year end, 16% of our revenues remain US dollar based, the Pound is at 13%, Euros at 7% Canadian and Swiss francs are in 6% and the Ruble has dropped to 3%. North America remains our largest segment, representing 52.3% of our Q1 revenues, up 32.3% year-over-year. Europe was up 18.1% year-over-year representing 39.7% in Q1 revenue. In constant currency terms EU would have been up 30% year-over-year. CIS continues to struggle and is down 26.9% year-over-year, and 36.4% sequentially, representing only 4.4% of revenue in Q1. The dynamics of the drop is both currency and volume related and in constant currency terms CIS would have been up 13% year-over-year but still down 28% sequentially. Our top 20 accounts came in at 57.6% of revenue growing 24%, while all other clients grew 27% year-over-year. The increased concentration of the top 20 is mainly driven by continued strength in UBS account which grew 54% year-over-year and 12% sequentially to represent 15.4% of revenue in Q1. Turning to our expenses. We completed the quarter with over 12,600 IT professionals, an increase of about 29.8% compared to Q1 2014. Approximately 8% of this growth was from acquisitions, bringing the organic headcount growth to about 22%. Currency generated some benefits to the cost of revenue in the quarter, when compared to prior year. There was approximately 12% benefit and 3% versus prior quarter. The allocation of our currencies across expense based also remains fairly consistent with the guidance I provided roughly 63% of the U.S. dollar, 7% from Ruble-based; 8% in the Hungarian forint; and 5% in the British pound. The balance are insignificant. Utilization for the quarter was at 77.6%, essentially flat to Q4. GAAP income from operations increased 4.4% year-over-year to represent 11.4% of revenue in the quarter. GAAP IFL include stock-based compensation expenses, and certain acquisition-related costs that we exclude from our non-GAAP measures. Stock-based compensation expense for the first quarter increased 185% over prior year, 50% of the total Q1 charge and 62% of this increase is related to acquisitions. If you exclude acquisitions, stock comp is up 92%, however total outstanding non-acquisition related equity grants are up only 16%. So the main driver behind the growth in the stock comp expense is the fact that our stock price is up over 90% this year. Our non-GAAP income from operations for the quarter after all these adjustments increased 27% over prior year to 33.4 million representing 16.7% of revenue. For the quarter, we generated $0.61 of non-GAAP EPS, above the top end of our guidance and $0.29 of GAAP EPS based on approximately 51 million shares diluted outstanding. The GAAP EPS shortfall is primarily caused by two main issues. First, non-operating foreign currency losses exceeded our estimate by about $4 million, resulting in about $0.08 negative impact on GAAP EPS. Many of our entities hold assets and liabilities and currencies different from the local currency. Each period is measured and the unrealized gain loss goes to our P&L. The strength of the US dollar versus EU currencies mainly the Euro at the end of Q1 created this loss. The second issue impacting GAAP EPS is driven by a significant increase in our share price in Q1 which caused a larger than expected mark-to-market charge related to stock issued in connection with acquisitions, resulting in approximately $0.02 impact on GAAP EPS. Together this resulted in a $0.10 negative impact on GAAP EPS. Our balance sheet remained strong. We finished the quarter with approximately $222 million of cash, up 2 million from December 31st. During the first quarter, operating activities generated approximately 6 million of cash. Unbilled revenues were at 88 million as of March 31st. Accounts receivable were at $105 million and DSO ended the quarter at approximately 50 days. Turning to our guidance. Based on current conditions, we reaffirm our guidance for the full year. We expect year-over-year revenue growth to be 21% to 23%. Non-GAAP net income growth for 2015 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 22%, with an effective tax rate of approximately 20%. For the second quarter of 2015 EPAM expects revenues between $213 million and $215 million, representing a growth rate of 22% to 23% over the second quarter of 2014. Second quarter 2015 non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.62 to $0.64 based on an estimated second quarter 2015 weighted average share count of 51.2 million shares. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.30 to $0.32. With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to the operator and open up for Q&A. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. At this time we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Good morning and good quarter. I guess my first question is trying to figure out how much incremental from the time you gave guidance to now, how much incremental FX headwind are you absorbing in your guidance for the full year?
Anthony Conte: Versus when we gave guidance you're asking, I didn't hear the first part, I’m sorry.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Yeah versus when you spend.
Anthony Conte: It was about $2 million with additional headwind beyond what we gave guidance on Q1.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: No, I meant for the full year.
Anthony Conte: For the full year we haven't changed our expectations on headwinds for the full year. The difference between when we gave guidance and today wasn't material enough to shift so we're still looking at about 6% headwinds on the full year but clearly there is going to be more headwinds in Q1 and Q2 versus Q3 and Q4 because 2014 it was that latter half of the year when FX started to ramp so we expect to see more impact earlier in the year and less than the back half but our expectations are still by around that 6% headwind.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay. And I guess the follow on is really I mean you guys are growing at pretty hectic pace and in what seems like all the right areas. The headcount growth if you could address what challenges you faced with regards to hiring, training and the capability to keep ramping that at a healthy pace.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Ashwin, this is like difficult question because that's the challenge you see in all the work and this is like as you know the shortage of talent and I answer this questions many times. So we really invest in multiple areas since that of the company to support all kind of software engineering skills because while we're seeing that the problem with vendor most of our competitors at the same time don't want to lose this advantage. And I certainly - we share this couple times like what investment we do - we have special division of the company which focusing only on this. We dramatically expanded our talent acquisition capability during the last couple of years. I also mentioned that we brought two years ago the person from large competitor who experienced already what that means real scale when you need to hire not just thousands people but tenths of thousands of people. So our talent acquisition led by such person and he put a lot of efforts to make it scalable. So universal relationships very, very strong. So we expand in different geographies of the world, we open couple additional offices in Central Eastern Europe as you know we now operate in [indiscernible] we also open operation in Guadalajara in Mexico at the end of last year. So and one of the key challenges is actually how to integrate the additional skills and advance consultant skills which now is a very big and digital skills, which is very big advantage which we have and if we can combine them right and this is different type of people, it's very difficult to bring them to work as a team, so this is a lot of efforts which we put in. So in general like it's probably separate discussion for multiple hours if you'd like to say it and also during the analyses they mentioned our internal systems which is part of this to how to bring people together and how to do assessments right and we're learning from the best of our clients and as you know we have some best names in technology as our clients so we're learning from this and I can continue for long time.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: No that's actually pretty good color I mean part of the reason to ask as you know is that as you grow in each time 20% growth means more people if compared to volume.
Arkadiy Dobkin: It's not, and you understand it's not just about more people it's about what type of people and how they're working together because we obviously change in the portfolio of our kind of engagements as well. So it's more solution based or sometimes end-to-end implementations and this is very different categories of people and how projects implemented so it's a lot of training not just from half qualified people but actually from the processes and this part.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay. My last quick question was have you updated that the onsite headcount percentage metric, is there a new target you guys used to have it.
Arkadiy Dobkin: We don't have specific target like we had couple years ago to achieve 10%. What I can tell that it's definitely going to be increasing with the time and we probably need to assess a little bit, the situation before we can target on our self but the trend definitely to increase on short component.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Great. Thank you and congratulations.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Kupferberg: Thanks. Good morning guys. Congrats on the numbers. Just wanted to talk a little bit more about the full year outlook and make sure we understand kind of the moving parts as we go through the year and look at the year-over-year growth rates by quarter because obviously here in Q1 you came out ahead of guidance no matter how you slice it with currency, without currency etc. You're maintaining the full year as you said so that would obviously imply that you're expecting some deceleration in year-over-year growth during the remainder of the year. Is some of that just lapping of acquisitions maybe you can remind us how much inorganic revenue contribution there was in Q1 and how much was embedded in the full year guide of 21 to 23 in terms of acquisition contribution?
Anthony Conte: Well we don’t really separate out our forecast the organic versus inorganic when we do our planning we pretty much did the planning as one consolidated entity and most of these acquisitions have actually been fully integrated at this point so separating them is actually quite difficult. I can give you a view on actuals in Q1 and it's a rough separation but if you look at from a constant currency basis our growth organically was around 24% excluding the contribution from acquisition that we received in Q1 and that's I would say it's a very rough percentage because a lot of these accounts have been integrated. We've grown them post-acquisition both from the contribution the EPAM side as well as acquisition side so it's very hard to slice them at this point.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Basically to give you like explanation like when they say like this is a number organic we assume kind of deduct and completed the revenue from accounts existed. At companies which we brought here but it doesn't mean that it's really in some cases inorganic revenue because the revenue which increased there probably would deliver it by already EPAM people and capabilities which didn't exist in additional company. So it's a very really difficult to separate. In some situations we increase significant revenue on EPAM historical accounts because we bring in new capabilities from acquiring companies and sometimes it's opposite so it's really difficult to calculate.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. So the implied deceleration, the rest of the year is that more just hey let's be conservative it's only through a quarter or is it more a function of the anniversarying of some of the acquisitions understanding that's it hard to pull out or quantify those...
Arkadiy Dobkin: Well you also have to factor in what’s happening on the CIS I mean we're seeing between currency and volume impacts at CIS we are seeing deceleration there and we're forecasting basically pretty significant drops in the CIS business. So that is decelerating due to the currency and due to the macroeconomic issues going on there. North America and Europe continue to grow in line with expectations. So I think what you're seeing is the blend of the drop we're seeing in CIS, the FX impact that we're anticipating pulling down the overall growth rates of the company, not really pulling them down but smoothing them out as we go through the year.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. Understood. And maybe just a question more generally about the demand environment I mean I know you obviously don't give like a bookings metric per se but just qualitatively can you talk about what the environment look like through the first four months or so the year just in terms of your ability to compete for and win brand new business either at existing clients or adding new logos?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think from where we are it seems like pretty healthy environment and as I mentioned before while we're growing like 25%, 30% during the last several years even after IPO we still relatively small glare of this global market and I don't think in this niche of services which we provided we can see any changes during this year’s so I think there is pretty strong demand and the whole point how to provide quality at this point.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. And then just last one from me on the supply side, I know you talked about all the investments in hiring recruiting etc. Do you have any statistics off hand for example in terms of the percent of job offers that you guys make that are accepted just trying to get a sense of your success rate your hit rate as you obviously try and focus on not only recruiting the right number of people but the right type of people.
Arkadiy Dobkin: You know I, we probably have all the statistics but we never provided for this call and I don't have on top of my head but what I can tell you that clearly EPAM become much more attractive company for talented people because we're from main recognitions there is significant improvement versus several years ago. So I think it's getting better. I know this from multiple specific cases but I don't have statistics right now.
Jason Kupferberg: Okay. Understood. Thank you for the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Moshe Katri: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Good quarter. A couple of follow-ons, one did you provide a revenue breakdown by verticals for during the call, I missed that.
Anthony Conte: No I stop quoting them, they come out on our factsheet which you can get but I can read through them real quick if you'd like.
Moshe Katri: Sure. Let's start with financial services.
Anthony Conte: It was 28.3% [ph] of revenue.
Moshe Katri: And growth?
Anthony Conte: Growth was hang on, it's on a different sheet. Growth was year-on-year 19.4%.
Moshe Katri: Okay.
Anthony Conte: ISV was 22.2% of revenue and growth of 27.7%.
Moshe Katri: Yeah,
Anthony Conte: Information and media was 13.1% of revenue and 24.7% growth. Trial on consumer 21.8% of revenue and 20% growth. Life sciences which we started breaking out this quarter for the first time it's 7.2% of revenue and like almost 200% growth but it's mainly driven by the acquisition of GGI and NetSoft.
Moshe Katri: Okay, great. That's helpful.
Anthony Conte: And then the other is balanced.
Moshe Katri: And then UBS you said was up 54% for the quarter that accounted for 15% of revenues, I think it will be helpful if you kind of get us some color in terms of what's going on in this account, what you're doing more there what sort of traction you're getting and then should we expect that mix to continue to move higher greater than 15% in the upcoming quarters.
Anthony Conte: Well as you may remember I mean Jointech, the acquisition we did in APAC was mostly from all UBS revenues when we acquire them so the jump year on year is driven in big part by that plus if you look at the UBS growth last year 2014 it grew almost 100% year-over-year from 13 to 14. So it's really just the continuation of that growth in Q1 and the impact of that growth on the Q1 numbers.
Arkadiy Dobkin: But we weren't like - digital program at the beginning of last year and this program is still growing and it's difficult to predict to the speed of this account because we did potentially some specific projects and it's not like just incremental increase in headcount and some other areas. So we will see.
Moshe Katri: How large was Barclays during the quarter?
Anthony Conte: Barclays was about 5.7% of our revenue in the quarter.
Moshe Katri: Okay. And then Arkadiy you spoke about increased traction in APAC could you talk about that in terms of what we've seen so far year-to-date out of Asia and I'm assuming it's coming via the acquisition that you made last year.
Arkadiy Dobkin: As Anthony mentioned acquisition mostly, not mostly almost like 100% was focused on UBS account and for us it was a move necessary to get involved in the global digital program which was started from APAC. So we need the resources there and we need like very good strong engineering capabilities there. So what happen now that now having kind of hubs there we started to bring new clients in the region, most of these international companies plus we have multiple opportunities for existing client where we operate globally? So and we hope that we will kind of replicate the UBS situation where - North America or Western Europe we will serving needs of this clients in the region and we see there is tractions.
Moshe Katri: Okay did you staff the 700 or so seats that you have in China?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Excuse me, what?
Moshe Katri: With the acquisition I remember you had about 700 seats of delivery out of China, have you staffed these or you're considering staffing them?
Arkadiy Dobkin: You mean for all the space -
Moshe Katri: Yes.
Arkadiy Dobkin: No, it's not completely staffed now.
Moshe Katri: Okay. And then final question.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we still have in China specifically like around 300 people between China.
Moshe Katri: Okay. And the attrition for the quarter, that's last question.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Attrition for the quarter was right around 7%.
Moshe Katri: Remind us how does that compare for last quarter?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Its low we've typically been around 10%, 11% so this quarter came in quite low around 7.
Moshe Katri: Well impressive. Okay guys. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Stephen Malonivich [ph] with UBS. Please process with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. Good morning. This is Peter in for Steve. Thanks for taking my question. In regards to the headcount I mean this was the largest sequential gain you've had excluding acquisitions can you give us a sense of where the employee growth was and was it more juniors versus lateral hires and are you also seeing any wage pressure in constant terms.
Arkadiy Dobkin: You're talking about headcount increase right?
Unidentified Analyst: Correct.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Go ahead.
Anthony Conte: It was about 7% sequential growth. There is nothing special unique about that we've continue to hire in line with our needs and to staff the project that we have utilization remain relatively constant. It’s part of what has grown supported the over performance in the quarter is the additional headcount to service the revenues that we have - Ark if you have anything more.
Arkadiy Dobkin: If you look at our account of the floor it's a little bit bulky so and for example end of last year it was very high utilization over 80% I think.
Anthony Conte: Yeah in the quarter.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So in the quarters we were doing - now probably we will start to utilize and we have percent of - relatively high in Belarus and now Ukraine we're spending like two, three sometimes like six months on internal training as well. So that's kind of normal and then you will see that its utilization will be a little bit higher.
Unidentified Analyst: And were there any wage, changes in wage pressures?
Arkadiy Dobkin: That's a concrete question taken in account for this currency volatility so because like have to look at this but I'll give...
Anthony Conte: Yeah I mean overall blended wage increases that we saw last year were about 4% to 5% in a local currency base but FX helped us tremendously on this front and the overall wage inflation that we felt in US dollar terms was close to zero. So it almost the FX benefits almost completely negated the wage inflation that we felt which is what you see, you see that in our gross margin pick up. We picked up over a percentage in our gross margin. A lot of that is driven by the FX benefits that we received because of the neutralization of the wage inflation.
Unidentified Analyst: That's helpful. And then relative to last year do you think M&A will pick up in the next couple of quarters?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Peter we will see.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then finally number of larger vendors including Century, Capgemini even Congress [ph] have had strong quarters particularly on quoting growth in digital particularly in North America. When you're competing for new deals are you seeing more competition coming to the table and have you seen any change in your win rates for new business?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So again just based on our [indiscernible] I think competition is increasing but in my opinions market and demand increasing if not with the fact probably faster than capabilities of delivery. So this is very interesting market and I think there are lot of spread there, lot of people trying to build up capabilities quickly and it's not so simple especially that it's not just kind of creative for digital parts which is lot of people put into together many small agencies and trying to compete but actually how to deliver this complete stuff and integrate in existing system. I think it's - on the surface competition is growing but quality delivery is still is very much in demand.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for the commentary.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Mayank Tandon: Thank you. Good morning. Ark you mentioned earlier about the challenges in terms of hiring people. I'm just wondering are you exploring other delivery locations whether it's Asia or Latin America or even India to diversify your delivery overtime and maybe that can help mitigate some of the challenges that you face in terms of hiring.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Number one, I don't remember when we didn't have challenges probably when we were very small and nobody wanted to work in Belarus and Ukraine then you can hire as many people as you want but then after this unfortunately changed. So but we open couple new locations in Central Europe now operating Bulgaria. We grow in Poland, we still grow in Hungary. We grow in our traditional locations in Belarus, Ukraine. And in Russia as well because now we have after acquisition of GGA we have interesting hub in Russia for western clients too. But we also as you know open in China and we had in China. While again our development center they have more like a front oasis for APAC region not just deliver location for global market. We also open as I mentioned in Guadalajara, Mexico just recently, it's very much just Greenfield operations. So couple people there but we have already some clients starting with us to operate there. So we have some other plans but it's too early to share. So I mean it's nothing unusual this quarter or last quarter it’s part of our day-to-day kind of year-by-year challenges.
Mayank Tandon: Great. Okay, that's very helpful. And then I know in the past you've also talked about most of your business historically was won through referrals but over the last 18 months or so you've been investing in the sales force and just wanted to get a sense of how that's progressing in terms of impacting new logo wins and also expanding your relationships with existing customers.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I would say that I don't see any bad from having referrals and I think that's probably the very good source of business which talking about reputation and quality of the delivery and I think it's still relatively big portion of our business and I hope that it's continue to be relatively big portion for our business which is not so uncommon actually for services operations when we need like to have hundreds clients not thousand clients and millions clients. So at the same time we definitely improve during the last several quarters, our marketing and sales operation so which is also bringing new opportunities like we talked about our brand recognition from industry analyst and becoming some strong performers or leaders in multiple categories which is helping us to get new opportunities and equip our sales teams. We also have new head of North American sales, we've brought regarding sales people. We change in sales people as usual. So this is normal for us. Just to give you kind of very simple metric which probably illustrate what's going to like we just calculated just during the last six months we have at least 20 account which already on 1 million plus run rate and some of them 3 million or 5 million and probably 5, 6 is the accounts could be 10 million accounts for example. And this kind of brand new logos which we brought during the Q1 and Q4.
Mayank Tandon: Great, that’s great color. And then just two final questions from me, for Anthony. Anthony, I don't know if you mentioned this earlier but what was the pricing uptick in the quarter and what are you building in for fiscal '15 guidance and then finally also utilization over the number in the quarter and then what does it trend for the rest of the year?
Anthony Conte: Sure. Pricing which sticking with kind of 6% to 8% range and that's what we're seeing. A lot of that is unfortunately being neutralized by FX as well same with our wage inflation but that's the base that we're building in. Utilization for the quarter came in at 77.6 and our forecast is pretty much holding that steady throughout the year so it will be kind of 76%, 77% throughout the year. We'll see a little bit of, we forecasted normal dip in Q3 which is a typical vacation cycle and that picks up in Q4. So I'm taking on average for the whole year.
Mayank Tandon: Okay. Thank you. Good job on the quarter.
Anthony Conte: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
David Grossman: Thank you. I just had two very quick follow-ups. First I think you had mentioned that first quarter is typically a flattish sequential quarter which was obviously different than the way you guided at three months ago. Just curious whether the guide three months ago, did that reflect exogenous factors like currency unrest on the Ukraine or whatever it may have been or did in fact going into the quarter did you generally believe that there were fundamental reasons to think that you would be down sequentially more than you have been historically.
Anthony Conte: I think that when we did the forecasting we always anticipate a much slower Q1 ramp. We did see some things happening a little bit earlier this year similar to last year which benefited the quarter. I mean the over perform was only a $2 million so it wasn't a significant strike and everything else is pretty much in line with where we're expected there is nothing unusual on the quarter we just had$2million of over perform from some of our customers ramping things little bit faster.
David Grossman: Okay. And then just secondly getting back to your largest customer which is outpacing the growth of the rest of the business and now it's 15% of revenue can you just help us understand how you're thinking about the growth in that talent permanent or is it relates to the risk overall risk of the business in the future in terms of how it could impact growth if in fact that account does decelerate overtime.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think so the growth partially due acquisition as we mentioned right. So we also growing in this account in very different areas and we open couple new kind of areas, specific loans is large digital program. So I don't see this as a danger at 15 or even let's say 20% which I don't think we're going to get, okay. So, taken in account like sales of top five or top 10 or top 20 accounts which we have. I think we're still pretty well balanced.
David Grossman: Can you help us understand how many components Ark that exist within that account whether it'd be geographically or within divisions...
Arkadiy Dobkin: This is very diverse account. We're working now in three continents. We're working in Europe. We're working in North America. We're working in APAC and in Asia, this is a significant business then we're working across different business lines, then we're working from delivery point of view again this is like Hungary, Poland, Ukraine, Switzerland, UK, China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. So this is like very kind of spread activities across on this.
David Grossman: Okay. And then just third, Anthony I'm wondering can you give us what we should model for the non-GAAP adjustments for the year first Barclays comp and the intangibles amortization etc.
Anthony Conte: Sure. I can do that. So stock comp is going to come in Q2 right around 11.8 million and then it will kind of drop to 11.3 and 11.4 in Q3 and Q4 so you'll end up the year around 43.7 and as far as amortization of intangibles. It's going to be about 1.4 million per quarter going forward.
David Grossman: Great. Alright guys. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Darrin Peller: Thanks guys. Listen I just want to follow up first on the strong growth at UBS I mean obviously it's continuing to pace well even organically and I guess one question is just if the client itself as UBS itself has any parameters as to whether or not how much it's willing to work with any given vendor, I know it also works with one of your large competitors. So where can that go without them getting worry about risk management in there. And then I guess just a follow-up on that is the growth rate of your top 10 I think we're calculating around a mid-teen maybe 16%, 17% growth rate of the top 10 clients excluding UBS although I think currency is probably playing a big part in that given imagine at least one of them is out of the Russia region. So can you just give us some color on the organic constant currency growth of the other nine of your top 10?
Anthony Conte: You want to take the UBS question first.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think in the UBS question I don't know what to add already to really kind of talk about it. When David asked the question and previously as well. So I think Anthony you're trying to...
Darrin Peller: What I'm trying to figure out if there is going to continue to be comfortable working with any one give vendor when...
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. I believe the clients have some internal policy. How much business they can give.
Darrin Peller: Exactly.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we far from this - so we have space to grow and I don't think it's - we're going to reach with our client kind of spread I don't think we're going to reach this agreement.
Darrin Peller: Alright. That's helpful. And then just on the other side of it, just trying to figure out the organic sort of constant currency growth Anthony of the other top 10 clients. Like nine out of the top 10 because I know UBS is a big driver still.
Anthony Conte: Yeah UBS is definitely a large driver and looking at the other top accounts it's about - most of them are primarily USD based with a little bit of a mix of Canadian in there. So I think from a constant currency perspective let's say Barclays will have a mix, yeah it's not going to be dramatically different, I don't have that number at my fingertips Darrin.
Darrin Peller: Okay. We could follow-up with that.
Anthony Conte: I'd say there is going to be some Euro and some Canadian impacts.
Arkadiy Dobkin: On top 10 like the biggest impact coming from one Canadian client which weakened Canadian dollars dropped almost 25%.
Darrin Peller: Right.
Anthony Conte: And Barclays which is going to be a mixed account. They have a heavy US dollar.
Darrin Peller: Okay. I just had one follow-up I mean you guys had some, it was some pretty good media around I think the contract with the SEC and it just seems like another sort of area of growth potential for you guys. Can you just comment on that for a moment and how that's been where the opportunity is there?
Arkadiy Dobkin: On this project we reached Securities Exchange Commission as I mentioned multiple times during the course we were proud of being selected in the short leads but we're not really thinking that we can win this deal realistically taken the size of the deal and kind of some government requirements, We might have opportunity like one of our goals were to get there to make sure that we will be able to work in this area where implementation of this regulations would be first and it would be lot of work and we already kind of attached our name on this specific subject matter.
Darrin Peller: Okay. It must be earlier in the call.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So but we like we for example in financial services we started to work with two large banks and both of them will be growing now pretty significantly so this is like not like we started to work with couple large retailers on - opportunities. So it's as I mentioned like just in last six months we have 20 new names with 1 million plus run rate already.
Darrin Peller: And a number of those, I think you also mentioned a number of those were new logos right?
Arkadiy Dobkin: That's what I was mentioning.
Darrin Peller: Yeah that's great.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Specifically new logos.
Darrin Peller: That's great. Alright great. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.
James Friedman: Hi, most of my questions have been answered but Ark you were mentioning in your opening remarks that budgets would sometimes can be tentative in the first quarter, our preceding, I think you said more predictively. I was just wondering if you could articulate in which areas budgets may have a better cadence like specifically either by industry or by service line.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don't think I can give any specific details of this. So because it's probably to - most of the accounts and industries as well. I don't have any specific kind of split.
James Friedman: In terms of your say digital practice. Is that the same buyer as what you have sold in the past in other words are you selling more into the Chief Marketing Officers as opposed to Chief Technology Officer or the financial office?
Arkadiy Dobkin: This is again everybody talking about it so I don't think I'll give you any different number. It's definitely there is shift from traditional IT to more business, we're working with business leaders in specific areas and we're working with horizontal kind of digital leaders at our client side. This is definitely increasing very rapidly and we sell into this business and digital people on client side probably still not more than IT people but definitely increasing proportion.
James Friedman: Okay. I think at your Analyst Day, you had a number of examples of that as my last question of that is I think you had said at the Analyst Day that we had a couple of significant reference able accounts this was on March 6th. Yeah so if you could talk to the growth of some of those accounts that presented at the Analyst Day and if there have been any further update, Canadians Tire, Google in particular.
Arkadiy Dobkin: All this accounts like Canadian Tire CTO was present there I think he said I don't think I can do any better than he did and this is still growing account for us clearly it's a little bit more difficult taken in account that Canadian dollars dropped so significantly. So but we have number of growing accounts. I'm not going to mention specific but we have all our top 10 growing and we have number below growing fast and digital growing faster.
James Friedman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Arvind [ph] with Arden Research. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I know you already touched upon this but just wanted to see if I could dig a little bit deeper. So by math or the math has done the four acquisitions in 2014 contributed about $40 million to EPAM revenues on a partial year basis. So in on a full year revenue basis aggregate revenue from this four acquisitions may have been like 60 million to 70 million. And sort of assuming that they'll continue to grow in 2015 they may contribute I don't know $70 million, $80 million. So based on this it looks like your guidance maybe conservative given some of the acquisition related revenue that will kick in. So is it mostly like FX and CIS business at play for kind of guiding to kind of 21%, 23% guidance.
Anthony Conte: Well I mean 23% considers about a 6% headwind from currency. So in constant currency terms we're projecting kind of 29% growth which I don't think is conservative at all. I think that you have to also factor in what I had said earlier about the CIS region where that is dropping we're anticipating that dropping roughly 40% year-on-year through both currency impacts and just sheer volume impacts because of the economic situation in the CIS region. So I would counter and so I don't think that 21 to 23 is conservative taking into account the 6% currency headwinds that we are factoring into that number and the issues that we're facing within the CIS region.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. That's helpful and just one question instead of the competitive environment I mean how much of your business is kind of your going head-to-head with the US firm versus Indian firms versus sort of the in house kind of IT spend essentially kind of greenfield opportunities. And have you all been in a situation where you all are kind of competing with these firms one on one and the dynamic change over the last couple of years if you can maybe provide some examples that'll be great.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Definitely we see in all around all this line of competitors, we compete with smaller US based or European based consultancy type of firms focusing specifically on e-commerce or digital or content, complete content management engagements. So we compete with these guys. We compete with Accenture, and IBM on specific engagements and with special dividends and we definitely compete with many companies with [indiscernible] so this is like all over the place and we it's a luxury to compete one you really compete against four or five of them simultaneously. So and I don't know like what exactly to answer here, yes we like - opinion with in many cases we take in share from existing business from this completion in some case we get into very kind of greenfield initial deals and results. So but right now the competition all over the place.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you very much and best of luck for 2015.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Alex Veytsman with Monness, Crespi, Please proceed with your question.
Alexander Veytsman: Yeah just wanted to dig further on some of the verticals specifically on the IC technology it looks like that the growth rate has accelerated this quarter about 28% about 14 just wanted to ask you for some, what were some of the drivers behind that growth and also how should we be thinking about it throughout the year for the next three quarters.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So specifically would kind of IC growth.
Alexander Veytsman: Right I mean the drivers going to would lead to the top line growth acceleration in that vertical and does that kind of a growth rate sustainable for the next three quarters?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think again this is not growing faster than we grow in general so I don't see any unusual stuff here. And this is very kind of traditional historically very strong - at EPAM and even like three years ago when right after IPO when we described our strategy we mentioned that we would like to keep our IC businesses around 20%-25% if possible because we would like to be in the world in all new technology trends and kind of feel - what's happening in this because that given advantage to usher new ideas and strong hands on experience with this new technologies to our corporate clients. So we have special group focusing on this and this is practically business as usual for us. So I don't see any special here but we still would like give significant portion of our business in independence of vendors in technology segment.
Alexander Veytsman: Got it. And then for the life sciences I mean this is I mean like obviously new segment here, how should we be thinking about the growth rates for the remainder of the year, I mean obviously it's ramping up so the growth I mean we would expect the growth will be faster than other verticals.
Arkadiy Dobkin: You know that we not kind of given guidance on specific segments. So at the same time clearly we considering this as an interesting perspective for us. We still want in so we had it's not like all new-new business for us because we plan in this field a little bit it was kind of part of our other revenue now we consolidating this in life science and healthcare. So we clearly hoping that this would grow faster than the rest of the business at least initially. So and we see very interesting opportunities in the field taken in account that we brought probably with this acquisitions at least half of that Fortune 500 companies on our client list and that could be double and triple or more during the next couple years. So but I don't think we can give you any specific predictions right now.
Alexander Veytsman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And it appears we have no additional questions at this time. I would like to floor back over to Mr. Dobkin for any additional concluding comments.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. As usual thank you very much for listening to us and asking questions and hope we will have good conversation in three months from now again. Thank you.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the EPAM Systems Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Lilya Chernova. Thank you, you may begin.
Lilya Chernova: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website at epam.com. The speakers on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Anthony Conte, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Arkadiy?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Lilya. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I am pleased to report that while the fourth quarter showed some challenges, primarily with the currency volatility in several of our markets and the continuing conflict in the Ukraine, it proved to be another strong quarter for EPAM. So despite of all that, we closed with revenue of USD 202.2 million, above consensus and at top end of guidance, it's 28% over prior year and 5% above last quarter. While I would note that this was the first quarter for us with over $200 million in revenue and we were very proud of that, I still would like to highlight the fact that if you look at our results in constant-currency basis, year-over-year growth would have been close to 37%, and sequentially Q4 would show 9% growth. Clearly, Russian rubles were the primary challenge but we also had exposure related to the euros, pounds, Canadian dollars and Swiss francs. For the full 2014, we are finishing at the top end of our guidance at USD 730 million, which is 31% over previous year. At the same time, please note that for those last 12 months we lost approximately $15 million in revenue, making our constant currency growth at 34.2% for the full year. Anthony will provide more detail into the financial results and more clarity around the currency situation and impact on the full P&L. At this moment, I would like to share some highlights to 2014, which was a very different year than we expected 12 months ago when we tried to predict our future. For the first time in our history, we've had to deal not with high-tech or general financial crises as we experienced in 2000 and 2001 and then in 2008 and 2009. But with the large scale political and not only political crisis in Northern countries for EPAM has thousand of talented people and important operational infrastructure. This wasn't something we or anybody around us anticipated when we prepared ourselves for 2014. As a result, during this year, we had to make many adjustment to our original plans, and act very much in real time, to be able to continuously deliver while addressing many unusual challenges. Today, 12 months later, we can say that 2014 was actually another year of growth and strategic exploration at EPAM that was very much in line with the growth we communicated since our IPO day, which actually happened almost exactly 3 years ago. During this year, we proved that many of our efforts and investment from prior year indeed brings the company to the next level. We expanded our industry solution focus into a new segment, life science and health care, and very -- we are very excited about prospectives we see in this area, and how we can reapply the experience we accumulated to this new [indiscernible] vertical. We significantly increased our presence in our targeted markets. You probably remember our goal of 10% of people in North America and Western Europe, now we achieved it. We added China, Hong Kong and Singapore to the EPAM map in order to support global strategic programs for our largest clients, which in turn was triggered by our expanded capabilities in digital strategy, experience design and our ability to be in the new [indiscernible] engagements. Last year, we brought into the company one new important capability service design, and now we should be able to help our customers even more, by finding new and innovative solutions to their most complex business problems, and transform their business to meet the demands of their industry-respective challenges. So let me highlight some most important recognitions which illustrate how our clients, in the whole market, sees EPAM progress into our becoming one of the leading software solution providers. First, we won a good number of top innovation awards across our worldwide client base in 2014, and this is a direct client recognition of our new value. I would like to highlight just one. EPAM won the Most Transformative Branch Experience award in the Citi Mobile Challenge, which was an extraordinary event that brought together more than 3,000 developers and 744 teams from 319 cities, 62 countries and 6 continents. It was a virtual competition hosted by Citi that is designed to accelerate digital banking innovation by bringing together the most talented and creative developers and designers in the world, to create cutting-edge applications for Citi digital working platforms. Our effort resulted in 4 ideas that were all selected for the Citi Mobile Challenge finals. Only 60 from initial 744 were selected for this. Our winning project, Citi Concierge, was delivered by EPAM digital engagement practice, which created a personalized experience for customers at Citi branch and provided analytics for the Citi to optimize branch operations. By the way, I just mentioned EPAM digital engagement practice, which is a reflection of our effort to reorganize EPAM in a way to very closely integrated digital strategy in experienced design capabilities and our traditional strong software engineering skills in complex commerce content, mobile, analytical areas. We are really focused on how to blend it together and bring very much integrated value to our clients. We also [indiscernible] as a independent unit which just loosely complement in capabilities. It is very challenging task, but we do believe we are moving into the right direction and we do believe our clients started to recognize the value too. And our digital engagement practice is just one of the examples of EPAM internal transformation, which focuses on bringing new value to the clients. So in result of all that, Forrester Research, the leading global independent research firm, cited EPAM as a global leader in the product development services space, included EPAM in the list of top 10 largest commerce solutions providers, and recognized EPAM as a Primary Agile Service player. Finally, just before the end of the year, EPAM was ranked #3 on the Forbes 2014 list of America best companies under $1 billion and also scored EPAM as the #1 among technology companies on the list. All of this shows the impact we have had at some of our world's greatest companies via the technology solutions we built, the public equation and digital experience we created and the obstacles we have overcome time and time again on behalf of our clients. I think it's now a good moment to also note that during the past year, we put an effort to defining our true self in continuation of what we started several years back. In 2014, we took the time to look at what really drives us at EPAM, what kind of company we want to be, and how indeed our brand should reflect it. As we stated before, we have been engaged in a year-long process to evolve many elements of our brand. We will be changing how we speak and how we look, and at this point, planning to launch our new brand by the end of Q2. With that, I will turn to Anthony to give more structural information and to provide our guidance for this 2015.
Anthony J. Conte: Thank you, Ark. Good morning, everyone. I want to spend a few minutes taking you through the fourth quarter and full-year results, then I'll talk more about our 2015 outlook. As usual, the full details of our results can be found in our press release and on the quarterly fact sheet located in the Investors section of our website. As Ark mentioned, Q4 was another great milestone for EPAM as we had our first quarter of revenue over $200 million. Fourth quarter revenues grew 28.3% over last year and about 5% sequentially to $202.2 million. This was at the top end of our guidance and with a full year, we ended at $730 million, which was 31.5% growth over prior year. The currency situation was clearly a big issue for revenue in this quarter, led by the precipitous decline in the Russian ruble and lesser declines in another key currencies. During the quarter, we lost over $13 million in currency versus last year alone and almost $8 million sequentially. On a constant-currency basis, we grew 36.7% over Q4 last year and 9% sequentially. For the full year, we lost approximately $15 million, making our constant-currency growth 34.2% for the full year. Based on our Q4 currency breakdown, we're still over 60% of our revenue base in U.S. dollars. The great British pound and the euro account for approximately 18%, Canadian dollar is 7%, Swiss franc's at 5% and the Russian ruble is down to only 5%. The remaining 5% is spread across a number of different currencies, none of which account for more than 1% individually. North America remains our largest segment, representing 50.4% of our full-year revenue, up 30.4% year-over-year. Europe was up 42.3% year-over-year now representing 39% of revenue. CIS, given all the troubles, was actually down 15% year-over-year, representing only 7.6% of revenue. Our top 20 accounts came in at 55% of revenue growing 29%, while all other clients grew 35% year-over-year. Turning to the expenses. We completed the quarter with over 11,800 IT professionals, an increase of approximately 27% compared to 2013. Approximately 7% of this growth was from acquisitions, bringing the organic headcount growth to about 20%. Currency generated some benefits to the cost of revenue in the quarter, when compared to prior year and the quarter. There's approximately $9 million of benefit versus prior year and $5 million versus prior quarter. In the interest of providing a full currency picture, the allocation of our currencies across our expense base is roughly 65% in U.S. dollar; 9% was ruble-based; 8% in the Hungarian forint; and 5% was in the great British pound. The remainder are insignificant. Utilization for the quarter was at 77.7%, about 3% higher than Q3. This was primarily due to the heavy vacation months of July and August, and brings the utilization back to levels consistent with the first half of 2014. For the full year, 2014 average utilization ended around 77%. GAAP income from operations increased 3.5% year-over-year to represent 11.9% of revenue in the quarter. For the full year, it increased 12.7% and represents 11.8% of revenue. Our operating results on a GAAP basis include stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, acquisition-related costs and certain other onetime items that we exclude from our non-GAAP measures. Stock-based compensation expense for the fourth quarter increased 141% over prior year, an 87% on a full-year basis. This is mainly related to the stock grants that are issued as part of the acquisitions throughout the year. During the quarter, we had several other onetime events. Due to continued macroeconomic issues in Russia and the pressure that it placed on our customer base there, we had a $2 million goodwill balance that we -- that was related to the 2006 acquisition of Vested Development, Inc. Based on those problems, that goodwill balance became impaired and we had to write that off in Q4. Additionally, as we've mentioned in the past quarters, we've had some troubles related to a contractor in Minsk that was working on the construction of a new building. Additional analysis identified another $1.5 million worth of materials and services that required a write-off in the quarter. Lastly, we had a $1.9 million fair value adjustment related to the GGA acquisition, tied to their contingent consideration, which was able to be resolved at the end of the year as well. Our non-GAAP income from operations for the quarter, after all those adjustments, increased 32% over prior year to $36.2 million, representing 17.9% of revenue. For the full year, it increased 34.1% to $123.1 million or 16.9% of revenue, both within our guidance range of 16% to 18%. None of the onetime items resulted in any tax benefits to the company and therefore, they have the effect of bringing down my GAAP pretax income, thereby increasing my overall tax rate for the quarter to 25.1% and 19.9% for the full year. We do anticipate that our cash tax rate will remain consistent with past years and be somewhere in the mid-teens. However, we're still finalizing our 2014 tax returns. For the quarter, we generated $0.62 of non-GAAP EPS, also above the top end of our guidance, and $0.37 of GAAP EPS based on approximately 50.3 million shares diluted outstanding. Now turning to our balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $220 million of cash, up $29 million from September 30 and $51 million from December 31. During the fourth quarter, operating activities generated approximately $49 million of cash. Unbilled revenues were at $56 million as of December 31, a decrease of about $15 million compared to Q3. Accounts receivable were at $124 million at the end of Q4, and DSO ended the quarter at approximately 57 days. Now turning to our guidance for 2015. Based on the current conditions, EPAM expects the year-over-year revenue growth to be 21% to 23%. Non-GAAP net income growth for 2015 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 22%, year-over-year, with an effective tax rate of approximately 20%. The full year weighted average share count is expected to be approximately 51 million diluted shares outstanding. For the first quarter of 2015, EPAM expects revenues between $196 million and $198 million, representing a growth rate of 22% to 23% over the first quarter of 2014. First quarter 2015 non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.55, based on an estimated first quarter 2015 weighted average share count of 50.7 million. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.35. Since currency is such a theme these days, I did want to provide a bit of clarity around our assumptions for the 2015 forecast. When building the forecast, we used the average 2015 year-to-date rates and assumed they remained consistent throughout the year. We do not attempt to forecast currency movements throughout the year so our forecast is subject to additional swings in key currencies. At this point, we are assuming revenue in U.S. dollars will remain just above the 60% of total, with pound and euro increasing slightly and ruble dropping to under 5% and all other will remain consistent. On the expense side, we anticipate the U.S. dollar concentration to drop slightly as we open new development centers outside of Eastern Europe and have a broader global base of IT professionals paid in their local currencies. Having said that, we still expect to have over 60% of our expense base denominated in U.S. dollars. With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to the operator and open up for Q&A. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen and Company.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Just to be clear, Anthony, looking at your calendar year 2015 guidance, are you factoring any FX headwinds in those numbers or should we kind of consider these more in the line of constant-currency revenue growth guidance?
Anthony J. Conte: What we did for our forecast is we used the average rates over Jan and Feb and built that into it and assumed that stayed constant. So that is what we've used and any movements off of that average will impact our forecast.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, understood. And then, and if -- let's say, we're not looking at the FX headwinds or in the FX volatility, should we assume that this preliminary guidance is going to be to what we've done in the past, which is, we're starting the year pretty conservatively and then assuming that if all the assumptions are correct, the numbers will gradually move higher throughout the year?
Anthony J. Conte: It's hard to say. I mean, obviously, there's a lot of uncertainties with the currency potential. And given where things are going from a -- just a macroeconomic picture in the CIS region, so there's number of variables into that. So this is kind of our view as we sit here today.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: All right. And then follow-up question, your assumptions for organic growth for 2015?
Anthony J. Conte: Well, organic growth is -- it's an interesting picture because we're seeing drops in the CIS region, so it's hard to break that apart. Plus, the acquisitions have been fully integrated at this point so we're actually -- it's difficult to pull apart things like GGA and Jointech, which are now cross-selling between accounts and have become essentially business units within the EPAM infrastructure. Having said that, we're going to see organically a pretty significant drop in our Russia business, both due to the severe currency drop and the macroeconomic situation, which is pulling back from there. But North America and Europe are continuing to grow over 20% in first quarter and will be in the mid-20s for the full year organically. At least that's our view sitting here today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Milunovich with UBS.
Peter Christiansen - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: This is Peter Christiansen in for Steve Milunovich. Anthony, can you talk about the expectations for FX savings to the operating margin? And also, with the new depreciation expense going forward, do you anticipate still having that 17% -- 16% to 17% non-GAAP operating margin in '15?
Anthony J. Conte: The answer to the last question, yes. The operating margin range of 16% to 18% is still our goal for 2015, so we expect to stay in that range. And I'm sorry, Peter, I'm not sure I fully understood the first part of the question.
Peter Christiansen - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So assuming that there will be some operating savings with the currency impact and in addition to a lower depreciation charge going forward, as a result of the recent write-down, can you quantify what that saving could be? And I'm assuming that you're going to reinvest that back into the business throughout the year?
Anthony J. Conte: I assume you are -- the write-down you're speaking to is the Russia goodwill impairment, correct?
Peter Christiansen - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Correct.
Anthony J. Conte: Yes. That, actually, does not get depreciated at all. So goodwill from an accounting perspective does not get depreciated throughout the year, it gets assessed on an annual basis for impairment. If there's no impairment, the balance stays, if there's an impairment, you take the write-down. So there's really no change to our depreciation because of that write-down. It's a onetime event, will not impact anything going forward. And as far as savings from currency, the short answer is most likely. If we have savings and benefits we will continue to use those to invest in the business and keep our operating margin in that 16% to 18% range.
Peter Christiansen - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: That's very helpful. And then, in the beginning of last year, you were predicting 21% to 23%. It looks like on a constant-currency basis, organic growth was somewhere in the high 20s. Can you talk about what really drove that outperformance this year, any specific verticals would be helpful?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it's very much in line with what we've said in during previous calls, like the top line revenue we're growing a lot by financial services but also -- but retail vertical. Plus we added life science and health care, and life science was performing well, too. So -- but probably, the better look would be not specific vertical but what type of work we do, and then that's again, back to our continuous message on mixing digital strategy and experienced design together with our engineering skills and building this new type of systems of engagement. We've won a number of programs during the 2014 which we couldn't even, like, consider that we will be doing, like, in 2012 or even 2013, based on new kind of integration of skills and that was actually driving additional work around these programs as well. I think that probably would be the shortest answer to your question.
Peter Christiansen - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: That's helpful. And then lastly for me, in terms of the currency impact on your cost base, particularly your Russian operation, how have you factored in wage inflation? Is there a potential that you could begin dollar index -- using dollar index to compensate your Russian-based employees?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we're clearly looking at the market situation, labor market situation and right now, we don't see a necessity to do this. And I don't think market reacting in this way to index it to the dollars. But again, we'll be looking at the situation and see what we have to do to be competitive on the labor market.
Anthony J. Conte: Also, Peter, one correction. You'd mentioned organic growth in the high 20s. It was actually, organic growth was more around 25% in 2014.
Peter Christiansen - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Excluding currency?
Anthony J. Conte: On I'm sorry, you said constant currency? Sorry, I missed that piece. But, then you're correct.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Constant currency.
Operator: Our next question comes the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.
Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Just another one on FX to kind of put a fine point on it. So can you just lay out for us exactly what the headwind is assumed? Just -- I know you're holding kind of the 2015 year-to-date rate constant. So does that -- where does that leave us? Is that somewhere in the neighborhood of like an 8% FX headwind that's baked into the 21% to 23%?
Anthony J. Conte: It's actually more around 6% headwind that we're seeing across all the various currencies.
Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then how does it net out at the EPS line, just, given some of the associated cost benefits, is it still a headwind on EPS?
Anthony J. Conte: Yes. It is a slight headwind on EPS or -- yes, on EPS depending on where share count ends up, obviously. But yes, it's a slight headwind still on EPS.
Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay, understood. And then, just if we look at the quarterly cadence of what you're expecting in terms of margins and expenses, I mean, at least relative to what the Street was modeling the Q1 EPS is lower, but, obviously the full year looks just fine. So is there any inordinate amount of expense, timing related in Q1, for example or how should we be thinking about quarterly progression of margins?
Anthony J. Conte: Yes. We had the same issue last year with the consensus. It kind of straight lines it a little bit more than our true trend. Q1 for us is a little bit of a squeezed quarter because revenue is typically flat-to-down, and we also put in place all our promotions and wage increases. So you end up with a little bit of a compression in Q1, that then, as customers really budget and revenue starts to grow throughout the year, you see the expansion again. So Q1's always a little bit of a squeeze. We had the same issue last year with consensus.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Plus we see holidays in Eastern Europe.
Anthony J. Conte: Right, yes. We have the orthodox holidays in Eastern Europe and that just brings revenue down, plus a lot of budget cycles are slow to pick up until Feb, March.
Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Right. Okay. And then just last one for me. If we just think about Ukraine specifically, and -- Ark, I know you spend lot of time in the region in general, can you just give us sort of the latest bird's-eye view on what is happening with the operations across Europe, half a dozen or so developments in the country? I know that none of them are especially close to where the bulk of the military conflicts have been occurring, but have you had to move any folks around, among those Ukraine centers or outside of Ukraine to Belarus or elsewhere?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, we didn't run special programs to relocate people on purpose from Ukraine to like Eastern Europe to Central Eastern Europe or any other locations. But we have internally, what we call mobility program, when people who would like to be relocated apply. And probably, inside of this program it was slightly higher number of people than usual. But based on the, kind of, day-to-day situation it's pretty normal, again, in line with what we have communicated during the last quarters. So yes, there is -- there are concerns and we don't know what could happen. There are still, but again, operations right now as usual and there is some movement of people, but again, it's not like in dramatically high numbers than before.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Anthony, as we look at the revenue growth for fiscal '15, could you help us break it down between headcount growth utilization and any pricing increments you're expecting in '15?
Anthony J. Conte: Sure. Headcount growth in '15 that we are assuming is going to be fairly in line with what we were looking at this past year, probably somewhere in the 20% range as far as growing organic headcount, could be a little bit lighter than that. And as far as bill rates, we're seeing a pretty consistent trend. We've always talked about 7%, 8% bill rates, it's coming in roughly around that same range. We're still, obviously, getting actuals in from our customers and seeing where things are going to fall in but that's what we're assuming at this point, is something that is with past years.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. So that would imply utilization basically remains flattish with where you've finished '14?
Anthony J. Conte: Yes. I mean, we finished out '14 at 77% so we expect utilization to remain right around that range, 77%, maybe 78%, but it's not going to get much higher than that.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then I wanted to get some color on your expectations for wage inflation in '15 and also, what are you seeing on the employee-attrition front in your various geographies?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So in general, we're expecting similar numbers historically. But clearly, wage inflation right now is a big factor of again, currency rates exchanges. So we are working on this and we -- like with the previous equations, we're looking what the trend's going to be. So at this point, we expect similar numbers like previous years.
Anthony J. Conte: So my model includes consistent figures of past years.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Which would be high-single digits, is that in the ballpark?
Anthony J. Conte: Yes.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Correct. For both of them.
Anthony J. Conte: Right.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. All for attrition and for rate inflation. Got it. And then one last question, just your comments around competition. Any new players out there you're seeing, what have your win rates been like, lately? Any change at the margin that you're seeing on the competitive side would be helpful.
Arkadiy Dobkin: You see, the market is so big and there are so many players that I don't think any specific 1 player will change the situation. And as we said before, in different segments of our markets, we compete with different players. So far we didn't see any significant changes, like maybe, the most interesting is still consolidation around like, Sapient become part of the agency right now together with the same [indiscernible] and that might be interesting impact on the some part of market we targeted -- targeting right now. So, but in general, I think we see very consistent [indiscernible] and competition.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: One question I had was, 2014, obviously, a year of transition, you took a lot of different steps to diversify and so on. You mentioned preparing for the next phase. How should the financial model look like in the next couple of years in terms of your ability to sustain a low 20s -- low- to mid-20s topline growth, the 16% to 18% margin, the ability to win maybe, larger contracts, things like that?
Arkadiy Dobkin: When you're asking how financial model should look like, what do you mean?
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I mean, will it be, one, now that you've made some of these investments, maybe if you go after larger contract, does that affect maybe your ability to grow faster? Is there a price to be paid in terms of operating profitability?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. I think we -- and it's very difficult to see over the -- and see what kind of impact will be happening with the next year. We're looking still like -- as today, we're giving guidance for the next year and we're looking to the market, because we clearly would like to, first of all, create a value to the clients, that would give us this growth which we hope in a 20-plus percentage. And how specifically it would impact our margins in longer, longer term, we don't know. Because, like what we're doing right now is something unusual for us, we're bringing in very different capabilities and really trying to integrate them and harmonize it across the company, which sometimes putting us in an unexpected kind of ground. That's why I don't think I can give you any more data than we're sharing right now. I think we hope that with these new capabilities and this like -- you're absolutely right, 2014 was a very interesting year for us when we brought different capabilities. But some of them, still, like when we -- when, for example, Anthony mentioned fully integrated, they kind of fully -- at good extent, integrated from the approaching clients. From integration and putting the team together, which is harmonized teams working to one goal and working very effectively together is still a lot of work. And as you understand, like some of these acquisition were done in the second part of the year, it's still a lot of work to be invested. And we're learning -- we're practically learning on the job how to do it better. And from this point of view, it's not stopped so it will be continued this year, and we still have a number of gaps in capabilities which we're going to bridge through additional small acquisitions or potentially through via organic growth. So I know I'm kind of giving you fuzzy answer but that's how we operate in many respects, because market is moving so fast that we trying to catch it up and be in line with demands, and the demand's changing.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: No, understood. And that's still pretty good color. One question about GGA, you mentioned the fair value adjustment, are there any more details? Is this -- and you did say it's behind you but I guess, the question's around the management team and the capabilities that came with GGA, do you still have those? I just want to make sure.
Anthony J. Conte: Yes, just -- I'll give you some color on the fair value adjustment. What it basically is, is it's tied to the earnout that we had at GGA. So as we closed the year out, their earnout ended on December 31. And they did better than we initially anticipated earlier in the year, and that $1.9 million is meant to reflect the incremental earnout that we will be giving them based on their final performance.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. So, okay, that's basically it. The Minsk building charge, and you mentioned this in the past, but I just want to make sure, does that affect operations in any way? I mean, presumably, the building was being constructed to house -- I mean to have employees in there. So is this affecting delivery, I mean, are there alternatives that you're working towards?
Anthony J. Conte: No. I mean, it doesn't affect delivery. I mean, before we started construction, we would rent space throughout Minsk. And really, what it has meant is we've had to continue to rent various facilities throughout Minsk to house our folks and the delay means that we just have a delay in being able to benefit from having our own building and putting everybody in 1 place. But it doesn't really affect operations at all.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So what's the outlook now? Are you still proceeding with the construction?
Anthony J. Conte: Yes. We have a target date of June to try and complete the building and move our folks in probably over the summer, if all goes according to plan.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And my last question is on the headcount. U.S. investment, Europe your target was 10%. You hit it. What's the next goal?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So it's still going to grow with, again, with the change in type of services which we provide and we still -- we're still going to grow. Right now, we kind of trying to understand exactly what areas it would be and also because potentially, we will be sealing the gaps with some small M&A transactions, which again might happen, might not. We probably will look in during the next couple of years to increase it by another 2%, 3%.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel.
Jyhhaw Liu - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: This is Irvin Liu calling in for David Grossman. Most of my questions have already been asked so just a modeling question. For 2015, could you walk us through the non-GAAP adjustments that's assuming guidance?
Anthony J. Conte: Sure. So the only non-GAAP adjustments that we really, actually, forecast are going to be a little bit of FX, P&L FX which we have modeled at about $2.5 million right now, which is really a very rough estimate but we wanted to put something as a placeholder. And stock compensation is estimated to be around $31 million for the year.
Jyhhaw Liu - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Got it. And what about amortization?
Anthony J. Conte: Amortization. Yes, I forgot amortization of intangibles, should be about $5.8 million.
Jyhhaw Liu - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And what about the drop off in D&A expense for the fourth quarter? How should we think about that going forward?
Anthony J. Conte: Sorry drop off in -- I'm sorry, I didn't hear. Drop off in what expense?
Jyhhaw Liu - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: D&A. Depreciation and amortization.
Anthony J. Conte: Depreciation and amortization. Yes, I'm sorry, it's primarily related to some amortization that really just came to conclusion in the third quarter. So it was fully amortized in Q3 and we didn't have anything else ramping up at that point, so we saw a drop in overall amortization. Non-acquisition amortization dropped.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Veytsman with Monness, Crespi.
Alexander Veytsman - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division: Just to follow-up on an earlier question, as your efforts continue to shift the labor force from Ukraine to Poland, Hungary, and given the wage differential between those markets, between Ukraine and [indiscernible] countries, are you baking -- are you baking in any bottom line impact from that into your 2015 guidance?
Arkadiy Dobkin: First of all, we didn't say that we shifting from Ukraine to Poland and Hungary. We're still growing in Ukraine. That's why I'm not sure that I -- we didn't say that we're doing anything specific to shift people from Ukraine.
Alexander Veytsman - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division: But are you growing the Polish and Hungarian markets? I mean are you...
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. We're growing, like, Hungarian market grows practically like we grew during the last couple of years. Poland growing faster, but it's much, much smaller -- smaller base.
Alexander Veytsman - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division: Got it. So...
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, clearly, we are taking this in account when we model in because we have different growth perspective for different countries and we have model based on this, so it's counted in the model based on what we see today. Again, if you look -- but it's practically adjusted on quarterly, if not even monthly, basis based on the necessity for staffing for specific opportunities, specific engagement and also some external factors. Because, while I'm saying that Ukraine's still growing, clearly, like 12 months ago, we were thinking that Ukraine would be growing faster than it's happened during the 2014. So it's very much adjustable but right now, it's based on the current plans for the year.
Alexander Veytsman - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, makes sense. And then I think at some point you cited that Ukraine's labor force is around maybe 28%, 29% of the labor force kind of in that range, and then Russia is maybe kind of about half of that 14%, 15%. Can you update us on those numbers, are those numbers still intact?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It's approximately like this, right?
Anthony J. Conte: Yes. Ukraine, Ukraine's probably in the low 20s now, because as we have grown elsewhere they're representing a low 20s. And Russia, after acquisition with GGA, probably somewhere around mid-teens.
Alexander Veytsman - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division: Well, okay. So Ukraine -- I mean, like, so it's low 20s now not because you downsized there but because you've increased the base in other markets?
Anthony J. Conte: More because we've seen growth in other locations, but they've continued to grow as well so it's just become diversified a bit. I mean, I just wanted to double check that Ukraine number, but I'm pretty sure...
Arkadiy Dobkin: Ukraine is high 20s and...
Anthony J. Conte: High 20s.
Arkadiy Dobkin: High 20s and Russia, it's around 14%, 15%.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen and Company.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Yes, just a brief follow up. Can we get an update on where we are in terms of the sales force headcount right now? Are we still continuing to expand that group? And then, maybe looking at the pipeline into 2015, is there anything different compared to last year or a few years ago in terms of the nature of the deals and maybe sizes of the deals?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, there's still -- I've also shared in the past, we're still hiring and -- hiring people for our business development function. Again, that's not a function where we have -- where we're planning to have hundreds of people, so it's still couple dozens people across locations. So -- but we had in and kind of optimizing this operation all the time. So we probably still double this number during the last year and also, don't forget that we inherited some number of people with the small -- with acquisitions, which becoming part of EPAM. So I think the total number was doubled but again, it's all couple of dozens, not hundreds. So from the pipeline point of view, it's gradually changing the type of projects, like, if -- in 2013, it was few of the kind of projects, where we were leading from consultant or digital strategy and in 2014, these number of projects increased, and we see a lot of things where we kind of leading the new commerce or complex web content engagements, which actually drive in additional mobile engagement or analytics engagement and have too many services engagements in those areas. So I think the proportion of this type of deal is increasing, probably in line with increased capabilities to do it and better integration between this new type of skills and traditional engineering skills you have.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: And are these larger deal sizes or kind of a lot of them, but maybe smaller?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So there are some of them, which looks smaller initially but, again, trigger in, trigger in more opportunities and more engagement like on the tail of this. So -- and some of them, pretty light. So we have couple very light engagement in this area last year and we see in the number of opportunities right now already.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Steven Milunovich with UBS.
Peter Christiansen - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: It's Peter again, I just have a quick follow-up. Firstly, I think you guys normally disclose at the end of the year, the number of accounts that you have and give us a sense of where that is for the full year?
Anthony J. Conte: Let's see. Accounts, we usually did accounts over $100,000 worth of business and that would be 306 accounts over $100,000 compared to 263 last year.
Peter Christiansen - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then what was constant-currency growth in the CIS region in the quarter?
Anthony J. Conte: Constant-currency growth in the CIS region?
Peter Christiansen - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes. I'm just trying to get a sense of how the volume was year-over-year irrespective of currency.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don't think it was given.
Anthony J. Conte: Yes, we never really break it up that finite. But if you're talking about, from a revenue perspective, ruble dropped -- let me see what the number is here...
Arkadiy Dobkin: Well, I think we can...
Anthony J. Conte: I don't really have it broken down by region. Sorry.
Arkadiy Dobkin: We can come back on this. But I would say the CIS region probably, didn't grow even in constant currency. Because CIS region was clearly hit by 2 factors, currency itself, but actually, the economic situation in the region, not great.
Anthony J. Conte: Right. Regions is down on both metrics, yes.
Arkadiy Dobkin: That's why we were pointing out that North America and Eastern Europe -- in European Union region, we're growing in pretty high numbers because Russia and -- or CIS was impacting us on both fronts.
Operator: Mr. Dobkin, there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back to you for any closing and final remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Again, thank you very much for joining us today, and we're really glad that we went through this difficult year with results, which we shared, and talk to you in 3 months. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful day.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-11-04 08:00:00) =====

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the EPAM Systems Third Quarter 2014 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Lilya Chernova. Thank you. You may begin.
Lilya Chernova: Thank you and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company’s third quarter 2014 results. If you have not a copy is available on our website at epam.com. The speakers on today’s call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Anthony Conte, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today’s call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company’s earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Arkadiy.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Lilya, and thanks to everyone on the call for your time today. Over the past quarters, we have accelerated on EPAM aggressive strategy to help customers run digital [ph]. In fact, we were focusing very strongly on how we’re to address the growing clients’ needs triggered by new digitally destructive business model they have to implement to stay competitive. To achieve that, we’ll continue to invest in critical for our digital skills and technology capabilities as well as very specific industries per se [ph]. This has been made possible by unique combination of investments we made and continue making both organically and inorganically since our IPO in 2012. In the third quarter, the momentum continued. EPAM had a very possible third quarter result as we delivered it through and creating of 182.8 million doors or 7.5% growth year over year and 10% growth over our Q2 results. Partially, it attributes to our three previous acquisition which we are further integrating into EPAM during the last month when they turn in their first full quarter with EPAM. While on acquisitions, I would mention that just last week, we closed another important deal for us that formed this strong service design capabilities called Great Fridays. We’ll talk more about it later today. At the same time, you already might believe that our growth is a very organic nature, which we carefully complemented additional specific skills and capabilities by adding very selectively to our strong core, skills and software product engineers. In result, our overall growth during the last couple of years were driven by growing customer demand and now increasingly have the set of skills, capabilities, experiences and our overall abilities to engage and deliver complete software solution. And we do believe our customers recognize this unique value which have been much more now. So before I turn things over to Anthony to go over further details on our Q3 financial performance, I would like to reiterate the statements I made by [ph] number of recognitions we received in Q3. I think they will provide a good sort of independent confirmation which further support our overall strategy and also help to demonstrate the progress ratio in moving forward to the direction. So first of all, our product engineer capability. As referred during our previous call, we do believe that our accreditation software product engineering gives us many advantages into the market, when software product development skill become important not only for traditional software industry but for many other industries are forced to rely in software to implement varied new business model. As we said before, there’s a plan to maintain very strong core skill set in software engineering to support and develop our focus, knowledge and skill to understand new emerging technologies better and to know firsthand what is happening in the enterprise software market. It’s important for us not only because it’s sizable customer market segment for us. It’s a key differential expertise critically important for our new clients in this new software-driven segment. So we do leverage today over 20 years of engineer hands on experience to develop an awaited software available [ph] brand and enable our clients and digitally discuss between us [ph] to continue to stay ahead of the competition. So in addition to the recent product [indiscernible] or product development services where EPAM was first in leadership position, it was very good to see that EPAM was recognizing this quarter as one of the leaders in two software project development vertical – Enterprise Software and Consumer Software by Zinnov. Zinnov is a managing consultant firm focusing on primarily on further development market research and publish this global R&D service provider [indiscernible]. Now on our commerce capability. We utilize our engineering skill set at its own penetration point. But to bring real value to our new clients, we need to do much more. So today, EPAM more and more in the position of leading net generation customer engagement serving the customer on any device in any channel, it’s multi-vendor, omni-channel, eCommerce platforms. Today’s platforms include leading enterprise software such as SAP, fabris [ph], Oracle, ATG, [indiscernible] and extend to open source fourth quarter [ph] and to completely custom development efforts as well. Very often, growth are combined with our growing capabilities in big data analytics and cloud. So in confirmation of last month, EPAM has been included in the list of the top 10 largest software service providers in [indiscernible] September 2015. Corner service providers market overview large scale partners can accelerate corners for key customers [indiscernible]. The report reviews over 110 responses from representatives at both [indiscernible] and specialty corner service providers company and the details the eCommerce platform, geographies and industry vertical as the largest provider support. Another interesting illustration of the same point is EPAM’s win of Liberty Global Best Product and Service Quality Award. The [indiscernible] award and the seventh annual Technology Summit and won dozens of events. In addition, EPAM was shortlisted in the top 3 for the Best Innovator category. I would mention that Liberty Global is the largest cable company in the world today. The winners of the Liberty Global Technology Award were selected by the input from [indiscernible] senior executive across the entire company. This recognition, the technologies relationship [ph] with EPAM [indiscernible] of development and innovation across Liberty Global [indiscernible]. And in result, Liberty Global was able to source and refine ideas in response to real business challenges by taking in the collective creativity of EPAM employees and encourage them to submit ideas in a way together with Liberty Global. In our opinion, this win continues to validate our standards for the [indiscernible] to EPAM clients. Now on big data and analytic capabilities. During this quarter, EPAM was included in the shortlist of companies considered for the implementation of Consolidated Audit Trail or CAT, a system for the Securities and Exchange Commission can be development in the response on circ rule 613 adopted in July 2012. The CAT is one of the biggest undertakings in the history of Securities [indiscernible]. It can go record in 25 [indiscernible] transaction data in the next five years. And it’s second only to national security agencies data [indiscernible]. Over 3,000 organizations [indiscernible] the transaction data. The [indiscernible] process more than 50 billion [indiscernible] resulting in approximately 10 terabytes of data per day and the number is expected to grow 25% a year. EPAM [indiscernible] that were selected from the list of 31 initial recognition including all major companies in the field including IBM, Google, Computer Science Corporation and others. The decision of each company to get the contract will come next year. But we consider it as a success and confirmation of our expertise in big data and the capital market allowing us to come up with a very competent portfolio [ph]. EPAM was shortlisted among six top vendors together with FINRA, SunGard, Computer Science Corporation and HP. And it put us in the late category of vendors able to help find an answer to what is one of the today’s biggest challenges in the financial services industry [ph]. Now on digital strategy capabilities and the recent announcement of Great Fridays acquisition. Customer experience has become a great focus for EPAM as we work to differentiate our offering in the marketplaces. In 2012, we acquired Empathy Lab, the digital strategy and experience design [indiscernible] to add and enhance capabilities to EPAM [indiscernible] development skill set. And we know now it makes a very important impact on EPAM overall capabilities. Last week, EPAM acquired Great Fridays, a product and services design corp. Headquartered in Manchester, Ukraine with studios in London and San Francisco and New York, Great Fridays is focused on bridging the gap between business and design. So with design-focused [indiscernible] Great Fridays help companies such as Sonos, Pearson, MasterCard and Vodafone create not only beautiful products and services, but also smart new business practices that deliver lasting commercial value and business transformation. Great Fridays’ success brings [indiscernible] in business and design combined with Empathy Lab around digital strategy and experience design and then supports EPAM’s [indiscernible] for the development and [indiscernible] capabilities should allow us to create an end to end solution for those customers looking to build their [indiscernible] digital customer experiences. And we are very excited to have Great Fridays’ capabilities to the EPAM family and see the common result. To conclude, I would report to our most recent recognition coming from [indiscernible]. Each year [indiscernible] strong, consistent growth in a feature on America’s Best Small Companies or public companies under $1 billion in revenue. Thirty-sixth annual [indiscernible] to home building to retail. [Indiscernible] on equities, sales growth and earnings growth over the last 12 months as well as past last year. They also partner it in stock markets or common [indiscernible] of each company tier group during the past year. So this year, [indiscernible] number three overall and number one for technology companies on America’s Best Small Companies list. And underscoring EPAM ability to continue to grow and change. This recognition provides kind of integral mark to our overall direction especially taken into account with regards on the list for the second [indiscernible]. Last year, EPAM was number six and two accordingly. Now, over to Anthony for more details on Q3 financial performance.
Anthony Conte: Thank you, Ark, and good morning everyone. I’m going to spend a few minutes taking you through the third quarter results then I’ll talk more about our fourth quarter and full year outlook. As usual, the whole details of our results can be found in our press release and the quarterly fact sheet located on the investor section of our website. As detailed in our press release, the third quarter revenues grew 37.5% over last year and 10.3% sequentially to $192.8 million above the top end of our guidance. North America remains our largest segment representing 50.7% of our revenue, up 35.8% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. Europe was up 42% year-over-year and 5.5% sequentially now representing 37.5% of revenue. CIS was up 1% year-over-year and 2.7% sequentially representing only 7.9% of revenue. Looking at service lines, we’ve experienced no significant change in our revenue mix. Software development and application testing services continue to our largest service offering, representing approximately 69% and 20% of revenue respectively. Our top 20 accounts came in at 55.3% of revenue, growing 31.8%. While all our other clients below top 20 grew 46.6% year-over-year. Each of our verticals grew year-over-year and sequentially led by Travel and Consumer and the other vertical. Travel and Consumer increased 52.1% from prior year and 18% sequentially representing 22.2% of our Q3 revenues, the large sequential growth was related to completion of some key milestone for several large accounts and the quick ramp up for a new opportunity that started in Q2. The other vertical grew 61% year-over-year and 15% sequentially primarily due to the GGA [ph] acquisition and represent 13% of Q3 revenues. GAAP income from operations increased 7.9% year-over-year to represent 11.3% of revenue. Included in our operating results in a GAAP basis are stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, acquisition-related costs and certain other onetime items that we excluded from our non-GAAP measures. Full details on these can be found in our press release. Stock-based compensation expense increased around 26% sequentially in Q3 as a result of the first full quarter of expense for stock granted as part of the acquisitions in the first half of the year. After these adjustments, our non-GAAP income from operation increased 33.2% over prior year to $31.8 million representing 15.5% of revenue. GAAP net income increased 15.8% year-over-year and non-GAAP net income grew 43% year-over-year. Net income for the quarter was boosted by a lower than normal tax rate of approximately 15%. This was due to a onetime reversal of reserve for an uncertain tax position set up in 2010. Our 2010 tax returns filed timely in September 2011 included the uncertain tax position form that properly explains the position issue to the IRS. The IRS statute of limitation is now expired. And the 2010 tax return in total has expired from statute. For the quarter, we generated $0.50 of non-GAAP EPS, also above the top end of our guidance, and $0.38 GAAP EPS based on approximately 49.8 million diluted shares outstanding. The overperformance in EPS is due to several factors. Almost $3 million of revenue overperformance contributed about $0.03 to the bottom line. The tax reserve reversal was worth approximately another $0.02. On a GAAP basis, we also had about a $0.04 overperformance due to an error in our estimate related to stock compensation expense from the acquisitions. We completed the quarter with 11,509 IT professionals, an increase of approximately 26% compared to Q3 of 2013 and 4% sequentially. Approximately 9% of this growth is from acquisitions, bringing organic headcount growth to about 17%. Utilization for the quarter was at 73.8%, about 3% lower than Q2, primarily due to the heavy vacation months of July and August, combined with some ramp up in hiring in some new locations like Poland. Now, turning to our balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $191 million of cash, up $16 million from June 30th and $22 million from December 31st. During the third quarter, operating activities generated approximately $16.2 million of cash. Unbilled revenues were at $71 million as of September 30th, an increase of about $3 million compared to Q2. This sequential increase is normal as our fixed-price projects grow throughout the year and then expire in the fourth quarter. As a percentage of revenue, however, this is still much lower than Q3 of 2013. Accounts receivables were at $114 million at the end of Q3 and DSO ended the quarter at approximately 54 days. Turning to our guidance. For the full year 2014 based on current conditions and including the impact of all acquisitions, EPAM expects revenue growth to be $728 million to $730 million. Non-GAAP net income growth for 2014 is expected to be in the range of 33% to 35% year-over-year with an effective tax rate of 19%. The full year weighted average share count is expected to be just under 50 million diluted shares outstanding. For the fourth quarter of 2014, EPAM expects revenues between $200 million and $202 million, representing a growth rate of 27% to 28% over fourth quarter 2013 revenue. Fourth quarter of 2014 non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.59 to $0.61 based on an estimated third quarter weighted average shares outstanding of 50 million. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.38. I would now like to turn the call back to the operator and open up for Q&A. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company: Hey, thanks, good morning. Can you talk a bit about gross and operating margin trends in the quarter, the pluses and minuses that kind of shows us what happened year-over-year in terms of comps?
Anthony Conte: Hi, Moshe. It’s Anthony here. Any particular trend that you’re looking at in specific or just –
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company: So I think your margins were down year-over-year, so I wanted to kind of understand what happened there and then the same thing for operating margins, GAAP and then adjusted. Thanks.
Anthony Conte: Well, the operating margins, again, we continue to put money into the business. We’re working on a variety of investments. The top line growth is coming in ahead of where we expected both from an organic and from an acquisition perspective, so we’ve been having to continue to spend into the business in a variety of areas to continue to shore up the infrastructure to make sure we can continue to support the growth that we’re seeing on the top line. That’s had some impact on the operating margins and kept them pretty much flat to Q2 and a little bit down from last year. And it’s a lot of the same areas where we’ve talked in the past, bringing in some domain expertise, focusing on the sales function. I mean we just continue to spend in those particular areas and that’s keeping the operating margins where they are. Gross margins, they are down about 0.4%. It’s a little bit lower due to heavier vacations in the July and August cycle, so that’s going to cause a little bit of a drop in the gross margin combined with some additional wage inflation that we saw in our midyear raises. There’s really nothing more than those two components playing on the gross margin component.
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company: Okay. And then was there any FX contribution to the margins as well?
Anthony Conte: A little bit. There was a small impact at the gross margin level. And at the bottom line net income level, it was a little bit over $1 million of positive impacts once you factor in the negative revenue impact offset by obviously a positive pick up on the expense side. So it’s about $1 million on the bottom line.
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company: Okay. And then final question. I saw a spike in the contribution from a top client. I think you’re at 14%. Can you talk a bit about that? Just remind us, are we working with various different departments within that client and what are you doing there?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, Moshe, we’re working with multiple groups, in fact, of this account in multiple geographies. It’s actually very much global accounts and coming fast not just Europe and not just to North America but to also now Asia, China, Singapore including. And again, it’s very, very diverse effort for us right now.
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company: Understood, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Steve Milunovich – UBS: Thank you, good morning. So your fourth quarter revenue guidance obviously suggests a deceleration into the high 20s in revenue growth. Is there anything in particular driving that? Is that conservatism or I know on the fourth quarter sometimes you have some significant swing factors?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, for the last couple of years we’ve had some revenue issue, yes. A little bit a surprise to us and usually it was coming from CIS region. With everything that was happening in this quarter, the world [ph], as you know, during this year we don’t expect any jumps in Q4. And on top of this, as you know, the ruble and majority of our revenue coming in local currencies for us definitely getting weaker and weaker. And just on total shares revenue, if you take into account foreign exchange, it’s a big amount kind of going down. So that’s why Q4 looks as it looks. If you take out, for example, CIS revenue, then our gross increase will be practically in line with what you saw previously as well.
Steve Milunovich – UBS: Okay. Anthony, given the ruble then hits you at the revenue line, but are you likely to see a positive to the EPS line as you did this quarter?
Anthony Conte: Yes, there will definitely be some positive impacts on the bottom line as things swing. But we look at things in group currencies as well, so we have to really see where everybody goes in the fourth quarter and see how that falls out. But, yes, it should in theory give us a little bit of an uplift on the EPS number.
Arkadiy Dobkin: But please don’t – do remember that our cost in rubles only in Russia. So it’s not like embarking [ph] for example anything [ph] in Belarus or Ukraine. So it’s only Russia based.
Anthony Conte: And I would say that our estimate, our EPS estimate includes that potential impact. So we’ve based that into both the top line revenue numbers and the EPS numbers. We’ve already adjusted based on where we’re seeing the ruble go.
Steve Milunovich – UBS: Understood. And can you bring us up-to-date in terms of your clients’ view of the situation in Ukraine, whether that’s having any impact on your pipeline and so forth?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Quite a few or a majority of the clients you actually driven by what’s happening kind of in the media and probably you see that media is pretty – look, relatively quiet if you compare this with what we saw six months or kind of nine months ago, eight months ago. So I think people kind of working in assumption that it would be settled and that’s what we’re seeing as well. With some escalations climbing kind of up and down, situation definitely much more stable than we were seeing this – in the middle of the summer, for example, or at the beginning of spring. So I think most of the client actually pretty accurate and pretty normal moderate comp [ph].
Steve Milunovich – UBS: And then finally, who are you competing against in new client deals? Is it Luxoft primarily or is it more the larger service companies?
Arkadiy Dobkin: We don’t compete much with Luxoft. We maybe compete from time to time in financial sector but even there like with exception of shared accounts, we don’t see each other much. The second besides financial sectors, you know that we have a little bit different strategy and we mostly focus on kind of digital change. And we’re competing with people like Sapient or some specific companies focusing on eCommerce and digital marketing type of applications. We also compete in big accounts with major players including IBM and Infosys and Cognizant and others as well and some special focused division [ph] for them.
Steve Milunovich – UBS: Okay, thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Thank you, good morning. I may have missed a couple of the quick data points, so if I could just start there. Could you just review what the organic growth was both year-over-year and sequentially?
Anthony Conte: Sure. How are you, David? It’s Anthony here. Q3 organic was around 27% and sequentially, we were coming in at about 6% organic.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, great. And I think you did mention utilization, Anthony. I missed it. What was it in the quarter?
Anthony Conte: 74%.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And is that pretty much consistent with the first half?
Anthony Conte: No, it’s down. Q3 is a heavy vacation cycle, so July and August a lot of people are out, so utilization dropped. It is consistent with where we were Q3 of last year given last December.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Right, got it. And then, I wonder if I could go back to a question that was asked a little bit earlier. It looks like the growth in your top client was pretty robust and maybe this is a manifestation of just a couple of other clients. But when you look at the top five and the top – most of that growth came from that one client, is there some attrition in some of the top five or the top 10 that’s really masking that so that the others are actually in fact growing much faster or is that just the way the quarter rolled out where one client pretty much accounted for the vast majority of the growth?
Anthony Conte: Well, a lot of the – I mean, when we did the acquisition of Jointech, that brought revenue from that same large client. So what you have is the first full quarter of revenue from Jointech. And so that’s why you’re seeing the pop in that one client for this particular quarter.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, got it. And then in terms of – I think Arkadiy talked about how important the digital marketing and commerce segment is to you. Can you help us size just how big that is within EPAM when you include the recent acquisition of Great Fridays?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Great Fridays is a small, very specialized acquisition, so I don’t think it’s embarking anything [ph] in numbers. But the sizing of this, it’s very difficult calculation because it depends what you’re counting in [ph]. And commerce, it’s a broad term. So what I can say that it’s probably very – it is a very fast growing market and if you talking about strictly eCommerce implementation of things like Hybris or ATG, then it’s tens and tens of millions. If you’re looking at this broad and include in digital strategy part of the business and mobile extensions and analytics and actually of course it’s including like logistical piece for retail, then it will be for us in hundreds of millions already.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And then just finally, with the recent acquisition activity and just bundling everything together, Anthony, can you give us a sense for what the stock-based comp and the amortization should look like going forward?
Anthony Conte: Absolutely. The stock-based comps – and we haven’t finalized the purchase accounting and everything for Great Fridays, as we disclosed last week, but there are some estimate in my numbers related to that one. But I would expect Q4 stock compensation to be approximately $7.6 million. And from an amortization of intangibles, it should be about $2.8 million is what I’m currently estimating.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And that’s just the partial quarter, right, for Great Fridays?
Anthony Conte: Correct. Yes, it will only be two months for the Great Fridays piece.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, great.
Anthony Conte: So then I would say if you want a more kind of a full quarter view, probably be about $7.8 million on the stock comp full quarter view and add maybe another 200 [ph] to amortization of intangibles, so about $3 million.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, great. Thank you.
Anthony Conte: Yes.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: Thank you. Good morning, Ark; good morning, Anthony.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Good morning.
Anthony Conte: Good morning.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: So good quarter here. I guess there’s not much doubt in my mind about the demand profile you guys are seeing and our checks show the same thing. My question is more on the people side, the supply side of the equation. Could you talk a little bit about your headcount growth strategy? Some of the areas you’re moving into requires slightly different kind of talent potentially, where are you finding that talent, is it challenging, things like that, could you address those types of questions?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, sure. Yes, I know like when we were talking last year it was where some concerns about our speed incurring [ph] and we had many questions on [ph] some of this and usually our answer was that in 2012 we built a pretty significant range last Thomson Reuters kind of impact and we didn’t need to hire as many people as before, proportionate to the growth rates. And that exactly was kind of the reason why our – had increased [ph] down a little bit in the past year. I think this year we actually – we’re up to speed. And the current company [ph] still mostly in the same regions where we did before in Eastern Europe and Hungary. We’re also starting to grow much faster and aggressively in Poland. We just recently opened development center in Bulgaria, so we will be growing there. As you know, China now in the map and it’s still kind of in a lot of integration efforts happening and we kind of learning a lot. But it would be growth area for the next year for us at least and we’re planning for this. So I think the picture didn’t change much from the last years. When you’re asking if it’s easy or hard, yes, it’s not easy and I also was commenting all the time that the talented people in demand all was replaced [ph] from San Francisco to New York to London and to Minsk, Belarus. So from this point of view, no, not much changes. But we’re working as we did and that big portion part of our investments come into relationship within newer cities across all Former Soviet Union and our development centers both in Hungary and Poland and so for internal trainings as well. So I don’t think I told you something new, but that’s what it is.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: Okay. No, it’s good to get the update. One question I did have as I look at some of the metrics you provided, Russia seemed to pop up in terms of headcount increase. I’m not sure that’s Russia itself or is there a lumping maybe a few countries, is it Russia and –
Arkadiy Dobkin: No, this is mostly GGA. GGA had a couple of thousand people in Russia and you see basically in part of this.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: Okay, got it, got it. The other question that I had was with regards to – as you get deeper into digital marketing and areas like that, are you seeing maybe an increased volatility of the projects that – lower visibility of projects or do you still have the historical level of visibility into your revenues?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I do believe in general on the level of company. We have very, very similar visibility as we did in the past. There are definitely changes because the digital driven projects, we starting sometimes relatively small on this pilot. But we trying to carefully select opportunities where we have kind of upside and repeated business. And so far we have proved that it could bring us significant tens of millions business over the next several years. This client was started small and then expanded in different areas, different branch, different channels as well. So I think it’s working well. But there are some projects, small ones as well which we getting in with completely organized because we would like to test ourselves and test new technologies and be able to have good friendzone [ph] experience before we applying this to big opportunities. But it is very much in line with our history of working with sometimes small startup and independents like these small software product companies where we try to understand what’s happening in technology and kind of emerging trends. So there is not much new, it’s just a little bit different sector for us.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: Got it, understood. Thank you, guys. Good quarter. And Ark, I have to say congratulations on being named to the Forbes All-Star list.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Ashwin.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: Yes, okay.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Mayank Tandon – Needham & Company: Thank you. Good morning. Anthony, I don’t know if you talked about pricing trends. If you could just touch on how much of the growth is coming from pricing, I know you had a lot of increases last year, almost double-digit. Maybe give us some perspective on that. And also, Ark, I wanted to ask you about the sales productivity, I know you’ve invested aggressively in sales. Maybe just give us some sense of the trends there and how do you expect to position yourself for ‘15 on that front as well. Do we expect more investments or do you feel like you’ve done as much as you can now or you want to start to see it pay off before you start to invest more aggressively on the sales front?
Anthony Conte: Hi, Mayank. It’s Anthony. I’ll tackle the first one and let Ark jump in. As far as pricing trends, there’s really no difference at this stage of the year. I mean we’re still looking at kind of that 6%, 7%, 8% blended price increases that we’ve talked about through most of the year. Most of that pricing will happen. As we move into the new year, we’ll get a better picture on where pricing is going for 2015 in Q1. But at this stage, we’re not seeing any change from what we see in the balance of this year.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, and in regards to our kind of sales marketing field [ph] operation, so yes, we’re investing a lot and we have onboard new people. And we’re also slowly doing exactly what we were planning to do and what we already talked about since IPO change and profile with the company and awaiting profile and kind of follow brand for this digital market and eCommerce type of profile. So working more and able to get in the doors not only to IT people or IT budget, but now business budget and to marketing budget. This is all happening. If you’re asking [indiscernible] that now we will see very clearly [indiscernible] last month, that’s probably would be much more conservative. I think it’s kind of non-stop effort. And we do that we’re very much in the beginning of this effort still and we still need to elevate profiling even high and we should be able to do it with good number of successes and that’s what I was trying to explain and kind of illustrate this morning actually. But no, we’re not stopping this. It’s continuous and I think it would be continuing for a long time.
Mayank Tandon – Needham & Company: Okay. And I appreciate the color. And then I just wanted to ask you on the M&A strategy. I know you’ve done a few acquisitions, but as you look ahead in terms of balancing areas that you want to acquire, and is it more delivery expansion, to diversify or are there other capabilities, verticals or services that you want to enter into just based on demand from your clients. Maybe just give us some perspective on that as well, please.
Arkadiy Dobkin: It’s more on the second part of what you mentioned. And you see, we don’t have the strategy kind of to build EPAM through acquisitions. We don’t have any type of robust strategy and we never had. And if you look at our historical kind of speed of acquisitions, we did two write-off type PUR [ph], relatively small but very specific one from the point of building much stronger front operation for EPAM in Canada and another was important for us to the fourth kind of new digital strategy capability acquisition. And then given the 2013, we didn’t do any because we didn’t find anything interesting from this point of view. And it seems like we did many of them in 2014 and yes, we did. But again most of them, pretty small from revenue perspective, but very specific on the skill set or industry-focus or kind of like Great Fridays, expand and extend in what we’re already starting to do and what seemed really important for us. So again, that’s going to be our strategy in the future, though. I’m not saying that is isn’t something much, much strategically good for EPAM, but that’s not a focus for us. We’re kind of looking for opportunities to improve our muscles and different parts of our organization and to put it on voices [ph] of our software engineering skill set, we should be able to last [indiscernible] as we’re repeating all the time.
Mayank Tandon – Needham & Company: Right. Thank you. And then last question for me is on the hiring front. In terms of the hiring numbers, I think you had mid-20s growth the last couple of quarters. Obviously, that’s queued by acquisitions. Could you give us what your organic increase in headcount was and also maybe comment on the attrition trend that you’re seeing your various markets – employee attrition.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think actually Anthony mentioned very precisely exactly organic growth in headcount and the growth including acquisition.
Anthony Conte: Yes.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it was 26 and 17.
Anthony Conte: 19 actually. I think I’ve misspoken my script. It’s actually 19 is organic.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay.
Anthony Conte: And 26 in total.
Mayank Tandon – Needham & Company: Okay. Then on the attrition side, any changes that you’ve noticed in your various markets?
Anthony Conte: No, it’s still in the low teens.
Mayank Tandon – Needham & Company: Great. Good job, guys. Thank you.
Anthony Conte: Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Alex.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Bateman [ph] with Mona Christy [ph]. Please proceed with your question.
Alex Bateman – Mona Christy: Yes. Hi, guys. I just wanted to ask you if you’re seeing any impact from the sanctions. They’re still of course very much present in Russia. And also, given the overall and a western sentiment there, if that’s impacting your role as a U.S.-based company.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Nothing impacting us a U.S.-based company. So from the sanction point of view, there is no any direct impact. But as I mentioned, probably sanction did some impact on Russian economy and affects situation in Russia and that’s clearly making some impact. And again, negative and positive simultaneously. And I think Anthony was kind of addressing this already. But there is no any direct impact. There is no sanctions in EPAM doing business anywhere. So zero on this. And again, just general economic impact.
Alex Bateman – Mona Christy: Got, got it. And I think your number of employees in Russia stood around 1,200, 1,300, I mean do you intend to decrease it longer term? I mean I guess kind of where are you now and kind of what are the plans for the next year or two as far as labor location if any?
Arkadiy Dobkin: No, there is no specific labor relocation trends. So there is clearly very specific actions where we grow in and how fast. And Russia wasn’t growing or practically was flat from headcount point of view. But again, there is no relocation strategy. I think we would be able to bring in projects there. And again, the increase in Russia happened this year mostly due to acquisition of GGA.
Alex Bateman – Mona Christy: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Mr. Dobkin, we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you and thank you everybody for joining us today. I hope we addressed your questions, and looking forward to talk again in three months. Thank you everybody.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

===== 2014 Q2  (2014-08-05 23:00:00) =====
Executives: Lilya Chernova – IR Arkadiy Dobkin – President & CEO Anthony Conte – CFO
Analysts: Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company Darrin Peller – Barclays Capital David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup 
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the EPAM Systems second-quarter 2014 results conference call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Lilya Chernova. Thank you. Ms. Chernova, you may begin.
Lilya Chernova: Thank you and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the Company's second-quarter 2014 results. If you have not a copy is available on our website, www.EPAM.com. The speakers on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, Chief Executive Officer, and Anthony Conte, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Arkadiy.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I am very pleased to report that our second quarter, excluding any impacts from GGA acquisition proved to be another strong quarter for EPAM exceeding both guidance and consensus. Our second-quarter revenue was $174.7 million, a sequential increase of 9% and 31% year over year. Included in this figure is $2.4 million from the GGA acquisition that was not in our guidance. Non-GAAP net income was up almost 34% year over year and non-GAAP operating margin was in the range of 16.5%. Anthony will review the quarterly results in more details a bit later and provide you our guidance for Q3 and for the full year. At this point I would like to bring additional highlights on several important topics to continue explaining EPAM's overall challenges and opportunities in the market we serve and in the markets we operate. It will include the story around the latest CMO-CIO study we just released, some details on the GGA acquisition and an update on the Ukraine and Russian situation. During the last couple of calls we spent some time talking about EPAM's history and our strong software product engineering [inaudible]. We also touched on our [inaudible] evolution to solution provider to service a very fast developing subset of [inaudible] global market which consists in its majority from the companies never considered themselves as traditional software enterprises. At the same time during the recent year those companies were forced to change and to change very fast because their business model and their primary brands were starting to be impacted very rapidly by software. As a result they have been in search of very different technology providers capable in helping them to compete in the new software dependency areas. We also talked about the challenging set of hybrid skills needed to successfully serve that market and about specific reasons why EPAM might be one of the best to fill such needs. Finally, during our last call we [inaudible] with Forrester, a leading independent research analyst firm. Recognize EPAM is a leader in the emerging market, they named as a software for the development services 40 years. Forrester also identified several key vertical industries [inaudible] to their majority of such services. Those key industries include financial services, information services, detail [inaudible] and media and entertainment. For many years in the past our work put us in front of technologies, the CTOs and CIOs of the companies, very similar to who we dealt with when working with their independent software programmers. Now with a key focus on the verticals mentioned above the conversation as shifted to include the business and market insight of these enterprises. We are now talking to the CMOs and business leads in addition to the CIOs to understand both worlds better and to help them in developing their digital product strategy. At the same time, however, the responsibility for digital product development is not always clear and brings new challenges that we need to address to be successful. So EPAM decided to partner with CIO magazine and the CMO cloud to conduct a study looking deeper into CIO and CMO relationships and how companies are handling their only channel presence and digital strategy. The study was published just last week and surveyed over 400 CMOs and CIOs. It is available for download from our website and we encourage you to get a copy. So let me take you over some key points. First, the study showed that the reason this communication between CIO and CMO – digital product platform [inaudible] and only channel all have different meanings depending on if you speak with a CIO or CMO. This breakdown or miscommunication makes it very difficult to move forward with an aggressive digital strategy. The second key point was a technology finding is creating attack of war between the CIO and CMO. Even as their overall technology budgets have broadened, the allocation of the spend is shifting. Markets and budgets are becoming more linked to technology. Cloud-based digital marketing software, customer analytics and social media technologies to name a few force the CMO to involve the CIO on more market oriented projects. The third key point is that mobile has become the absolute flashpoint for [inaudible] channel. The study found that both CIO and CMO are using sales with all new the mobile strategy. While it sounds good, it can quickly become a negative if they don't have a collaborative approach. This brings us back to the first key point, and again highlighting the importance of vertical coordination between these 2 critical roles. The [inaudible] become more challenging. This in turn makes it even more difficult to succeed for suppliers that are not prepared to deal with it. After all, CMO has [inaudible] working with agency as well as CIO focus has been the system integrator traditionally. These are 2 different worlds. So to deal with that a new breed of partners should emerge who can breach this relationship and can help companies with their digital strategy that heavily depend on the disruptive technologies and new operational models to be delivered properly. Interesting to note that the same [inaudible] problem becoming the critical issue within vendor's multi-functional organizations. This actually multiplies the challenges for providers that have to deal not only with external but also with internal complications. What does this mean for EPAM and other providers? In short many providers struggle to find the right balance for digital customer centric product oriented strategy to execute today. That is exactly the challenge to overcome and the opportunity to [inaudible] for EPAM. To do so we are focused on leveraging our software for the development capabilities and as seamlessly as possible merging it with digital and specific vertical expertise as it was highlighted in the Forrester [inaudible]. That also explains the key focus area for our investments to bring the necessary [inaudible], both by our organic and not organic efforts. Finally, to better align these mentioned efforts, we are in the middle of a project to evolve our brand so that it reflects the significant growth in both breadth and depth of our capabilities. And our readiness to help these companies to bring to life their long-term digital service. GGA – it drew the close third acquisition this year of GGA. GGA is a US-based provider of scientific informatics services to global pharmaceutical, scientific instrumentation, medical device, scientific publishing and software and early-stage life science companies. The acquisition has a lot of potential by combining EPAM's more traditional software development capabilities with GGA's algorithmic development, mathematical modeling and sophisticated content database development capabilities. While initially the focus will be to develop this into Life Sciences solutions practice within EPAM the acquired capabilities could have broader application across our [inaudible]. GGA brings us over 500 employees, most in St. Petersburg, Russia, with over 20 people in US and Western Europe. Their client base includes 8 of the top 10 largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. This acquisition is right in line with our strategy of bringing on capabilities that help us to penetrate new verticals and to develop new [inaudible]. We believe that Life Sciences is among the industries which are disrupted by the same trends as industries we talked before. Therefore it is opening some potential for us to combine the power of GGA, their main expertise with existing EPAM capabilities and to grow this vertical into significant business over the next several years. Finally, before I turn it over to Anthony for the financial review let me update you on the Ukraine and Russia – Russian sanction situation. All EPAM locations continue to operate normally today. [inaudible] report over the past several months doesn't show any deviation from normal attendance rate in the offices in the region. Additionally, non-Ukrainian engagement in EPAM delivery [inaudible] in other countries were impacted. Neither EPAM nor any of EPAM clients have initiated disaster recovery or started to execute business continue to program steps. It is worth noting that majority of large client engagements are delivered from multiple locations and therefore have limited exposure to Ukraine. In those cases where a team's assembled source from Ukraine steps were taken to increase readiness for relocation should situation deteriorate significantly. EPAM hired over 400 IT professionals in the first 7 months of 2014 in Ukraine. This reflects our commitment [inaudible] from the vast majority of clients and staff. Additionally, EPAM brought over 100 university graduates into training and dozens of non-billable administrative and support staff. Sanctions against Russian government and government control interest don't affect EPAM. Extended sanctions target Russian government and government controlled interest and don't concern EPAM as a US-based Company. Russian activity in Western Ukraine has not disrupted EPAM's operations. EPAM has 2 offices in the east of the country Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk. Most of the associates are over 100 miles away and have no experience in any disruption. The situation in Eastern Ukraine continues to change on a daily basis and EPAM continues to monitor it closely. Ukraine mobilization doesn't have material impact on EPAM. Ukraine has and always had compulsory military service. This means that a good fraction of young men need to go through military training or service unless they are not eligible for health, family or work-related reasons. Daily report on attendance mentioned above includes absence due to participation in this type of activities and, as mentioned above, doesn't show deviation from historical averages. Need to separate real versus perceived risks. Given EPAM locations and the information shared, we are in position as of today of dealing with perceived risk. And this is what we explain to our customers on a regular basis. As you can see from our financial results and the facts we have shared, we have not felt any significant impact from the crisis and don't have real risk assuming the situation doesn't escalate. Now I will turn it over to Anthony to review the quarter in more details.
Anthony Conte: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to spend a few minutes taking you through the second-quarter results, then I will talk more about our Q3 and full-year outlook. As usual the full details of our results can be found in our press release and the quarterly fact sheet located on the Investors section of our website. As detailed in our press release, the second-quarter revenue grew 31.2% over last year and 8.9% sequentially to $174.7 million, above top end of our guidance. This includes $2.4 million from the GGA acquisition completed in early June and $2.3 million of over performance driven by continued strength in North America and Europe. North America remains our largest segment representing 49.6% of revenue, up 27% year over year and 9.4% sequentially. Europe was up 42.9% year over year and 1.8% sequentially, now representing 39% of revenue. CIS is down 5.4% year over year and represents only 8.4% of revenue. However, sequentially it grew 22.6%. Looking at service lines, we experienced no significant change in our revenue mix. Software development and application testing services continue to be our largest service offerings representing 69% and 20% of revenue respectively. Our top 20 clients accounted for 56.3% of total revenue and grew 30% while all our clients below the top 20 grew 33% year over year. Our customer loyalty remains high with over 90% of customers working for us for at least a year and 80% coming from those who have been with us for 2years. Each of our verticals grew year over year led by banking and financial services, our fastest-growing vertical, which increased 45.5% from prior year and represented 31% of our Q2 revenues. Trial non-consumer increased 27.2% and was 21% of revenues. Business information and media was up 22% accounting for 13% of total revenue, ISV and technology grew 12.5% accounting for 21.6% of revenue and the other vertical grew by 60% year-over-year and represents 12.7% of Q2. GAAP income from operations increased 5.4% year over year to represent 10.6% of revenue. Included in our operating results on a GAAP basis are stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, acquisition-related costs and certain other one-time items that we exclude from our non-GAAP measures. Full details of these can be found in our press release. Stock-based compensation expense increased 83.6% sequentially in Q2. This was due to stock that was granted as part of the acquisitions in the quarter, plus we had an employee stock option grant at the end of March. Also related to acquisitions, Q2 amortization of purchased intangibles more than tripled sequentially. Additionally, within one-time items for Q2 you will see a $2 million write-off. This relates to a building currently under construction in Minsk. In May the contractor we have been using notified us that they could no longer continue as general contractor to complete the building in time and on the terms that we had agreed. In early June EPAM provided the contractor with notice of termination of the contract construction agreement and requested payment of approximately $4.5 million which included the return of advance payments made by the Company. We do not expect to recover the full $4.5 million and have written off $2 million of these advance payments in Q2. We have taken control of the construction site and we are assessing all of our options to get this project back on track. After these adjustments our non-GAAP income from operations increased to 32.7% over prior year to $28.9 million, representing 16.5% of revenue. GAAP net income increased 4.9% year over year and non-GAAP net income grew 37.7% year over year. We completed the quarter with 10,533 IT professionals, excluding GGA, an increase of 18% compared to Q2 of 2013 and 8% sequentially. Utilization for the quarter was at 76.7%, about 1% higher than Q2 last year. For the quarter we generated $0.53 of non-GAAP EPS, also above the top end of our guidance, and 30% GAAP EPS based on approximately 49.6 million diluted shares outstanding. GGA, which was not included in our guidance, added about half a penny to our results in the quarter. Now turning to our balance sheet – we finished the quarter with approximately $175 million of cash, up approximately $6 million from December 31. During the second quarter operating activities generated approximately $15.4 million of cash. Unbilled revenues were at $68 million as of June 30, an increase of about $9 million compared to Q1. This sequential increase is normal as our fixed-price projects grow throughout the year and then expire in the fourth quarter. As a percentage of revenue this is still lower than Q2 of 2013. Accounts receivable were at $108 million at the end of Q2 and DSO ended the quarter at 52 days. Turning to our guidance. For the full year 2014 based on current conditions and including the impact of all acquisitions, EPAM expects year-over-year revenue growth to be 28% to 30%, non-GAAP net income growth for 2014 is expected to be in the range of 26% to 28% year over year with an effective tax rate of 20%. The full year weighted average share count is expected to be just over 50 million diluted shares outstanding. For the third quarter of 2014 EPAM expects revenue between $188 million and $190 million, representing a growth rate of 34% to 36% over third-quarter 2013 revenue. Third-quarter of 2014 non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.55 based on an estimated second-quarter weighted average shares outstanding of 50.3 million. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.27. I would now like to turn the call back to the operator and open up for Q&A. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. One moment while we pull for questions. Thank you. Our first question is from the line Moshe Katri of Cowen. Please proceed with your question. 
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Nice quarter. Can you look at your guidance for this year? Is there a way to kind of break down the incremental contributions from M&A to the 28% to 30% top-line growth guidance? Thanks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, I think there is – what we can share is contribution of GGA this quarter was $2.4 million and we shared this. It would be much more difficult to already separate what is happening with Jointech or even Netsoft because we're working on multiple projects together. And that is why we kind of put in transfers [inaudible] last quarter and it is more even difficult to do it this quarter. Our expectation, for example, for GGA, because it is a very different market segment in Life Sciences for us, would be that they will contribution this year around $16 million. At the same time, again, as we mentioned this quarter, we over performed consensus – consensus and guidance in an organic way as well.
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company: Okay, that is fair. And then was there any FX – were there any FX benefits or headwinds during the quarter to margins?
Anthony Conte: Yes, there was. There was about – during the quarter about $1 million of benefits in the revenue numbers.
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company: Okay. And where would that be on the income statement?
Anthony Conte: Net income though is about flat though, Moshe.
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company: Okay. Where would that be in the income statement, which items?
Anthony Conte:  Well, it is built into the revenue, it is built into our cost structure. So we get some benefits obviously from revenues that are invoiced in currencies other than US dollars. So we will see some benefits from that in the quarter and then we also will get some cost savings as well. So there is a net neutral impact on net income, but we will see some additional revenue benefits and some additional cost impacts from the movements in currencies.
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company: Okay, great. And then final question. Can we get an update on the Hong Kong acquisition, talk a bit about the potential there and whether we are seeing any deals in the pipeline from APAC at this point?
Arkadiy Dobkin:  We clearly are like not going to go in details on any specific opportunities. But in general our operation in China focused to serve first of all, and this would be for us a priority, to serve our existing clients. So we already share with the client from, again, even before acquisition. So there are some opportunities to expand global projects with a big part initiated in the region. But additionally, right now we're talking to several – our existing global clients which consider into – which allows us in expanding in the region. So – . And again, that would be our first priority. We are not planning right now to extensively market for local Chinese enterprises.
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company: Right. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller, Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Darrin Peller – Barclays Capital: Thanks, guys. Look, I just want to start off first with the – last quarter we obviously talked about certain clients that had greater exposure to either Ukraine or Russia as it pertains to labor sourcing. And it seemed like those clients were still growing with you. Yet, I think they were looking for other avenues of which to source labor for their projects. Is that – how has that gone? Is that still the case? I mean some of those were top of clients if I remember correctly. And where do we stand in terms of any future clients feeling impacts? It seems like obviously, as you mentioned on the call, the growth rate – and as apparent from your growth rate, you are not seeing much of an impact so far. So, so far so good, but any update would be great on that specifically.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, I only can repeat practically the same information we shared at last quarter. So in general we're growing in Ukraine, as we mentioned. So there are different situations with different clients, some of them fled, some of them growing, some of them going down a little bit in specifically Ukraine. So for some of them we put in more effort to bring them to different locations. But again, in general demand still exists and we're bringing new clients there. And just to repeat myself, I think that the demand for clients is so big that if some clients slowing down there kind of consideration for delivery from Ukraine there are some other clients which picking up this opportunity. And that is what we're seeing continues right now.
Darrin Peller – Barclays Capital: Okay. And so, I think you mentioned that you hadn't lost any clients, maybe that has changed. But I mean you haven't probably lost any new clients to any competitors, in other words market share has been unaffected so far from this?
Arkadiy Dobkin: You mean in regarding to Ukraine?
Darrin Peller – Barclays Capital: Yes, or – yes, I mean specifically Ukraine or…
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. No, we didn't lose any clients.
Darrin Peller – Barclays Capital: All right, that's…
Arkadiy Dobkin: I'm confirming this, yes.
Darrin Peller – Barclays Capital: All right. Just want to follow-up on the headcount number quickly also. I mean, the 18% growth rate I think you mentioned during the quarter, is that what I think if I remember if I heard you correctly. What is the expectation for us to hear? First of all, I assume that that 18% was just engineers specifically. What do you expect for the full year for headcount growth, if you don't mind? And maybe just a little more color on where you expect to actually replace those employees. And then a follow-up to that is sort of the relationship management oriented folks I think you were trying to really go after the past couple of quarters. How has that gone?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So this 18% actually includes 2 acquisitions, so you can think about it like it is around 300 people in comparison from last year was part of this 18%. I think in general we – and again, from organic point of view we were thinking about probably 16%, 18% total increase. But again, we will see what is happening during the next couple quarters and how the staff which we brought with acquisitions would impact it.
Darrin Peller – Barclays Capital: All right I mean but I guess just looking forward, again, 16% to 18%. And I think we asked this before, just the correlation between that and your revenue growth. The linearity has obviously widened out to some extent, you are growing much faster. So maybe just give us – I will leave it at this, but maybe you could just give us more color onto what is really driving that and how sustainable that is. Or should we expect some narrowing between those 2 variables going forward? Thanks again, guys.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Again multiple, multiple factors, general increase in blend in the rate. So each is coming from new contracts which is happening at higher rate as a rule, especially that some of them relate to more advanced work and price differently. So increase – as part of this as well, increase in headcount in United States and Western Europe. Annual increase in existing contracts, so a combination of all of this actually driving these factors.
Darrin Peller – Barclays Capital: So pricing is generally helping out. That is great. Okay, makes sense. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: I just wanted to go back to an earlier question asked by Moshe. So is the acquisition contribution from GGA in terms of the increment and guidance, was that $16 million then vis-a-vis where we were in terms of guidance at the end of last quarter?
Anthony Conte: Approximately, yes.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Because we increased revenue guidance about $17 million for the year. So should we kind of interpret that as the vast majority of that coming from the acquisition?
Anthony Conte: Yes, the vast majority is from the acquisition growth adjustment in our full-year guidance.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Right. And then, Arkadiy, I guess maybe in a perverse sense of logic here I am just wondering whether all the issues that are going on between Russia and the Ukraine, whether in fact companies who are committed to the region perhaps either had some in-house resources or were going to use more in-house resources, have decided that given the conflict and perhaps some of the incremental risk that there are more prone to use an outsource provider than do it in-house. Do you think any of that is going on right now or do think that is perhaps reading too much into the situation right now?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I'm sorry, let me clarify the question. Are you asking that some clients would utilize in-house resources where – versus going to the region?
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: No. I guess I'm just wondering whether in fact there is a tailwind to demand in the region because companies being risk-averse are less likely to engage in-house resources. But again, committed to the region and therefore are more likely to use an outsource provider if they are going to…
Arkadiy Dobkin: Do you mean the impact on general economy size of people wouldn't be careful hiding their own engineers and you will increase share of external providers, is that the question?
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Yes.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. No, I don't see this trend. I think in line with what we were kind of sharing for the last couple – during the last couple calls, I think the driver here for many of our clients actually to build new type of publication sooner than later. And that is driving the demand. And in many cases there is almost no option to do it internally.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, so then just getting back to my first question, it sounds like you outperformed a little bit in the quarter ex the acquisition. But when you kind of rolled that up into guidance you really just took the acquisition and that is basically the increase to guidance vis-a-vis where you were…
Arkadiy Dobkin: That is right. In general because while clearly there is a demand to fulfill this demand with right capabilities it is a challenging task. So we're kind of still between those two. And there is like while in general the situation that's impacting us, but you can see that, for example, our revenue in CS slowed down significantly and even to replace all the stuff and repurpose some delivery capabilities which would take time. It is not necessary that 1 or 2 quarters would be enough.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, I see.
Arkadiy Dobkin: But again, in general I think the growth is balanced between demand and our right – specific capabilities each client is looking for.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And then just the last question on that. Are you seeing any other vendors pulling out of the region because of the conflict?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Nobody like really pulling out, some people – oh you mean vendors.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Yes.
Arkadiy Dobkin: In my opinion maybe some very small ones, credibility of which were impacted by separation much more than more established. So maybe very little ones. But I don't think so.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And then just looking at the geographic mix, is the Asia Pac disclosure just a new disclosure or was that an acquisition? It just looks like it went from $0 to $3 million sequentially. I am just wondering what drove that or is that just new business with an Asia Pac client?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, a combination of those two, it is acquisition plus projects which we started there. And again, that was the reason to do acquisitions because we know that we have some opportunities in the region.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And then just finally, on the non-GAAP expenses or adjustments for the year, Anthony, I'm just wondering if you could give us some sense of how we should model those for the balance of the year given the spike in stock-based comp. And obviously you had a $2 million item in there as well. But you had amortization tick up. I mean, what are the right numbers we should be thinking about in the back half of the year?
Anthony Conte: Okay, yes, from a stock comp perspective you are going to see an additional increase as we go into Q3. t is probably going to jump up to about – what is the right number, it would be about probably $7.4 million in total stock comp in Q3 once the acquisitions are kind of a full up full quarter worth of stock comp charges. And then that number probably holds fairly consistent for a quarter going forward. And from an amortization of intangibles perspective, it is going to go up probably a little bit – I would say next quarter is going to go up by another $400,000 or so. So I would just factor in an additional $400,000 next quarter and hold that number going forward. And then obviously the write off for the Minsk building, we don't expect that to recur.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Right. And is there any other residual things we should think about in the context of that building and its impact on your capacity or anything like that?
Anthony Conte:  No, the building – the purpose of the building is obviously to consolidate our people from all the various locations in the Minsk into 1 central building. So what – the delay will just require us to keep those rented spaces for a little bit longer while we complete the building. But it should not impact our capacity and our abilities to recruit and have places for people to sit.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, got it. Thanks very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: So I guess my first question, Ark, I want to go back to your comments around digitization and the work being done with the CMO and so on. Could you take that maybe a step further? By the way, I agree with those comments completely. But can you take it one step forward and how is EPAM adapting to that trend in terms of its own talent hiring, in terms of its own account and sales management growth? Do you have to change the kind of salespeople and account managers you hire? Any comments along those lines?
Arkadiy Dobkin:  Yes, and thanks for question because it is exactly kind of in line and the reasoning why we shared this information because it is clearly impacting our organization and how we operate. And as you remember, our acquisition of digital strategy and experience design capabilities like almost 18, 19 months ago and [integration] of these capabilities, which bring new opportunities but clearly bring new challenges because, as I mentioned, it's similar to our clients. Kind of complications happen inside of organizations when you integrate creative parts and engineering parts. And that is a challenge which we do believe that we overcoming. And we've seen a lot of benefits from this. We also started to hire people with – we talked about it before – not once with consultant we're ground, with very strong industry we're ground. And the main point how to actually integrate all this, how to [inaudible] harmonize all this [inaudible] into the clients to bring not 3 or 4 or 5 organizations or skills but actually one. We're changing the profile of people we hired and we're changing some stuff in the Company to make sure it is happening. Because we do believe that the ones who would be able to do it in more efficient way to merge all these capabilities in one we think will be bringing the future opportunities.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: Got it. And does that potentially change your offshore on-site mix, make it a little bit more on-site, a little bit faster than planned? I know you have a plan in place anyway to modestly increase the on-site people ratio. But I'm wondering if this accelerates that trend?
Arkadiy Dobkin:  From one point of view it does and I think it is on an organic basis it does accelerate. At the same time with one of the recent GGA acquisition kind of we changed this ratio again because from one point this Company has a very, very strong industry expertise in life sciences space. From another point of view their onshore ratio is very little. So basically we kind of went forward, a little bit back, now we will need to compensate for this as well.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: Right. And that's probably a good transition because I did have a question on GGA. The $2.4 million contribution in the June quarter, obviously it is not – based on your other comments not appropriate to annualized that. Otherwise you would have raised your guidance by a bigger number. So what was the annualized revenue run rate for GGA? And how should we think of maybe the seasonality or lumpiness of that revenue stream?
Arkadiy Dobkin:  I just treat this table like – again, you can calculate easily from the acquisition date and our projection right now around $16 million [ph], for example, so you can get this number pretty simply. But from – it is a pretty stable contract, so long-term. So there is no [inaudible] seasonality there. So it is not consultant, consultant [inaudible], it is basically pretty much stable services through R&D parts of life sciences.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: Okay, understood. And I understand what they do. I think the focus between GGA and Netsoft towards healthcare, I think there is certainly a lot of demand in that area.
Arkadiy Dobkin:  Yes, that is exactly – we very much believe that we would be able to apply a lot of current capabilities which we develop certain other verticals to this one, because they become very much dependent on kind of system engagement type of applications which we build good expertise to deliver during the last several years.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: Okay. My last question if I can – I may have missed this. Did you mention CapEx for the full year and free cash flow outlook? Has that changed? I may have missed that, sorry.
Anthony Conte: We did, I mean our normal CapEx is still going to be in that $12 million to $14 million range. There were probably be an uptick with the building – we're going to have to spend a little bit more on the building now to get that going. And that estimate right now is somewhere in the $6 million range over the next 12 months. So probably this year about half of that and the rest will be maybe next year.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: Okay. And then once you have that building will that result in rental costs going down as you move your people? Is that sort of a future benefit we should think about? 
Anthony Conte: That is the plan assuming that we don't grow beyond that capacity and have to look for additional space for growth and headcount. But the plan is to consolidate into 1 location. We will see in 12 months if that benefit is still realizable or if we…
Arkadiy Dobkin: And again, the size of the building will not allow us to consolidate in 1 place.
Anthony Conte: Right.
Arkadiy Dobkin: In Minsk anyway, so it is still [inaudible]. And by the time we finish we probably will grow to another building again.
Anthony Conte: Right.
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay, got it. Thank you, guys. Congratulations.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich of UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Speaker: This is Peter in for Steve Milunovich. Ark, can you talk about the performance in the CIS region? Was that impacted at all by sanctions from the UN and the US towards Russia? And if the sanction situation were to get more complicated having delivery centers in Russia, would that impact the business at all?
Arkadiy Dobkin: There is definitely risk like that. But – and the answer would be we're not impacted directly by the sanctions but probably sanctions if not yet potentially can impact the economy in Russia and it would in turn impact our clients and us as well. So, but as you can see even during the last couple years, the trend was the proportion of business in Russia was going down for us and we don't consider this as a very big risk. From the point of view which allows resources, we will be able to reassign these resources to other clients. But again it would take some time. So basically the worst-case scenario, if something would happen very kind of transactionally, like if something would happen overnight then it could impact us for a couple quarters. But we rather expect that it would be more kind of transitional work if anything. And also I would say that – and I mentioned this during our last conversations. During the last couple years we decreased our dependence in Russia from government services a lot. So we still have some clients which are partially owned by government, but at the same time some business in Russia coming for us and increasing from private enterprises specifically in retail and consumer goods areas where we're implementing a lot of new large e-commerce implementations kind of independent from sanctions. But again economy could impact this as well clearly.
Unidentified Speaker: Thank you. And then you talked about some new business coming in with the higher rate card. Can you talk about some of the pricing that has been going on with your renewals or the core business and how that has been trending?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we can repeat what we were saying before. The general kind of blended increase has been around what, 7%-8%?
Anthony Conte: 7%-8%, yes.
Arkadiy Dobkin: 7%-8% a year each. Big portion of this coming from new contracts signed in high rates. And some of this from increasing the annual rates moving people from one skill set or experience level to another. So I don't think I can give you more information on this.
Unidentified Speaker: Okay, that is fair. And then in terms of the sequential change in the utilization rate, was that more of a factor of recent acquisitions or the Easter holiday? Were there other impacts to that?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think it's both. So there is some utilization – some level of the utilization impacted by acquisitions. And also increase in [inaudible], because you know there are 5 kind of cycles there and we were talking before that we, for example, in 2012 hired a lot of people and then we were utilizing this bench due to the 2013. Now we have a little bit of increase in starting to kind of compensate for this. And, yes, June vacations also already impacting [inaudible].
Unidentified Speaker: And then a final question following up on the Minsk building. Do you foresee any changes to your headcount addition plans pushing this out? Does this slow down your plans for headcount growth either in delivery or in support staff?
Arkadiy Dobkin: No. We in Minsk we always rely significantly on leasing external space. And we have a good base of this and we have enough – enough room there.
Unidentified Speaker: Great, thank you. Good quarter, guys.
Operator: Thank you. At this time I would like to turn the floor back to Mr. Arkadiy Dobkin for closing comments.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay, thank you for joining today. Thank you for listening to us. And we hope to continue reform and update you in 3 months. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2014 Q1  (2014-05-02 08:00:00) =====
Executives:  Lilya Chernova – Investor Relations Arkadiy Dobkin – Chief Executive Officer and President Anthony J. Conte – Chief Financial Officer 
Analysts:  Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company, LLC Mayank Tandon – Needham & Company, LLC Steve M. Milunovich – UBS Securities LLC David M. Grossman – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.  
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the EPAM Systems First Quarter 2014 results conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Lilya Chernova for EPAM Systems. Thank you, you may begin. 
Lilya Chernova: Thank you and good morning everyone. By now you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the Company’s first quarter 2014 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our Web site epam.com. The speakers on today’s call are Arkadiy Dobkin, Chief Executive Officer and Anthony Conte, Chief Financial Officer. Before I begin I’d like to remind you that some of the comments made in today’s call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the Company’s earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Arkadiy?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Lilya. Good morning to everyone and thanks for joining us today. I’m pleased to report that our first quarter results were better than we planned. Financially, we exceeded both guidance and consensus. EPAM revenue in Q1 was $160.4 million, a sequential increase of 2% and 29% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was up almost 30% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin was in the range of 16.4%. Anthony will review the quarterly results in more details a bit later, and provide you our guidance for Q2 and the full year. During the last earnings call, we gave a good level of details about EPAM’s history, and its 20 year long transition from being a strictly software engineering services company to a much more solution oriented provider with specific industry focus. We analyze the reasons why today EPAM is focusing on a particular subset of the overall ITO market. We also provided multiple highlights on a number of reasons why this specific segment is growing faster than the rest of the market and why EPAM has a better position to serve the segments in comparison with a number of other players. We list the type of challenges and requirements with the providers to successfully serve the segment and talked about EPAM investments to shave the company accordingly and to better address the clients’ needs. We also used the example of a large North American retailer to illustrate how the investments we made helped prepare EPAM for these new types of engagements, which would have been practically impossible for us to deliver just several years ago. Finally, we stated that one of the indications of the positive results of all our efforts was the increased attention from the industry analysts in the second half of 2013 when over 20 different reports mentioned EPAM. We are great to see that this strength is continuing in 2014. In March Forrester, a leading independent research analyst firm, published it’s Forrester Wave report to Deloitte for its first time the vendors for the emerging market recalled software for the development services, or DVS. First, I would like to stress that this report further confirms the strategic market opportunity we consider a focus area for us. Using this report, many of the concept discussed during our last call were reinforced, including such as many companies in traditionally non-software related markets, a decline in software vendors currently and software is become an important part of their brand. Another one that developing software enable products present a new set of challenges for nontraditional software companies. And finally to meet the challenges, these companies are looking for certain partners that have the skill set necessary to address their needs. Second, and I think it’s important to mention this report in line with the Forrester Wave general methodology was conducted during transparent approach of comparing the players in specific software market so the potential clients of those players can make well informed decisions without spending months of their own research. Such revelations both included assessments by many, 14 in this specific case, criteria and a number of extensive customer interviews, all of which were performed anonymously. For the study, 11 of the most significant providers in this emerging market were selected and a portion of their clients were interviewed. As a result EPAM emerged as the leader, one of only two in their evaluation. EPAM scored the highest of all providers on driving innovation and helping to create innovative new products. We also have the highest score on customer reference and user experience design capabilities. While we do understand that all such reports have some subjective component. We’re clearly very pleased with our rating especially considering we have emerged against some very strong competition. In addition, this recognition reinforces that EPAM is well positioned to take advantage of the current market trends. Now, let us cover two important acquisitions, which closed since our last call, and explain how they’re going to play in the overall EPAM strategy. First about Netsoft. In March EPAM acquired Netsoft, a technology consulting firm based in the United States and Armenia, specializing in the healthcare and health insurance industries. Netsoft has experienced work in some of the leading health plans in the United States on the medical management and claim systems, accountable care organization, telemedicine, healthcare analytics, personalized medicine, health information exchanges and online self-service capabilities. As we all know healthcare and health insurance are moving forward quickly to transition it sales into much more consumer oriented environments. That we believe that they are becoming very software dependent industries, right in line with what we are seeing happening in the retail, media, and business information sectors. As a result, there is growing demand to build many new software solutions where large number of insured individuals and patients are engaging as direct users of those solutions in a day-to-day healthcare and health insurance procedures. As we discussed last time those solutions should satisfy a very new set of characteristics and require very special set of skills to build and to implement. That is why this is clearly one of the most interesting IT segments in the United States and globally as well. Netsoft’s deep strategic and technological expertise in healthcare combined with EPAM scale our own experience in that field, strong knowledge of how to build consumer centric software solutions and many new enabled green technologies for those solutions position us very well to take advantage of the future opportunities in this space. The consideration for Netsoft was a mix of cash and stock. Total potential consideration included an earn out is $6 million payable over the next 12 months. Second view, just yesterday we announced another important acquisition of Jointech, which expands EPAM’s presence in the APAC region in the financial services vertical. The company is based in Hong Kong and has its engineering centers in Shenzhen, China and presence in Singapore. It currently employees over 215 employees focused on solutions for multinational organizations in the investment banking and office management industry. This is important step for EPAM. It is definitely outside of our traditional geographies in Europe and North America where we have significant presence and have extensive operational experience. So it wasn’t an easy decision for us to proceed. At the same time our large global clients were asking us for sometime to consider providing services in the APAC geographies in addition to what we did in North America and Europe, especially when we were getting involved in two new large global programs. As we know, to address that, we opened EPAM offices in Hong Kong and Singapore last year. But in addition we were trying to identify the right potential partner in the region to scale faster locally. We do believe that Jointech, with its focus on quality software engineering and their long-term experience of service in very demanding large global investment banking clients is a right one. In addition, we also had an opportunity to work together with Jointech for service client during the last month, which made us even more comfortable in making the final step. While the initial focus of our operations in China will be to continue service the investment banking clients. We plan to extend the services to some customers operating in the APAC region and other verticals as well. The acquisition consideration is $20 million in mix of cash and stock. The total potential purchase price might be increased based on the future performance during the earn out period in the range from zero to $25 million. To conclude on this topic, I would like to say that currently our M&A pipeline remains strong and we continue to focus on opportunities that will bring us into new vertical markets or improve our position in existing markets, expand our geographic presence from both perspective; serving local clients and providing global delivery services or enhance our horizontal service offering across multiple industries. As you can see the two acquisitions we talked today, formally fit into these categories and in general, are helping us to shape the company to better address the market we focus on. The future targets will be consistent with that direction. I am sure you all have seen the retirement announcement for Karl Robb. I am very sorry that Karl will be stepping down from his day-to-day operational role. Karl has been a strong leader and available member of the management team at EPAM over the past 10 years. And while he will be missed we expect Karl to continue contributing as a Board member in the long run. We are currently working on the transition plan and we will roll it out over the next month. Lastly I’m sure you all expecting our comment on the situation in Ukraine and Russia. How it is affecting or could potentially affect our business? We will provide some color on the situation after presenting to you results of our quarterly performance together with regular financial details, and after showing our guidelines for Q2 and to the end of the year. Therefore I would like now to turn over to Anthony to do that. Anthony?
Anthony J. Conte:  Thank you Ark and good morning everyone. I am going to spend a few minutes taking you through the first quarter results. Then I will talk more about our Q2 and full year outlook. As usual the full details of our results can be found on our press release and the quarterly fact sheet located on the Investor Section of our Web site. As detailed in our press release the first quarter revenues grew 29.1% over last year and 1.8% sequentially to $160.4 million, above the top end of our guidance. The overall performance in the quarter was driven by continued momentum from Q4, primarily in Europe, thereby offsetting the normal Q1 slow down. Europe was up 48.7% year-over-year and 20% sequentially, representing 42% of revenue in the quarter. North America remains our largest segment representing 49.3% of revenue up 25.8% year-over-year. CIS did experience some Q1 slow down, decreasing 17.8% year-over-year and representing only 7.5% of revenue. However, about 14% of this drop is related to the devaluation of the Russian ruble in Costange with the balance attributed to a slower than normal budget cycle in the region. Looking at service lines we experienced no significant change in our revenue mix, software development and application testing services continue to be our largest service offering, representing 69% and 20% of revenue respectively. Our top 20 clients accounted for 57.3% of total revenue and grew 31.2%, while all our clients below the top 20, grew 26.2% year-over-year. Our customer loyalty remains high with over 90% of customers working with us for at least a year and 80% coming from those who have been with us for at least two years. Each of our verticals grew year-over-year, led by banking and financial services, our fastest growing vertical, which increased 45.9% from prior year and represents 29.6% of our Q1 revenues. Travel and Consumer increased 33.4% and was 22.7% of revenue, Business Information & Media was up 19.2% accounting for 13.1% of total revenue. ISV & Technology grew 8% accounting for 21.7% of revenue and the other vertical group 43.1% year-over-year and represents 11.7% of Q1. The Travel and Consumer vertical led our sequential growth with 9.3% growth over Q4. Business Information & Media continued the recovery seen in 2013 growing sequentially 5.8% over Q4. GAAP income from operations increased 40.7% year-over-year to represent 13.6% of revenue, included in our operating results on a GAAP basis, where our stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of purchase intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and certain other one-time items are included from our non-GAAP measures. Full details on these can be found on our press release. Non-GAAP income from operations increased 39.5% over the prior year to $26.3 million, representing 16.4% of revenue. GAAP net income increased 36.9% year-over-year. And non-GAAP net income grew 39.7% year-over-year. We completed the quarter with 9,759 IT professionals, an increase of 12%, compared to Q1 of 2013 and 5% sequentially. Utilization for the quarter was at 79.6% about 5% higher than the Q1 2013, further supporting that 29% growth in revenue. For the quarter, we generated $0.47 of non-GAAP EPS, also above the top end of our guidance. And $0.35 GAAP EPS, based on approximately $49.2 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning now to our balance sheet, we finished the quarter with approximately $174 million of cash, up approximately $5 million from December 31. During the first quarter operating activities generated approximately $16.2 million of cash. This is the first Q1 with positive cash flow in many years. Unbilled revenues were $59 million at March 31, an increase of $16 million, compared to the end of 2013. This sequential increase is normal for Q1 as many of our 60 projects restart on a calendar year. However, as a percentage of revenue, this is lower than our normal Q1 trends. Accounts receivables were at $90 million at the end of Q1, down 6%from year-end. And DSO ended the quarter at 55 days. Turning to our guidance for the full year 2014 based on current conditions and including the impact of the Netsoft and Jointech acquisitions, EPAM expects year-over-year revenue growth to be 25% to 27%. Non-GAAP net income growth for 2014 is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25% year-over-year with effective tax rate of 20%. The full year weighted average share count is expected to be just over 50 million diluted shares outstanding. For the second quarter of 2014 EPAM expects revenues between $168 million and $170 million, representing a growth rate of 26% to 27% over the second quarter 2013 revenues. Second quarter of 2014 non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.47 to $0.48 based on an estimated second quarter weighted average shares of $49.7 million. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.30 to $0.32. I will now like to turn the call back over to Arkadiy. Ark?
Arkadiy Dobkin:  Thank you, Anthony, so I would like to return to current situation in Ukraine and what we see there. So first of all, I would like to say that all EPAM locations continue to operate normally. We are monitoring daily and our daily reports show that attendance rate in the offices in the region is all at above normal in comparison with 12th month from today. So in the first quarter of 2014 EPAM grew Ukraine delivery capacity by 5% sequentially. And this reflects our commitment and opportunity – and also commitment and optimism from majority of our clients operating in the region. It is EPAM, not any of our clients have initiated disaster recovery or started to execute business continuing to program steps. It’s also worth mentioning again that the majority of our clients engaging in multiple locations and those which operate only in Ukraine, monitoring situation together is observed very, very closely to make sure that we can react together if necessary. Recently these sanctions don’t affect EPAM. Those sanctions were introduced and later expanded with a target to the Russian government or government control in some enterprises, and don’t confirm EPAM as being not related in any way to government working. Production protests in eastern Ukraine have not disturbed EPAM operations. We have two offices in the region in Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk, and both of them operate normally without disruption during all this time. I think the next important milestone is election is scheduled right now for May 26, and clearly the situation changes daily there. As usual, we are monitoring this very closely. We will be happy to answer some questions from you, but that’s all we can share with you right now. Thank you, and I would ask operator to start Q&A session.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we’ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company, LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Nice quarter, guys. Arkadiy and Anthony, can we get a feel on the revenue contribution or expected revenue contribution for both acquisitions this year? So we’re trying to figure out how much of that guidance raised for revenue growth came from those acquisitions and how much of that is organic. Thanks.
Anthony J. Conte:  Moshe, as you know historically, we don’t really separate out the revenue for the acquisitions. Our plan is to integrate them quickly. So the revenue raised is really a blended number with some synergies built into it. So we don’t disclose the separate trend for the acquisitions. Consistent with how we’ve done acquisitions in the past we’ll integrate them very quickly.
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company, LLC: So, I mean, this is a very valid question, and typically companies start integrating acquisitions and don’t disclose an organic number a year after the acquisition. So I think it’s a very valid question to understand whether the top line growth guidance raised is predominantly coming in from those acquisitions or not.
Arkadiy Dobkin: We didn’t decrease our organic growth projections, which we said it before. So, we cannot grow – we’re not planning to grow this specific number, but again our organic projections stay in line.
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company, LLC:  Okay. So, that’s fine. And then, you mentioned 250 headcount for the Hong Kong-based acquisition. How about the first acquisition that you mentioned? How much would that add in terms of headcount?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Very small. It’s less than 50.
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company, LLC:  Okay. Can we get an update on your ramp up in terms of sales personnel, which is something that you started doing I think a year, a year and a half ago?
Arkadiy Dobkin:  So this number is increasing, but, again, it’s like single-digit numbers. In percentages, it’s relatively significant increase. In absolute numbers, again, it’s single-digit numbers for our increased indirect sales personnel.
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company, LLC:  So how many people do we have right now?
Anthony J. Conte: Less than 20 at this point still.
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company, LLC:  Okay. But it’s still a pretty nice increase.
Anthony J. Conte: Yes.
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company, LLC:  And final question, can we talk a bit about the existing pipeline of new deals, talk about the recent new wins, if you will? Which areas have you seen strength? Which areas have you not seen strength? And some color here is going to be helpful.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So you can probably get it even from the growth numbers. We’ve had some good success in banking and financing, in retail and we have got our investments outside of our kind of key industries, but we can share names. Anyway, let me say that there are some (indiscernible) and excited wins for Fortune 100 companies as well. 
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company, LLC: Just final question here for Anthony. You mentioned the unbilled. How closely do you typically watch the fixed price contracts in terms of delivery, in terms of milestones? And then also can you give us the free cash flow number for the quarter? Thanks.
Anthony J. Conte:  Sure. On the unbilled and the fixed fee specifically, we actually watch them quite closely. So we are constantly monitoring that on a month-to-month basis to determine how much we have in unbilled, how much work is being delivered, and just making we’re hitting the milestones and making sure we understand the collectability of that unbilled. So that’s a regular monthly activity for us. As far as the free cash flows go, free cash flows for the quarter were at $12.5 million. 
Moshe Katri – Cowen and Company, LLC: Thanks.
Anthony J. Conte:  Welcome.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Mayank Tandon – Needham & Company, LLC:  Thank you. Good morning. Congrats on the strong quarter. I just wanted to piggyback off of Moshe’s question. Anthony, just to get some clarity on the first quarter performance, was that all organic or was there any contribution from the Netsoft deal?
Anthony J. Conte:  It was all organic. Netsoft closed in early March, so it had a very immaterial impact on the quarter.
Mayank Tandon – Needham & Company, LLC:  Okay. So the $22 million increase in the revenue guidance off the initial guidance, there obviously was upside in the first quarter. Did you say that the increase was a blend of M&A and organic growth? Did I hear you right?
Anthony J. Conte:  You’re taking on the full year I assume?
Mayank Tandon – Needham & Company, LLC: Yes.
Anthony J. Conte:  Yes. It’s a blend of – and as Ark mentioned, our organic guidance did not change.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Didn’t go down. 
Anthony J. Conte: Did not go down, and it is a blended number between the acquisitions and organic growth, taking into account the synergies that we expect to benefit from the integration of the two acquisitions.
Mayank Tandon – Needham & Company, LLC:  Okay. I think I understand. And then in terms of margins, could you just comment on where you expect the margins to fall for the year based on the current guidance? And are there any incremental costs associated with any spending related to the Ukraine situation?
Anthony J. Conte:  The incremental cost that we’ve incurred regarding to Ukraine is relatively immaterial. It’s been a few advisors and a few consultants that we brought into just help us flush out some plans, but it’s not really having any impact on our margins. So, we expect our margins for the year to coming in the same, the 16% to 18% range that we consistently speak of. That’s still our target range.
Mayank Tandon – Needham & Company, LLC:  Okay. And no incremental expenses associated with the acquisition as well?
Anthony J. Conte:  No. We exclude them from the adjusted margin numbers, so there are obviously some pro-fees, legal fees, things of that nature that we do incur through the acquisition process, but we carve them out when you look at the adjusted numbers.
Mayank Tandon – Needham & Company, LLC:  Okay. And a few other questions. I wanted to get some clarity on the metrics around hiring attrition and wage increases. Could you remind us when you give annual wage increases, and what is the magnitude of that that is reflected in the numbers? And also where was the attrition in the quarter and then what are the hiring plans for the remainder of the year to get to your growth targets?
Anthony J. Conte:  Well, we have annual increases occur in the first quarter. So they are reflected within our Q1 numbers. The production wage inflation offshore came in around 5% and sellable attrition was at 10%. And what was the third metric you asked? I’m sorry.
Mayank Tandon – Needham & Company, LLC:  Let me get some sense of the hiring plans for the remainder of the year to get to your growth targets.
Anthony J. Conte:  Hiring plans remain the same. We’re talking about a 15%, 16% growth in our overall headcount.
Mayank Tandon – Needham & Company, LLC:  Okay.
Anthony J. Conte:  IT production headcount.
Mayank Tandon – Needham & Company, LLC: All right, great. I’ll jump back in queue if I have anything else. Thank you.
Arkadiy Dobkin:  Okay. 
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Steve M. Milunovich – UBS Securities LLC:  Thank you. Could you comment on the gross margin, which, at 36.1%, was a little bit lighter than recently?
Anthony J. Conte: The gross margin would be impacted in the quarter by some of the wage inflation pressures that we experienced in the first quarter. So, that would have brought that down a bit.
Steve M. Milunovich – UBS Securities LLC:  So, do you expect that to bounce back up in the future?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It will be improving a little bit when we will start to bring new people to our organization. 
Steve M. Milunovich – UBS Securities LLC:  Okay. A couple of your large competitors, IBM, Accenture, have talked about some application maintenance pricing pressure. I know it’s a small part of your business, but do you have any comments on that? Are you seeing anything in the marketplace? Are you perhaps causing some of that?
Arkadiy Dobkin: As you stated, it is very little part of our business today. And given maintenance and support issues and we talked about it in our previous calls. It’s different from regular maintenance and support for large legacy systems. We practically don’t have this business. Why it’s happening, probably exactly because a lot of this replacing and competition for this business becoming more stronger, because of it’s kind of eventually going down, but it doesn’t impacting us?
Steven M. Milunovich – UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. And regarding the pipeline longer-term, obviously you’ve got pretty good confidence in the year. But what’s the tone of your conversations with your customers in terms of their longer-term concerns about the political unrest in the region? Do you feel like they are less likely to spend with you and new customers as well, or do you think there’s going to be a little bit of hesitation over time?
Arkadiy Dobkin: At this particular point, we didn’t see any specific kind of consolation or strong hesitation. Like everybody is hoping the country to be stabilized are going away with time. And most of our large clients have experienced separation in different geographies then to through a lot of different situations. Like just as anecdotal evidence, I would say that one recently become on the vendor list for one of the very big Fortune 500 companies, and went into a scenario, and actually the situation come up. His answer was yes, I’m worried about it but I’m worried about any emerging countries and global occasion. And at this point, my risk is much higher from the kind of proportion of doing business like in India, and any conflict in India, who is bringing us down very quickly because of some large portion of aggression is there. So even we know what’s happening in Eastern Europe, it would still be considered an integration of the global scale. And it’s difficult to call it right now. We didn’t see anything like clearly if escalation in the region would increase, it might change. That’s the degree factor and clearly what it was.
Steven M. Milunovich – UBS Securities LLC:  Okay. Then finally, are you in the process of looking for a new marketing head, and is that slowing you down at all?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It’s not slowing us down. So it’s unfortunate that it didn’t work out but at the same time, it was practically for six months and right now we are filling this position internally and now understand, what we can get externally in some cases, and we will be looking for opportunities to bring somebody in, but it’s not a critical thing right now.
Steven M. Milunovich – UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you Ark.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
David M. Grossman – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.:  Thank you. Could you just help us understand what percentage of your clients that are operating in the Ukraine are currently using you in other areas outside of the Ukraine?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, you first practically only one client reach. Not 100%, but large percentage dedicated to Ukraine. The rest of the clients, who each operate in Ukraine, they also are working without developments unforeseen, Hungary, or Belarus, or Poland or Russia.
David M. Grossman – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And is that one client one of the top two or is it one of the smaller clients?
Arkadiy Dobkin:  No. It’s one of the top two.
David M. Grossman – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.:  It is, okay. And just if you could maybe at a very high level help us understand what it takes to migrate work out of the Ukraine into another geography?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It depends on clients and that’s why our plan is very much client oriented. While, as Anthony mentioned, we clearly tune in right now, our business continues to plan and developed the required plans based on what we have seen on the ground, but again it’s very much client-dependent. And for very large clients, there’s clearly not an easy solution if something were to happen. Okay. And then real starvation would happen then, yes, I think there would be a lot of problems outside of that thinking about specific clients of theirs, and it’s basically people problems.
David M. Grossman – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. And then I think this came up in a prior question, but is there anything – I guess just thinking about the pipeline more than anything else, I assume you have active conversations, and they’ve got – the potential customers or the existing customers looking to expand their business with you have a pallet of options in terms of where they can put the work. So as you kind of outline kind of the capacity in the Ukraine, what’s the dialogue around just let’s wait and see, is it let’s go forward and wait and see, or just let’s not talk about that and think about one of your other facilities? Just trying to get some insight into how customers in the pipeline are really thinking about the region right now?
Arkadiy Dobkin: And I would say that it’s practically all over the country, as you mentioned. So, some clients lead slate, all action some clients really spread some console and kind of delaying decisions. Some clients do increase their staff in Ukraine. Again, it’s a broad spectrum of situation, because it depends on clients’ kind of connection to the region because some of them traveling often and seeing by their eyes what’s happening on the ground. Some of them at the region based on integration policies on corporate level, so it is very different. The only thing I can say right now is to – and I cannot say what exactly it will be in Q2 but in Q1 despite already some call it escalation we still grew headcount in Ukraine by 5% on quarter-by-quarter basis, which is exactly in line with our growth on the corporate level.
David M. Grossman – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.:  All right.
Arkadiy Dobkin: We’re obviously considering different options. We have Hungarian operations we just need to scale, but we are very much focused on expanding in Poland right now, so Belarus is growing, so we can see the impact on new locations in Eastern Europe. And you see China happen to be now on EPAM delivery route as well. So we plan to mitigate risk I have to say for the Ukraine, but in long-term, we are absolutely committed to Ukraine operation.
David M. Grossman – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.:  Right. And just last on this, and I know these are all difficult questions to answer, but is there been any concern just more broadly about the region so that the Belarus, while not an issue today, where people are kind of just lumping the former Soviet countries or pieces into the entire equation, or has that really not come up as an area?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It would be naive to say that there is no risk in the region in general. And I assume you’re talking about it from the first IPO date. And I lived in this environment for a long, long time, so there’s always risk. And right now risk increased, so I cannot tell you this.
David M. Grossman – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: 
 :
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, some clients prefer in Belarus today, but I think it’s still kind of very much fuzzy and cannot give you like exact opinion because there is no enough information from my point of view for this. So, with those clients growing in Ukraine, some of them, clients still considering Russia as well.
David M. Grossman – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. Okay. And just one last question, just on the Jointech acquisition. Are the financial characteristics of that business, I know it’s relatively small, but the margin profile of that business, is that similar to your own or does that have different characteristics?
Arkadiy Dobkin: The smaller business, it’s lower profitability today, but we very clearly see the rate, how to be increased and how the separation would be used to scale our operation in APAC region. So, we do believe that, by the end of the year, we will bring them to our normal profitability. 
David M. Grossman – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And so as you think of scaling that business, that includes scaling the delivery capacity in the region as well. Is that correct?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes.
David M. Grossman – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ve come to the end of our time for questions. I’d like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Dobkin for any closing comments.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you everyone for joining us today. And you see Q1 gave us a strong start to the year, but clearly we still have some challenges, and we understand not all of them different from us. We look forward to speaking with you in three months at the end of our second quarter and thank you. And have a nice day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the EPAM Systems Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Farrell Kramer. Thank you. Mr. Kramer, you may begin.
Farrell Kramer: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, epam.com. The speakers on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, Chief Executive Officer; and Anthony Conte, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Farrell, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. This December, we celebrated our 20th year in business and now I am proud to say that it was another strong year of growth for EPAM. EPAM's fourth quarter performance was better than we planned and in turn allow us to exceed our full year guidance, which we had revised upward in early October. Our fourth quarter revenue were $157 million, a sequential increase of 12% and an increase of 26% year-over-year. For the full year 2013, we delivered $555 million of revenue, which represented industry-leading growth of 28%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was within our target range at 17.4% for the quarter and 16.5% for the full year. Anthony will later review the quarter and year financials in more details, as well as give you our 2014 guidance. What I would like to discuss is the evolution of EPAM, some highlights of 2013, as well as explain a bit more on how we see the market growing and the opportunities for EPAM within this market. As we noted many times in the past, EPAM was born and iterated for many years as a company focusing on software engineering services for commercial software firms by helping them bring into life the products for their own clients. In turn, that focus on commercial software development allowed us to build a very strong engineering culture within the company and provided us with the opportunity to gain hands-on exposure to bring emerging technology trends, advanced development processes and techniques ahead of our competitors. Over time, our focus started to shift from only serving software and technology market to providing services to the firms operating outside of that segment. In 2007, the majority of our revenue was coming from ISVs & Technology. Just 6 years later, in 2013, financial services was 28% of our business, travel and consumer was 21% and Business Information & Media was 14%. Why invest in those industries? The driver to that was the number of firms which saw an increasing proportion of their value proposition coming from software and software-related services and had very quickly to adapt to new digitally-driven business models to stay competitive. These increasingly software-centric forms were not traditional software companies. Instead they were concentrated exactly in the industries of media, retail, financial services and information and data providers [indiscernible]. Target [indiscernible] business models, which rely on building commercial-grade software, they need to have access to engineering discipline, agile processes and deep technical know-how, which was difficult to find in traditional IT services shops or in-house corporate departments. Those of you who have been with us since our IPO will remember that we talked about this trend during the [indiscernible] show exactly 2 years ago. Since that time, the technology around mobile, social, cloud and analytics has continued to change and have only increased the software complexity and the potential value proposition for this class of clients. It is very clear now that our shift in this specific direction wasn't accidental. The clients in those industries are actively reinventing and redesigning large portions of their business models to stay relevant in fast-changing market situations. According to the industry analysts, the market for those clients is growing about 2x faster than traditional IT services. At the same time, the market expects a very challenging set of capabilities from the providers to satisfy the demands of this class of clients as they shift towards a very new type of client-to-client [indiscernible], interactive systems of engagement made possible by new, disruptive technologies, while in the past the main capabilities' drivers for IT members [indiscernible] were legacy systems of records and iterations [indiscernible]. It is important to understand that these new systems of engagement are also driving very new needs for that legacy part by forcing them to evolve or be replaced. So the legacy applications have to detach [indiscernible] more and more. All combined, this creates very challenging requirements for the application delivery process and to the skill sets necessary to deliver the solutions in this fast-growing market segment. To be relevant, providers have to demonstrate hybrid capabilities, including industry-domain expertise and technology consulting, very strong computer experience skills is a must requirement, ability to provide the demanded philosophy of the business [indiscernible], knowledge of the current [indiscernible] application security paradigms, middleware structures and legacy data models, ability to rely on broader partner [indiscernible] system because, in the constant argument of build or buy, the build and buy is winning [indiscernible].  Finally, on top of all that, a key requirement is that the provider should have a strong engineering product development mindset and engineering culture. Why they are focusing on all this right now? First, because there are a few global delivery service providers in the market with a strong engineering product development mindset and culture. It's very difficult to build that fast. We do believe that we have all that as a result of our last 20 years and that is why we see it as a significant opportunity for EPAM to capitalize on that specific market. Second, it allows us to identify a number of key investments, which we started several years ago and continue to make today to bridge the skills and experience gap and equip EPAM with this hybrid skill set. So let's see what progress we did during the last year. We are investing in our client management capabilities across our all current locations, also setting new offices in North America, in L.A., in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.; and Europe, in Netherlands; and expanding in new-for-us places like Hong Kong, Singapore and Sydney. We improved significantly our capabilities in financial services and Retail and Consumer by hiring directly from the industry senior individuals with strong domain expertise. This strengthened our [indiscernible] organization and specific technology consulting capabilities by bringing a number of high-profile technologies with good client interactive skills in such key domains as BI, data warehousing, Big Data, e-Commerce and content, enterprise mobility and cloud. We expanded our digital strategy and user experience capabilities, both from the depth of the skill set and from the proximity to the clients point of view. Now EPAM [indiscernible] has representation in L.A., in London, in Moscow and Hong Kong. We continue to invest in the development of a number of accelerators to improve our solution sourcing [indiscernible] in our key industries. We started, also, to capitalize on partnerships with market leaders in e-Commerce, Digital marketing and BI/Big Data. We are investing in new enterprise social knowledge managing platform with integrated HR-ADOC [ph] functions, which is very important for productivity and agility of our production process. Finally, we continue to invest in internal and preproduction training programs for our people and into general IT educational processes via strong university relationship. We are very keen to maintain our engineering and product development mindset, which is critically important to deliver tangible results to our clients. In connection to that, I would note that we still have a strong revenue share from the enterprise software product and technology vertical, which is 24% of our business and over 80 clients, which allow us to maintain very close relationship with emerging technology skills, trends and processes and help us to understand well what is coming next. We believe that as a result of these efforts, in the second half of 2013, EPAM started to receive much more attention from the industry analysts. About 20 different reports published by Gartner, Forrester, Everest and several others focusing on general IT services as well as very specific topics of capital markets and welcomed [indiscernible] e-Commerce and content, mobile and cloud, SAP and application testing mentioned EPAM. We also believe that our investments help us to address many of our existing and new client informational [indiscernible] challenges. I would show you just one program for a large retailer in North America, which we started to bill royalties about 18 months ago. First of all, EPAM global team benefited from our strong on-site capabilities to lead the complex engagement locally and provide consultative, close-to-client approach to the whole program. On-site team also led the client in Agile transformation to delivery and also helped closely manage the whole Agile process in one multi-pronged [indiscernible] development centers and client staff. Our specialized user experience, e-Commerce content and mobility solution units were helping to address complex digital transformational challenges by bringing to life end-to-end digital experience to clients' customers. Our Big Data competency helped to put in place enabled partnership [indiscernible] with analytics. Our SAP advanced technology unit helped to solve a number of unfavorable programs in clients' legacy supply management system and enabled necessary integration for installing other components. On top of that, we got involved in the extended legacy integration and support programs. It is an excellent illustration of how our investment help us to prepare for such type of engagement, which would be, for us, practically impossible to win several years ago. More and more, we are seeing that our competencies and solution-focused efforts are making the difference, demonstrating our growing capabilities to cross-sell into existing clients as well as leading new logos for EPAM. So going forward, we expect to continue improving our hybrid capabilities to help clients innovate and outperform their competition. However, I would stress that it's still too early to quantify direct effect of this efforts. And as we shared last time, we have a long-term view and believe that continuous innovation, constant result evaluation and, if necessary, real-time adjustment to the process is a fast forward rather than a specific phase of doing business. Now I would like to take a minute to come back to an important milestone in our history. As I mentioned today, in December last year, we celebrated our 20th anniversary as a company. I would like to say thank you to all of our employees, our clients and our partners who enabled our success, and to our investors who continue to believe in us. It was very difficult to predict that it would be possible to grow from nothing back in '93 to today over 10,000 people with several hundred clients around the world. While we went through 2 large economic downturns and many technology shifts during those years, I would like to stress one more time that we started this company by helping our customers to bring to life complex, mission-critical, software solutions at a time when the market wasn't ready to accept services from the tiny company with small presence in Eastern Europe. We took in [indiscernible] some clients to try them, and that allowed us to start the journey. Today, when the market demands providers to deliver such solutions, we continue to benefit significantly from those 20 years of strong software-engineering focus. Coupled with the fast-developing new capabilities we talked about today and our historical focus on innovation, it will allow us to continue to position EPAM as a strong partner for the future. I would like now to turn over to Anthony to discuss our performance and provide more financial details. Over to you, Anthony.
Anthony J. Conte: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to spend a few minutes talking -- taking you through the fourth quarter and full year results, and then I will talk about our 2014 outlook. As usual, the full details of our results can be found in our press release and the quarterly fact sheet located on the Investors section of our website. As detailed in our press release, our fourth quarter revenues grew 25.5% over last year and 12.4% sequentially to $157.6 million, above the top end of our guidance. For the full year, revenues grew 28% to $555.1 million, coming in above our guidance. The revenue overperformance was driven by our ability to successfully complete projects ahead of schedule, combined with new client acquisitions at the end of the year. Looking at service lines, we experienced no significant change in our revenue mix. Software development and application testing services continue to be our largest service offerings in both the fourth quarter and the full year 2013. For the full year, North America represented 50.8% of revenue, up 36.2%; Europe was up 36.1%, representing 29% growth over prior year; and CIS represented 11.7% of revenue. Within CIS, Russia grew 12.3% and represents approximately 10% of revenue. Revenues from other locations in CIS declined due to the completion of a onetime project in 2012. Our growth continues to be fueled by new clients and deeper penetration into existing accounts. Our top 20 clients accounted for 56.9% of total revenues and grew 23.8%, while all clients below the top 20 grew 34.3% year-over-year. Our customer loyalty remains high with 94% of customers working for us at least a year and 78% coming from those who have been with us for 2 years or more. We talked about growing new clients into significant relationships and we were successful in this effort during 2013. In 2012, we had 81 clients that generated at least $1 million in revenues. For 2013, that number increased more than 17% to 95 clients. Each of our verticals grew in excess of 20% year-over-year, led by banking and financial services, our fastest-growing vertical, increasing 39.7% from the prior year and representing 28.2% of our 2013 revenues. ISV & Technology grew 26.3% in 2013 and accounted for 24.3% of the total revenue. Travel and consumer increased 22.2% and was 21.1% of revenue. In addition, during 2013, we managed to reverse the negative growth trend in the business information and media vertical that had been caused by declining revenues from Thomson Reuters. This vertical regained growth momentum and was up 21.3% in 2013, accounting for 13.6% of total revenue. GAAP income from operations increased 24.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013 when compared to 2012, and 14.6% sequentially, to represent 14.7% of revenue. For the full year, GAAP income from operations grew 15.9%, representing 13.8% of revenue. Included in our operating results on a GAAP basis were stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of purchased intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and certain other onetime items that we exclude from our non-GAAP measures. Full details on these items can be found in our press release. Non-GAAP income from operations increased 33.2% over the prior year to $27.4 million, representing 17.4% of revenues. For the full year, non-GAAP income from operations grew 22.6% to $91.8 million or 16.5% of revenues. GAAP net income increased 25.1% in the fourth quarter of 2013. And for the full year, GAAP net income grew 13.8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income grew 38.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013 when compared to 2012 and 13.9% sequentially. For the full year, non-GAAP net income increased 22.3% compared to guidance of 15% to 20%. We completed the year with 9,340 IT professionals, an increase of 10% compared to 2012. And combined with a 2% increase in utilization, bringing it to 76%, supported the 28% growth in revenues. For the quarter, we generated $0.48 of non-GAAP EPS, also above the top end of our guidance, and $0.38 of GAAP EPS. For the full year, we generated non-GAAP EPS of $1.66 and GAAP EPS of $1.28. During the fourth quarter and full year 2013, we had approximately 49.1 million and 48.4 million diluted shares outstanding, respectively. Diluted share count for both the fourth quarter and the full year increased by over 2 million shares mainly due to employee stock option grants and exercises as well as stock issued in connection with our 2012 acquisitions. Turning to our balance sheet. We finished the year with approximately $169 million of cash, up approximately $46.2 million from September 30. During the fourth quarter, operating activities generated approximately $46.4 million of cash, and full year 2013 free cash flow almost doubled to $42.3 million. Unbilled revenues were at $43 million at December 31, an increase of $9.7 million compared to prior year. Of this increase, approximately 75% was attributable to services rendered in November and December to our 2 largest accounts. In January, we subsequently billed $29 million of the total unbilled revenue. Accounts receivable were at $95 million at the end of Q4, up 21% from last year. And DSO ended the year at 55 days, flat with last year. Before I share guidance, and for modeling purposes, I would like to highlight that we will be continuing to make strategic investments into the business, as we have over the past year. These investments are included within the guidance numbers I will share shortly. I would like to remind everyone that, historically, our year contains seasonal pattern, with Q1 being our softest quarter followed by sequential growth through the balance of the year. Q1 is typically our slowest due to Russian holidays in January and the short month of February. In addition, all annual salary increases are processed in Q1, creating a squeeze in margins that improves over the year. Turning to our guidance. For the full year 2014, based on current conditions, EPAM expects year-over-year revenue growth to be 21% to 23%. Non-GAAP net income growth for 2014 is expected to be in the range of 18% to 20% year-over-year, with an effective tax rate of 20%. The full year weighted average share count is expected to be just over 50 million diluted shares outstanding. For the first quarter of 2014, EPAM expects revenues between $151 million and $153 million, representing a growth rate of 21.6% to 23.2% over first quarter 2013 revenues. First quarter 2014 non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.41 based on an estimated first quarter 2014 weighted average of 49.6 million diluted shares. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.28 to $0.31. I would now like to turn the call back over to Arkadiy. Ark?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Anthony, and we would like to, before we start with the questions, to address clearly critical issue, which probably everybody worry about, the situation in Ukraine. And it's, as we all understand, very difficult and sad situation, to say the least, and our thoughts go to the people who were injured or killed and to their families there. To understand what impact it having on EPAM, first of all, we have about 2,600 engineers in Ukraine, and 1,500 of them are in Kyiv in several office buildings. Fortunately for us, those offices not in close proximity to any of the main government buildings in Kyiv, basically pretty far from the site of the main events, which you might be seeing on TV. So to this point, we didn't experience any interruption in our office infrastructure, in utility supply, in Internet, power and so on. And we don't anticipate any -- the scenario that would cause infrastructure interruption at this point. So all EPAM offices remain open and fully functional, including those we support several large financial clients, which is operating 24/7. However, the closure of main public transportation, the metro, by the government makes it difficult or sometimes impossible for us to have to get into the office. We definitely considered such situation during the last couple of months, and many of our teams were already configured to be securer access, either which relied on EPAM infrastructure or directly client infrastructure. And those measures allow them to work from home. So we are managing the situation in real time and clearly making some decisions in real time right now to make sure -- to address any concern for staff safety and to make sure that people will be capable to return home safely in a situation of worsened. We also allocated additional staff and additional equipment to build and strengthen our capacity for remote communication, for VPN, for any secure communication methods. So today, we have close to 50% of our people in the office. Yesterday, it was closer to 60%. And we have another 40%, 45% of people connected and working with a client project by secure VPN. So basically, at this point, we experiencing about under 10% drop in productivity in Kyiv. No any interruptions in other offices in Ukraine. We continue to monitor situation closely to understand if it would be necessary to execute any other specific plans for all contingencies. And we also consider in these plans very closely to specific account situation because there are different requirements in different situations. To this point, project continue to move forward, and we really appreciate our clients' understanding and support in this situation. So with this, I would like to turn back to operator to start Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Moshe Katri of Cowen and Company.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Maybe you can talk a bit about guidance. Give us some more color here. If you look at the -- at calendar year 2014, what's embedded in terms of adjusted EBIT margins for the year? And then how do we expect the revenues to flow on a quarterly basis throughout the year?
Anthony J. Conte: Moshe, thanks. The revenue component flow should be very similar to what you've seen in past years. As I mentioned in my initial comments, Q1 is typically our slowest and then we ramp slowly over the course of the year, with Q4 being our strongest revenue quarter. So I would expect a very similar pattern to prior years as far as the revenue flow. And as far as the second part of it, you asked what was embedded within EBITDA. Are you referencing the investment?
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: The investment of EBIT margins. What sort of EBIT margin assumptions do you have in the model for calendar year 2014?
Anthony J. Conte: We're expecting kind of adjusted EBITDA margins to be roughly in the 18% to 19%, which is historically where we've existed.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then if you look at Q1, is there anything specific that would -- because it seems that the revenue numbers are within what we're looking for but then your adjusted EPS are a bit lower. Is there anything that would actually change your EBIT margin or EBIT adjusted -- adjusted EBIT margins for Q1 from where it has been historically?
Anthony J. Conte: Well, historically, I think our Q1 for 2014 is actually relatively in line with other Q1 performance. So there's nothing specific to highlight that's different. It's just that Q1 is a quarter that just deals with a little bit of a squeeze because we do have a lighter revenue quarter and we put in effect annual raises, so we just feel that normal squeeze. If you look at it, it's fairly consistent with Q1s in previous periods. It's not -- from a margin perspective, it's not that dramatically off.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Understood. And then last question. For Q4, you had a pretty big ramp from your top clients and then from your top 5 customers. The rest of the business obviously didn't grow as fast. Maybe you can give us some color on that?
Anthony J. Conte: The...
Arkadiy Dobkin: [indiscernible].
Anthony J. Conte: The Q4 ramp did come from some of our larger clients. We saw a Q4 push to complete some projects. We brought in some new clients in Q4 that ramped up faster than we anticipated. And that was really the drive behind the increased revenue in Q4. And I think when you look at it, the top clients versus the other, the top clients are the ones that ramped faster. It's just a function of the mathematics. They ramped up a little quicker so we saw more of an uptick from them, and the other clients just continued to trend as they had throughout the rest of the year.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: And should that -- should we assume that, that kind of reverses itself a bit throughout this year?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It's definitely very difficult to say right now. So -- and we understand that it's kind of similar to last year's situation. But at this point, we cannot say that anything like this would be happening or not.
Operator: The next question is from Mayank Tandon of Needham & Company.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: So I just wanted to look at some of the key metrics here. Maybe, Anthony or Ark, if you could just share where utilization came in, in the fourth quarter? What your expectations are for 2014? And also, how should we think about hiring over the course of the year to hit your revenue growth targets?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So utilization trend is -- were kind of -- were changing during the year, and it's 2013 where it's basically a function of what was happening with us in 2012, where our bench reached pretty significant levels because, like, all our training capacity were working at full, and plus what was happening with Thomson Reuters during that 2012, when it was still very aggressively downsizing. So what's happened in 2013 is that we had an opportunity to utilize bench, which builds up and then -- at the beginning actually of this last year. And if you will track our increase in headcount quarter-by-quarter you will see that, while our utilization was going up in Q4, at the same time the number of new employees were much higher in Q4 in comparison with Q3 or Q2. So we basically worked to bring more people to the company and utilization during the year will be maintaining around 76%, 78%.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. So just to be clear, utilization is going to be -- remain consistent with what it was in 2013 and then it'll really be hiring and then maybe some price increases that will provide the revenue?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, we're always -- we're maintaining the bench because if you put in staff for new projects internally, usually not hiring just for that specific opportunity but would like to make sure that we have a reliable team to start new projects. So basically, we're going to hire. We probably will be a little bit higher utilization rate than average for the last year, but it wouldn't be at 80%.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then maybe we can get some thoughts around attrition rates in your business as you finish 2013? And also, what is the expectation for wage inflation that is embedded in your model?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. So let me answer on attritions. Attritions for our actual operations was -- voluntary attrition around 11%, which is a little bit -- maybe a little bit higher than last year, maybe 1%, but generally in line with expectations. And in regards to wage inflation, I'll pass it to...
Anthony J. Conte: Yes. Wage inflation for 2013 was running roughly at 9%, 10%, and we're building into the model roughly a similar trend for 2014. So we expect to keep wage inflation right within that band.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just finally on pricing. I know in the past you talked about pricing increments, I believe, in the mid to high single digits. Is that something you saw in 2013? And then what is the expectation for 2014?
Anthony J. Conte: Yes, pricing was roughly right around 8% that we saw in 2013, and we're modeling roughly about the same going forward, possibly a little bit higher. But the range that we keep is roughly in that 6% to 8% range from a modeling perspective.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays.
Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I just want to go back for a moment to the situation in Ukraine. Can you give us a little more understanding? Are clients giving you any feedback? Is there any -- has there been any response from clients on new work? And then in terms of your hiring plan, maybe a little bit more specifics on the numbers in general? I might have missed that in the question -- in the answer before. And how the plan in terms of hiring is going to shape up around where you go for hiring given, again, what's happening in Ukraine right now?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So the -- like in Ukraine, clearly clients who operate in there are going [indiscernible]. And we have constant communication and update with them. So one of the key member of our management team, Karl Robb, he located in Kyiv. So he has very close touch on situation. He lives, like, probably much closer to the main kind of event field than our offices. But again, we communicate constantly with clients and are providing updates. So some clients allowed -- formally actually offer us to move some people to working from home and help us to provide infrastructure necessary from their side. So we have kind of very good level of partnership cooperation with the clients right now. So how it affected the revenue or future work? It's very difficult to say. We didn't see much from existing clients that something changed. So clearly, during the last 2 days, situation become less predictable. We hope that it would be still be stabilizing during the next week. But again, this is -- we can evaluate only real time. So in regards to hiring people, we still plan to hire in Ukraine. We still plan to hire in Belarus, Russia, Poland and Hungary. So all these countries where we have locations today is growing. We will have to evaluate the situation again in regards to Ukraine in next weeks. But I don't -- we don't believe that it would affect any long-term plans for us.
Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And I may have missed it, but did you mention anything about number of employees or number of net additions throughout 2014? I know there's -- sometimes you've said for -- on a quarterly basis what you've done, but have you mentioned anything going forward?
Anthony J. Conte: Are you talking forecast? Or are you talking what our net hires were in 2013?
Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Well, I guess relative to 2013, what you're expecting for '14?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we expect around 16%, 17% headcount growth.
Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division: All right, that's helpful. And just one follow-up question. In terms of -- on that topic, in terms of the type of people you hired throughout 2013, I know a lot of them -- you were -- there was a pretty real goal of building out non-engineering personnel, a lot more around senior relationship management. Can you talk to some of that? And has that been successful? Has that helped with new business generation with some of your key clients?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, I can give you some color on this. Yes, we have some very good success and we have some disappointments, which, I guess, normal. So -- and increase in business development was visible. But also, hiring the senior staff, for us, was very important to grow existing accounts. So we brought -- as I mentioned, we brought a good number of people from industries with very strong domain expertise in financial services and capital markets space. We brought number of people in retail and consumer vertical, as well. Also, we brought many strong technologies with client-facing capabilities, as I mentioned also, which extremely important for us because we have very good engineers globally but sometimes we have kind of the difficulties and a real gap between what they can do in offshore and actually how this links and communicated to our clients. So that was one of the important, for us, area of focus and specifically around all these competencies which we talked. So I think it's really proved to us that it should work. And I think that this kind of case study, which I was using this morning, is very good illustration of direction which we're going to continue. Because that's exactly combination, when you have strong enough on-site presence, new -- actually, new people which were hired even this year on technology competency were helping to bring this account to the level which is right now.
Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Just one last follow-up and I'll go back to the queue. In terms of the areas of growth that are going to be sort of above company average in your guidance, your guidance being sort of -- I'll call it, top line, 19%, 20%. If -- which verticals are you expecting to outperform? Which verticals should we look to being slightly slower than that? Maybe specifically what's happening around telecommunications also? And then I'll turn it back.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Around telecommunication, we -- I don't think we work in telecommunication right now.
Anthony J. Conte: And it's probably...
Arkadiy Dobkin: So it's very, very, very small portion of our business in other category. So -- but at this point, we expect that all 3 industry verticals will be growing pretty significantly for us. You saw last year all of them were growing over 20%, and that's an expectation for this year, too.
Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. I guess the -- what I was referring to is more business and media kind of area, specifically.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay, Business Information & Media. Yes, this was interesting year because, several years ago, majority of Business Information & Media, it was Thomson Reuters. And during 2011 and '12, it really kind of went down and brought the whole vertical with them. But as you can see, this year we're starting to grow back and Reuters actually itself is starting to grow back. So this is the second quarter in a row when we're growing with Reuters. Now we have pretty high expectations here.
Operator: We have no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, everyone, again. So it was a very good year for EPAM and clearly with a lot of challenges. And you see that the challenges may come in sometimes very unexpectedly. So we hope that they kind of will work it over and the situation in Ukraine would improve. So thank you, again, and talk to you in a few months. Thank you.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the EPAM Systems Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ilya Cantor, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you, Mr. Cantor, you may begin.
Ilya Cantor: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2013 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, epam.com. The speakers on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, Chief Executive Officer; Ilya Cantor, Chief Financial Officer; and Anthony Conte, VP of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call, and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Arkadiy Dobkin. Ark, please go ahead.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Ilya, and good morning, everyone. EPAM third quarter performance was strong, ahead of our original guidance for the quarter and at the top end of our updating guidance from October 8. Third quarter revenue was $140 million, a year-on-year increase of 27.3% and a sequential increase of 5.2%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 17%, in the middle of our target range of 16% to 18%. Our results reflect growth across all vertical services and geographies. As we continue to invest in and strengthen our client base and organization, we see some improvement in both penetration of existing accounts and the quality of our pipeline. However, it's still very early to quantify direct effect of these efforts. So we have a long-term view here and do believe that continuous innovation, constant result evaluation and, if necessary, realtime adjustment to the process is the way of doing business rather than a specific phase. Next month in December, it will be 20 years of EPAM doing business. While a lot has changed during those 2 decades, our core principle remains intact. This is a commitment to delivering relevant engineered complex software solutions and information technology services to our clients. When we started, it's mostly on the independent software vendors and technology-oriented companies who are interested in our work. High-quality standards demanded by those clients helped us very much to advance in the field and to support a strong engineering culture in the company. Eventually, those capabilities opened new doors for us to the larger corporate world. The world during the last decade become so much dependent on software and digital way of doing business, we had to turn to a relatively small numbers of vendors capable at scale to deliver critical business solutions, utilizing new emerging technologies with a commercial-grade software quality. Over the last years, we acquired a new set of skills and capabilities in order to complement our engineering focus and to deliver much more sophisticated and more business-oriented software solutions. As a result, we still have the same core principle: Enduring commitment to delivering well-engineered complex software solutions and information technology services. But now, we benefit already different and the most demanding set of clients, those who operate with a threshold operation in new digital era [ph]. As in the past, we are very dedicated to transform the company to continue recruiting in line with our core principle and our client commitment. So it's very encouraging during this anniversary year to see high level of recognition of our approach. Throughout the month, EPAM was named #6 on the Forbes annual list of American Best Small Public Companies. The list, which includes public companies with revenue under $1 billion. Also, EPAM was #2 on 20 fast-growing tech start-up list on this rating. If you remember, earlier this year, EPAM was included also in Forbes list of America 25's 5 fastest-growing technology companies, underscoring the company's status as one of the most rapidly developing software, engineering and IT-consulting companies in America. Our ability to continue delivering this kind of industry-leading growth is good affirmation of the strength of our approach and capabilities. Our recently increased guidance was partially driven by a solid quarter in Banking & Financial Services, which grew 33% year-over-year, with particular strong performance from investment banking clients in Europe. Key demand is growing in line with increased adoption of new technologies by many financial institutions to differentiate themselves in the highly digitized world. A good example is one of our clients in Tier 1 investment bank. Our relationship has progressed over the past several years from participating in cost-optimization initiatives in the beginning to becoming an improvement technology partner and now to a more trusted strategic relationship. This covers a substantial amount of innovation work and change [ph] of bank work, which includes mobile, cloud, big data and complex analytics service, as well as user experience design initiative, which has strong potential to transform into a sizable and critical for the business new engagement. We also established variations in several new locations in the Asia-Pacific region at the request of our client, which means that we are able to expand to new product geographies, is a less risk we've been doing that in greenfield way. Our other clients in Banking & Finance are increasing their spending in similar transformational activities, aimed at not only saving money, but also changing how they go to market, how they interact with their customers, how they manage their regulatory compliance, risk management and a host of other problems. Business & Financial Services also is good illustration of our investment that we've talked about during this year. We significantly strengthened the team with very senior talent coming from the industry to accumulate necessary level of business knowledge in our site and to provide such leadership in our engagements. By the way, just recently, the Everest Group recognized EPAM as 2013 Capital Markets Star Performer for the second year in a row. And this is only 5 from 20 asset providers that received the star performer status. ISVs & Technology has solid performance, growing by 22.6% to 24.4% of total revenue. We had positive new account acquisitions both between actual results of our company, as well as several new technology start-ups. With continuing independent liquidization of our expertise on this segment, EPAM was recognized in Zinnov's Global R&D Service Provider Ratings for 2013 as a Leading Consumer Software Service Provider and the Leading Software/ISV R&D Service Provider in the consumer and the software categories, respectively. Business Information & Media grew by 29%. However, if you exclude the impact of the decline in Thomson Reuters from last year, the segment increased 64%. This is the first time, during the last year, when Thomson Reuters started to grow again, and as a result, Business Information & Media showed 8% sequential growth during this period. Within the vertical, we're also benefiting from the impact of our strong integrated set of skills in Enterprise Mobility, complex web content management solutions, data analytics, digital strategy and user experience design. Retail and Consumer had healthy growth of 24% this quarter, helped by strong expansion with several client accounts, as well as by a number of new clients acquired this year, in particular in Europe. For example, in Retail, we won the one of the Europe's largest nutritional supplement supplier, one of UK's largest home improvement retailers, one of the largest [indiscernible] retailers and leading U.K.-based special discourse retailer. Several good deals for this year in hospitality including a U.K.-based luxury hotel chain, a middle Scandinavian tour operator and national air carrier. Clients in this sector are either the forefront of fastest moving changes in technology, in mobility and e-channel [ph] commerce, digital marketing, big data, analytics and cloud. Our understanding is important to the industry business solutions, to get the result by the experts in new technologies and being reassured to major European customers in this segment, continues to result in market share gains for EPAM in Europe. Another important trend in this segment is spending control by the business and specifically by CMOs. While there is continued pressure to control CIO budgets, spending by CMOs on product leadership is typically aimed to support revenue growth, which makes it incremental to IT budgets in total. Recognizing the importance of this, we are focusing on cultivating a relationship at multiple points in enterprise and continuing investment in client-facing abilities and deeper business understanding. Moving on to our performance by geography. We had better-than-expected performance in North America, which increased 34% year-over-year and 5% -- 5.7% sequentially. This is mostly driven by growth within key accounts in ISVs & Technology, Retail and Consumer and Business Information & Media vertical. These segments are particularly sensitive to dramatic changes in technologies, and EPAM is ideally positioned to benefit from this. Europe once again had solid and consistent growth now at 36% of total revenues with revenue growth of 25% year-over-year and 6.2% sequential. As I already mentioned here, Banking & Finance grew well, also as stated, Retail and Consumer in Europe benefited from strong new client activity. CIS showed moderate growth this quarter year-over-year. Here you also have the benefit of 2 significant e-commerce initiatives as retailers in Russia are ramping up investments on modern omni channel commerce platform, and we are in exceptional position to have base on our Expedia technology in Europe and North America. Our results this quarter once again showed our clients are allowing us to help them cope with today's disruptive innovations and cyclical economic pressures. If you were to sum what we have seen in the business long term. Technology, or the developing applications, is changing following the way how those applications are being consumed. Clients are facing a variety of pressures both global and more specific to the industry of their own operations. New digital business models are forcing companies to change the way they trade. Helped by strong discretionary spending, we continue to see an increase in spending aimed at adapting a software-to-service model. To that end today, we, first of all, help our clients move into the cloud by re-architecture, re-platforming and rebuilding their applications to utilize the power of this model. ISVs and our technology customers have been experiencing results -- that for a long time. Our long history of helping the clients with such efforts allowed us to be very early adapters of those trends and to develop strong skills and expertise to engineer cloud-capable solutions, as well as comfortably work in the cloud environment. All of that position us well to support our corporate customers, moving in the same direction, where the size of cloud transition applications will also help to build fully functional, scalable public/private [indiscernible] clouds, as well as providing all key aspects of related dev app services. Because of complex nature, the majority of our work and our very little share of traditional for the industry production wins in support of legacy platforms, we view the revenue opportunity from cloud adoption by our existing clients as incremental. In other words, we don't see any decrease in spending on our services when our clients move to the cloud. As we mentioned before to capitalize on this opportunity, we are continually investing in developing right skills, partnerships and infrastructure, including establishing through multi-tenant private cloud for all our external operations. This environment has been up and running for some time, and we have seen today numerous benefits, which we could now with full confidence offer to our clients. To conclude, we continue to focus on maintaining our leading position in complex software engineering services and solutions market, which contribute our ability to grow above the industry average. Our results this quarter once again show that our deep industry technology knowledge, our sophisticated global delivery platform position EPAM well to deliver the services to our clients who need to deal with in today's highly disruptive shift in technology and new digitally driven business models. Now, I will turn it to Anthony who will review the financials.
Anthony J. Conte: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to spend a few minutes taking you through our third quarter results and then I will talk about our fourth quarter outlook. As usual, the full details of our results can be found in our press release and the quarterly fact sheet located on the Investors section of our website. As detailed in our press release, our third quarter revenue grew 5.2% sequentially and 27.3% over last year to $140.2 million, at the top end of our updated guidance. On a constant-currency basis, revenues would be up 4.9% sequentially and 27.7% over last year. Our non-GAAP net income grew 21% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. For the quarter, we generated $0.43 of non-GAAP EPS, also at the top end of our guidance, and $0.34 of GAAP EPS. SG&A, excluding stock compensation and acquisition-related expenses, was 18.6% of revenue for the quarter, slightly above the 18.3% from Q3 last year, but down from the 19.3% in the preceding quarter. Non-GAAP income from operations increased to 24.2% over prior year to $23.8 million, representing 17% of revenues, right within our 16% to 18% target range. Diluted share count for the quarter has increased by 2.2 million shares to 48.7 million from the same quarter last year, mainly due to stock option exercises by employees and acquisition consideration. Looking at service lines. We experienced no significant changes in our revenue mix. Software development services continues to be our largest service offering, growing 27% over last year and representing 67% of revenues. Testing was 19.8% of revenues, or 26% growth over last year. And maintenance and support was 8.4% of revenues or 33.5% over last year. Infrastructure services increased by 16.8% to 2.7% of revenues. Our growth continues to be fueled by deeper penetration into existing accounts, while also consistently adding new customers to our mix. Customer concentration remains healthy with our top 20 clients accounting for 57.7% of total revenues and growing 23.3% while all clients below the top 20 grew 32.5%. Barclays remains our top customer and accounts for 10.2% of revenues. Our customer loyalty remains high with 93% of customers working for us as at least 1 year, compared to 89% 1 year ago. And 79% coming from those who have been with us for 2 years or more, compared to 76% last year. Turning to our balance sheet. We finished the third quarter with approximately $123 million of cash, up by approximately $15.5 million for the quarter ending June 30. During the third quarter, operating activities generated approximately $15.6 million of cash. Unbilled revenues were at $65 million at September 30, compared to $33.4 million at December 31, in line with normal quarterly trends. And in October, we subsequently built $25 million of that unbilled. Accounts receivable were at $87.6 million at the end of Q3, up 11% from year end. DSOs for the quarter was at 58 days compared to 59 days last quarter. IT professional headcount increased 11.5% over last year to 9,065, supporting our 27% revenue growth. Our utilization and bench management continue to improve, and we continue to see favorable pricing environment. Turning to our guidance for the full year 2013. We feel very comfortable with the guidance we provided 4 weeks ago. Our business development activity and pipeline continue to be strong, and we are seeing lots of positive indicators from our largest accounts. As such, for the full year, we are reiterating our prior guidance of revenue growth to $542 million to $545 million. Adjusted earnings growth is expected to be in the range of 15% to 20% year-over-year with an effective tax rate of 19%. For the fourth quarter of 2013, EPAM expects revenue between $144 million and $147 million, representing a growth rate of 15% to 18% over fourth quarter 2012 revenues. Fourth quarter 2013 non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.44 to $0.47 based on an estimated fourth quarter 2013 weighted average of 49.2 million diluted shares. We would now like to open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: The color was very helpful, but Ark and Anthony, could you maybe give us a sense of what are you're hearing from your customers in terms of budget levels from 2014 and how the priorities might be different from what you saw in 2013?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you. It's Arkadiy. So, as usual, at this time of the year, clearly some conversation rate has started, but I think it would be too early to disclose any specifics. So I know that this sounds kind of boring, but all I can say is that we don't see much change at least in our situation from the previous years. We see approximately similar levels of visibility, we saw like year ago at the same time. So no kind of very good surprises, no any great news as well. So we probably will be able to answer this question much better during the next call.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Sure. Let me ask you this, though. In terms of the size and scope of opportunities that you're seeing, is that different from what you may have seen 12 months ago? Then, also, maybe you could comment on how your win rate is tracking directionally versus some of the larger global IT services peers that you might be competing against in specific opportunities.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, a little bit back to your previous questions what type of opportunities. We do see a lot of interest in this. We're still all seeing new technologies for the last couple of years, but it's still relatively new, like, mobile, compass [ph], e-Commerce and portal applications, so analytics, big data implementation from scalability point of view, so cloud deployment. It's all becoming much and much more visible for us. And we invest in a lot of in this area to provide to the clients what they're looking for. So this engagement increasing proportionally in our case. So from the -- again, statistically, it would be very difficult for me to kind of quantify any specific win rates, but I -- we do see a lot of situations where we need to combine our capabilities in U.S. [ph] in digital strategies with our portal skills and mobile extensions to win new type of deals in comparison with just a couple of years ago. And we compete in these deals with very large competitors, top companies in the world and we're seeing some good rate of winning for ourselves. Again, I cannot quantify this specifically.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then one final question on the cost front. Just give us a sense of what the recruiting environment looks like in your key delivery markets, and then what should we think about in terms of attrition rates and wage inflation levels going forward.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So recruitment is not easy stuff, easy process for ourselves, because competition is growing. And again, it sounds kind of I'm repeating myself, but we mentioned this all problem on all our previous calls. Competition for good talent is very, very tough all around the world starting from San Francisco going to New York, switching to Europe, Western Europe and Eastern Europe. So it is one of the biggest challenges for any technology company. And as we understand like [indiscernible] doesn't help here. So our attrition rates are pretty much in line with our historical numbers. For the whole year, right now, it's approaching a rate approximately a little bit lower than 12%. And wage inflation probably is the same area. And that's exactly what was historically in our numbers, and that's what we are approximately expect in the future.
Operator: Our next questions from the line of Steve Milunovich of UBS.
Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Could you talk a bit about your hiring plans going forward? And I believe you've had stronger growth in non-billable workers than billable, is that expected to continue or to change?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It's a very, very, very slight difference, and also during the last multiple quarter, we're talking that we need to improve our client-facing capabilities. And with the type of projects which we see, and which we mentioned before, we need different ratio of onshore, offshore. And specifically, people with strong business understanding and strong account management functions, which were like in the past -- and again, we were talking about it openly over the last couple of years. So basically that's why some number of unbillable people were increasing a little bit faster. So if it will continued during the next quarters, probably very -- it would be very similar to what we're seeing today. So when you'll find exactly balance necessary for success, we kind of -- we will define it based on experience and see the output of our work.
Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then regarding the comments about new technology and the cloud, first of all, can you quantify at all how much of your business is SaaS-related or new technology-related? Number two, why do you think you don't lose any kind of older legacy business as you move to the new technologies? And three, when you're doing cloud deployments, are those primarily private clouds or do you get involved in some public cloud work as well?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So as we mentioned, this is what we've seen from clients' conversations and opportunities. And also, as we stated, majority today of the cloud work relates to our engineering skills to build applications capable to work in cloud with all possible requirements. So there is no very strong numbers right now to -- again, to illustrate it because in development and engineering portion of this, it's very difficult to separate what's exactly going to cloud-specific work or not. But if you look at the applications as a whole, it's a different architecture usually. And if you think about the 24% of our current from IT and technology, majority of the work is done there now engineered in very different way. Again -- and that it was our main point. At the same time, there is movement to the cloud. And in our case, mostly we're helping clients with establishing production kind of environment for cloud development, in private cloud for engineering process, for continuous integration and continuous development. That's what we build for the whole company internally, and that's we actually explaining to a number of clients how to get benefits from this. And we've seen some increase in deluxe services as well, which provided completely different level of flexibility and kind of flexibility to the clients. So if you're asking me for specific numbers, no, I cannot give you any specific split.
Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: That's fine. And finally, you've indicated you're getting positive indications from your large accounts in terms of business going forward. Can you talk a bit more about what those indications are?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I didn't say that -- I am saying that we've seen very similar indication as in previous years. So I don't see that indication is more positive this year than it was last year or even 1 year ago. Clearly, it's much more positive than it was in 2009.
Operator: Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays.
Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just want to start off, first, one of the obvious efforts you guys have been making is to hire more senior relationship management-type personnel to really, really work with your best and largest clients. And specifically, people that are probably more technologically capable than the average senior relationship person that you might see at your competitors. How difficult is that process? How's it going? Have you hired any kind of key people that might help you grow these larger clients even faster?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. As we mentioned today already that one of the focuses -- and we have pretty good progress in our Banking & Financial Services, where we brought to the company multiple very senior managers from the industry. And we've seen how it's changing our capability to offer different type of services and deliver kind of -- and lead some of new type of engagements. Similarly, what's happening right now in Travel and Hospitality business units, we're looking for people. We've hired some, but it's not enough. And the same happening in Business Information & Media. Also, we're starting to create special group, kind of strategic groups for business development activities, and we're very seriously improving our leadership in Technology in our CTO [ph] office and capabilities there around multiple competencies, which we consider very strategic for us. So again, let's -- coming back to the ratio of unbillable people. So we bring in some people, which focusing how to accumulate knowledge, how to distribute knowledge, how to manage clients better. So it's a very key effort for us.
Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And so where is that process? Are you around 30% or 40% through that process now?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think you also try to address it in -- during kind of our conversation order. So we are not trying to model this, now it's 30% complete or 40% complete. So this is kind of step by step and verification process. When we do one step, we're seeing what the impact of this. Because if impact is very good, maybe it's never going to be finished. So it's a multiple kind of cycles, small cycles, where we see what would be the next one.
Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division: All right. Could you just kind of talk a little bit more about, more broadly, your hiring efforts and what opportunity is there? I know you mentioned earlier that it's competitive, obviously. But you get 11% growth, I think, in personnel right now and, I guess, what we're trying to figure out is, when you look at your future growth rate and where utilization rates are, give us the moving parts on how you're going to work through your headcount needs for next year when you're growing materially lower than your revenue growth rate now.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay, sure. I was hoping that we will give chance to Anthony to talk today on more financial stuff and kind of would be good to welcome to him. But it seems like I have to continue for now.
Anthony Conte: Yes, you're doing good.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. So, first of all, our strategy kind of in resource development always was very balance between hiring from the market experienced people and actually training people coming from the newer cities. So -- and we have pretty scalable infrastructure for training facilities. During the 2012, we put a lot of efforts to actually build up bench. And, for example, our utilization in Q4 last year, Q1 this year, were probably the lowest. And kind of clearly the bench were the largest bench during the last 3 years. So with this buildup, we've been able to kind of work in this year's result necessity to hire too many people. So we utilized bench. We kind of optimized it. And again, even today, our billable utilization around 75% for the year, which means that we have good capacity in our bench to grow. That's why hiring numbers kind of lower than our revenue growth, and it should be lower because there are some other attributes to this threshold, beside just utilization. As we were mentioning before, one of our goals were to increase onshore presence. And now our onshore presence, for example, is around 2.5% higher than last year. Also, there are annual growth in billing rates, and it's usually between, like, 6% and 8%. So when you calculate all this, this would explain what's happening. So from the future point of view, we continue to do exactly what we were doing in the past. We kind of accelerating training facilities. We, during this year, invested a lot in buildup very strong recruitment machine. So we brought, also, like we -- some expert from outside of the company who know how to build up recruitment with 1,000 people per year. So we feel that we have all components available for us to continue growing next year.
Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division: What's the appropriate utilization rate we should think about modeling longer term?
Arkadiy Dobkin: You mean for the future?
Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we should think about like 73%, 75%, probably, in the future as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I guess my first question is with regards to 4Q '12 last year. Can you remind us what the one-timers were and were they genuinely one-timers? Can you -- because part of that was a budget flush. Would you expect a similar budget flush this year with your clients, and so then last year would not be a one-timer in that regard?
Anthony J. Conte: Ashwin, it's Anthony here.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes, you can talk.
Anthony J. Conte: I can talk, yes, thank you. Thank you for that question, that gives me an opportunity to speak. As far as budget flush, as you know, the budget flush last year came very late in the fourth quarter. At this point, we are seeing some slight indications of budget flush, but really nothing material or significant. So we are not anticipating a recurrence of the flush that we saw last year. I mean, you remember last year was $10 million of flush that came very late in the fourth quarter. We're not seeing indications of that level or anything even close to that this year.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. So the implied growth rate for 4Q this year, we probably should be looking at adding back sort of the impact of that flush to figure out what a good ongoing rate is, is that what you're implying?
Anthony J. Conte: Yes, yes.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Is it a good exit rate? Okay, good, good. And with regards to -- a couple of the earlier questions have obviously tried to get to this gap between headcount growth and revenue growth. And there are multiple pieces clearly, there's utilization, which you guys just addressed, and there's pricing. And pricing, obviously, has 2 elements. One element is just wage inflation and charging clients a little bit more because of that. But the other element is increasing the headcount, client-facing people, in the U.S. and the U.K., which, obviously, carries higher billing rates with them. Can you talk about how you're proceeding with that one? I mean, you want to go, obviously, from 5% of your -- 5% to 7% of your employee base, at client, to roughly 10%. What's the impact of that?
Arkadiy Dobkin: What's the impact of these for the future, you mean?
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes.
Arkadiy Dobkin: It would be probably very similar to what's happening right now. For example, during the last year, we increased between 2% and 2.5% ratio between onshore and offshore. Probably during the next year, it will be similar growth, and we will come very close to 10%, which we're talking about. And it probably would -- now it's very, Ashwin, as you know, it's very difficult to quantify this in advance because, like, we don't have thousands of people on site, all right, so -- and basically, even a couple hundreds make a big impact on the ratios. And a couple hundreds with our size, it's not also a big umber to consider unreasonable, for example, in 6 months we will realize that for some clients, we will have to kind of expedite offsite presence and bring a couple hundreds more than we're anticipating today. So that's why it's, again, difficult to quantify. But at this point, we think that it will be similar to this year. The thing is we will have to hire more people because we will utilize the bench, which we built up in 2012, even in 2013. Next year, we will have to build up some bench again.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. I guess...
Arkadiy Dobkin: But even with all this, you understand that we have pretty good bench size currently, also. It's 75% utilization.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes, absolutely. And you do need that flexibility to grow, I understand that. The -- I guess the third part of growth is M&A. With regards to your M&A pipeline, how healthy is that? Should we look for something to happen here in the near term in the next 2, 3, 6 months?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Listen, you will find out as soon as everybody else will find out, right? Again boring, traditional answer here. So we're looking all the time. We have opportunities. We're hoping that during the next quarters, we will close some. But if it happens and when it happens, I cannot comment.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, got it. So last question is with regards to -- clearly, you guys are building an engine for the future in terms of getting all these people who can hire at industrial strength and recruit and all that kind of good stuff. And so the question sort of becomes, now that you have some of that built, with regards to hiring in Eastern Europe, they are sort of a little bit used to hiring in other geographies and what hiring cycle is another geographies. What's the hiring cycle look like in Eastern Europe? In order to grow next year at a reasonable rate, when would you need to hire these people?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So proper -- we start -- again, we're hiring all the time. We're not like really working in cycles. Even with what I mentioned before that we build up pretty sizable bench at the beginning of last year. And utilizing this, we still kind of wishing this all the time. Usually, when you find a person and give them the offer, it's kind of pretty global. So it could take like 1 month or so for a person to see the job. But again, we're not targeting just people from the market. We're investing a lot of special training center. I don't remember when we talked about it. We have program where people, even after coming to EPAM still -- more junior people, still on training from 3 to 6 months. So this is a lag, which we understand we have to kind of keep in mind when we're scaling up. So probably between these 2 parameters, bringing people from the market is probably months or 45 days. And when we bringing people from the university -- so even if already becoming our employees, it's still 3 to 6 months for internal training before they can go to production. So we're planning this in advance.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of David Grossman, Stifel.
David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I was just looking at the 3Q performance and your 4Q guidance, which would seem to suggest that the margins are migrating to a level towards the higher end of your target range. Do these margin levels fully reflect the investment spending that we've been talking about or perhaps is there some seasonality to the spend? And I guess, what I'm really getting at is, do these margin levels reflect a level that would be sustainable in the next year?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So all I could give you, again, some pretty fuzzy answer. So we designed our kind of future around 16%, 18%, as I mentioned. So is this specific number already reflect the investments which we did? This is where I would be cautious because this is again, experiment in process where we kind of relate what's right and what's wrong. So probably it would be too early to tell right now that this is already reflects. So most likely 4 quarters from now when we see consistency with this and we really would be able to kind of draw the connection between our actions and performance, we will be answering you more precisely. But I don't want to speculate that our investment will already show up. So -- but we do believe that we're investing in the right direction, and it will show up. Hopefully, sooner than later.
David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, fair enough. So second question I had is really on your maintenance model or maintenance revenue. I think you said it's about 8.5% of revenue. As the applications migrate to the cloud, does maintenance become more important or less important in your model in terms of the potential revenue stream down the road? Because your percentage of maintenance mix is, obviously, much lower than many of your competitors, and just curious whether this paradigm shift has an impact on that level whether either positively or negatively.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think we talked about this in the past, and it is an interesting thing and actually pretty complex answer to this question because like everything in our business, when you're saying application development or testing or maintenance and support, it has pretty broad meanings, and there are many variations of this. So general term, like maintenance and support, in our services industry usually means pretty sizable engagement for production activities around managing large legacy installed base. And this is, again, traditional understanding of this maintenance and support. And in this traditional sense, EPAM never had any sizable business. And even from this 8-plus percent we have today, it's probably just half of this would be qualified as a regular maintenance and support. Why it's happening because, yes, we were working mostly on new technology starts. We don't have, for example, any mainframe capabilities today. So -- and in this new technology start, maintenance and support is very different activity. Like if you think about -- and we also talked about SaaS model. If you think about the SaaS model, so the number of releases of the software is not like 1 per 6 months or even 1 per 3 months, it could be weekly or daily, multiple daily releases. So the line between maintenance and support and actually development of new features is very, very tight. So basically the team, which working on application is a combination of different set skills. So that's why it's very difficult to draw the line. And even inside of our 8%, 9%, which we stated, there is a big portion of this type of new maintenance and support work. And when we're saying that we don't see this, for example, deployment to the cloud would affect us, it exactly means that we're not losing the revenue in legacy production maintenance and support as many of our very large competitors probably will. And when clients move into this new model, they're actually looking for the company which have skills to make this support activities, kind of, a new environment. And we are very well positioned to do it, because that's what exactly we are already doing for long time for IT vendors and technology vendors. And even our corporate vendors, which is in reality, as we mentioned many times, in many senses, today technology companies, so even kind of not traditional software companies. So that's why we don't see that it's going to affect us. It's all actually an advantage.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Should we expect any major changes in tax policies or regulations in Belarus or Russia for next year? So can we get an update on that?
Anthony J. Conte: Moshe, at this point, we don't see any changes coming from any location as far as tax policy, and we pretty much expect a consistent tax environment going forward. So the answer is no, there's no change.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Tax holidays and some of the benefits will continue, the non-direction of this plant lease in the next few years.
Anthony J. Conte: Tax holiday is in place until...
Arkadiy Dobkin: '21.
Ilya Cantor: '21.
Anthony Conte: '21, 2021. So that should not change at all for the next 7, 8 years. And other jurisdictions' tax structures are pretty stable. We don't see any real changes. If anything, we're seeing some environment lowering their rates as the years go by. So we may see a little bit of some benefits from some jurisdictions, but nothing significant.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Great. And then, if I remember correctly -- talking about wage inflation, I think the Ukraine was probably an area of concern for you guys in the past. Any changes there in terms of wage inflation that we can get an update on what happened in the Ukraine so far this year? Maybe a same update about Belarus. And then maybe we can talk also about attrition rates in both of these locations so far this year.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So, Moshe, I actually don't remember that we were kind of more concerned about Ukraine versus other regions. I think we -- or I would say, I'm personally concerned about all the regions. And again, we're working towards how to mitigate it. And -- but it's the same concern, which we had previously. And this is like all this competition for talent is very tough all over the place, because the same problems in -- on the West Coast and in New York and in London. So I cannot distinguish this right now. So I don't think any significant differences between Belarus, Ukraine or even Russia right now. On attrition front, there are some slight differences between regions, but it's becoming more and more kind of balanced for year-after-year with the kind of we were growing much, much faster in Ukraine, and we started much, much later than in Belarus. So basically it was different now in Ukraine in size, practically coming to the level of Belarus. So it will come -- during the next 12 to 18 months, all these parameters becoming kind of more comparable as well.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Understood. And just last question -- and this is more related to demand trends and maybe you addressed it at the beginning of the call, just got in a bit late into the call. But what sort of feedback or comments are you getting from clients regarding their budgets next year? And then looking at your existing pipeline or new deal pipeline, which vertical/verticals are the most active?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. We -- it was probably one of the first questions, and we have our traditional answer and not because we'd like to give a traditional answer because that actually reflect the reality. So we don't see any differences in comparison with last year. Again with our size, as I mentioned before, $0.5 billion company, we don't see kind of different behavior from the clients than we were seeing during the last couple years. And I would say that all 3 verticals like Financial Services, Business Information & Media and Travel and Hospitality, we expect good level of growth there because that's -- again, that's the industries which we have to utilize new applications to be competitive in the market all the time. And we see pretty good interest from their side for our services. So I cannot even like distinguish some of them. So one quarter could be better. Financial Services still traditionally more stable, but we do believe that others will catch up as well.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of Nick Robinson of Renaissance Capital.
Nick Robinson - Renaissance Capital, Research Division: A quick question in relation to the cash balance. That's obviously picking up slightly over the years. And now, while there's still some potential M&A, assuming that's going to be small bolt ons, do we get to a point soon where you get beyond some excess cash? And if so, what sort of level would that be and what would you think about doing with that going forward?
Anthony J. Conte: As far as excess cash, I mean, we most likely will be using that cash to continue to reinvest into the business. We're constantly looking -- as we grow in the regions and add people, we constantly have a need for new facilities, so we're constantly looking at need for facilities. We're constantly looking at M&A. So a lot of those cash funds will be used in the M&A cycle, and that is our main intention, is really to continue to invest in facilities and M&A with that cash.
Operator: Our next question is from Ivan Belyaev with Sberbank.
Ivan Belyaev - Sberbank Investment Research: Yes. Well, I look at your adjusted operating profit for the third quarter and for the 9-month of the year, and it looks like your margins are like lowering a bit. So from your point of view, what's the main impact or what was the main impact for that? Is it that the hires of this year, staff or something -- some other costs?
Anthony J. Conte: Yes, I assume you're referring to the decline versus last year. And that is -- again, as we've kind of mentioned before, we're continually reinvesting into the business. And we are targeting the 16% to 18% range for those operating margins, adjusted operating margins. And we are going to continue to live within that space with those investments that we're making.
Ivan Belyaev - Sberbank Investment Research: And can you elaborate a bit on the investments, on what you mean about investing in the business? Or maybe major items or something.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. We -- again, it was probably a key topic for us during the old calls, previous calls. So we do invest in account management and business development operation, which was underinvested in the past. We invest in building very strong competencies inside of EPAM, and this requires dedicated people who's not billable, otherwise you cannot develop this. We invest in developing internal applications to optimize operation and management. We're replacing some systems which we built over the last 10, 15 years. And this is significant install base for us, and we do believe that it would actually bring additional differentiation who install the service. So there are multiple items, and that's what we mean by investment. And this is again, as we mentioned, continuous process. So when we will have upside from this, that was the question earlier today as well. We cannot give answer to you right now exactly. So we hope it will, and maybe kind of adjusting our actions based on what we see. So -- but this investment definitely was increased in comparison with last year and previous years as well.
Ivan Belyaev - Sberbank Investment Research: Okay, clear. And the next question regarding your verticals. The technology and ISV vertical, it grew 13% in the third quarter. I just wonder if this is sustainable, and what's going on within this vertical?
Arkadiy Dobkin: 23%.
Anthony J. Conte: The ISV in the third quarter actually grew 23% year-on-year, and it's pretty much in line with expectations. We've spoken about ISV vertical in the past. It's kind of the core of what we built our business on, and we expect to see it running at around -- right around the 25%-ish of -- percent of revenue.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So are you asking if we're thinking that it -- we will be growing in the future with the same 20%, 25% growth? Or like what can you...
Ivan Belyaev - Sberbank Investment Research: Yes, yes. The thing is, I saw that being, previously -- 3, 4 previous quarter, whereas it grew above 30%, and now it's lower. So I just wonder if this is -- how sustainable is that?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Again, as Anthony answered, we strategically would like to keep this to be a sizable part of our business between 20%, 25% of total revenue, which means that it should grow approximately with the same rate which we grow it. So -- and again, quarter-on-quarter, it clearly could vary, and that's very difficult to control. But long term, that's what we're quoting to support. At the same time, I do believe that -- you see, it's also very loaded question, because if you like to understand like detail what is ISVs & Technology and what is, for example, business with company like Expedia, which is travel, online travel. Is Expedia technology, client or not? We actually have these type of clients all over -- over all our verticals right now. So -- and ISV is more preferred to software companies, but it's also includes guys like Google and Zinnov. So -- but a simple answer, yes, we're planning to grow the same rate.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. We'd like to thank everyone. And I also would like to use this opportunity to, one more time, thank Ilya, who is with us on this call kind of the last time for all his contribution during the last 7 years to the company to helping us to come here, and helping a lot through our IPO process and almost the 2 years after this. So I just would like to pass to him for a couple of words. Thank you very much.
Ilya Cantor: Thank you very much, Ark. Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity to say a few parting words. It's been an interesting 7 years where I was fortunate to participate in EPAM's journey from what was then a small, but very focused engineering shop with just over 1,000 engineers to where we are today, a larger publicly traded, rapidly growing, but still very much focused provider of complex software engineering solution services, but to a much broader and diversified set of clients. I will certainly miss some of the intangibles that help make EPAM what it is, like the honesty of the Eastern European culture, the environment of accountability and a very strong competitive spirit that is very much alive in EPAM today. So while I'm sad to leave, I've happy to leave EPAM in the great shape that is today with solid leadership and a bright future. So thank you, all, for joining today, and we are happy with this quarter's performance and the outlook for the rest of the year.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Quarter 2 2013 EPAM Systems Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Anthony Conte, Vice President of Finance. Please proceed, sir.
Anthony Conte: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received the copy of the earnings release for the company's second quarter results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website at www.epam.com, together with our supplemental data sheet. The speakers we have on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Ilya Cantor, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Arkadiy Dobkin. Please go ahead, Arkadiy.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Anthony, and welcome, everyone. I'm happy to report that EPAM's second quarter performance was strong and at the top end of the guidance for the quarter. Revenue was $133.2 million, representing an increase of 28.3% year-over-year and 7.2% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin was 16.3% or 110 basis point sequential improvement and seasonal target range. Market demand for our services continues to be strong. We saw growth across all geographies and segments. Services and financial vertical were up 54% on continued strength in investment banking, mostly in Europe. IT and technology increased by 36% on positive momentum in several key accounts and continued demand for innovation and expertise in emerging technologies. We have seen important growth in our travel and consumer vertical, especially in North America. This was driven by both organic efforts and synergies related to the acquisition we made in 2012. This was our second fastest-growing vertical in North America with 52% growth. It also brought one of our new top 10 clients to the company. North America was up 35% year-over-year, benefiting from growth in U.S. IT and technology clients as well as from recent acquisition synergies. Europe continued to show strength with 33% growth. Much of this was coming from the financial services sector. CIS was down 1%, and this requires a short explanation. You might remember from our call at the same time last year that we had one operating recognition in the second quarter of 2012 related to the project in Ukraine sponsored by World Bank. Excluding this one-off nonrecurring revenue, CIS would have been 35% on a year-over-year basis. Today, CIS represents still 12% of total revenue. Our billable headcount increased by 15% to 8,900 engineers. While we have slightly increased utilization versus last quarter, we continue to carefully manage the large enough branch with now global delivery optimization to make sure they are fully capable to engage experienced and trusted professionals into new production activities. This also allows us to have enough time in specific situations to prepare our delivery personnel for new, sometimes challenging, opportunities require advanced technical skills and strong industry knowledge. In addition to closing one of the branches, we are working on improving our talent acquisition and talent management organizations across all locations, which is one of our corporate priorities. While mentioning [indiscernible], I would like to share that as we stated in our previous calls, we continue to focus on our client operations, sales and marketing capabilities. Here in Q2, we brought to the company new senior talent in that area, both in North America and Europe. We also just hired new global head of markets. And in addition to the inclusion of the proximity to a number of strategic clients, we expanded EPAM's presence in several new locations across North America and Western Europe. Finally, additional investments were addressed in our ultimate goal of continuously improving software engineering skills and developing other key emerging competencies using EPAM. During the second quarter, we have brought on board a new CEO [ph] to lead our investments in developing continuous specific engineering processes and, two, specialized application frameworks in a number of other software assets critical to differentiate ourselves from some solutions both in the value and in quality within our competitive market. Also, we deployed the EPAM [indiscernible] quality which makes our delivery environment even more sophisticated and agile, with faster deployment and real-time cloud was taken. Most importantly, it's given every one of our engineers the ability to understand how to work in cloud environment and translate this knowledge to the current and future client initiatives with ability to improve time-to-market cycles. We also brought strong, experienced leadership to our Big Data Competency Center while drafting several senior technologists to our U.S. company. We have deployed over 100 people and upgraded almost the entire internal system portfolio. This is also significant for our multimillion investments this year, including critical licenses and internal label. While we already have one of the best in the market internal applications and tools, which allow us to ensure control and reliability across all project life cycle stages, we are now focused on developing a highly social and collaborative environment, robust analytics and reporting and very efficient and tightly integrated into our system and scale custom relationship management optionality. Our recent acquisitions continue to perform in line with our expectations. Our Canadian business is strong with retail and telecom making significant progress. Our newly created digital strategy and experienced design solution process based on the Empathy Lab acquisition at the end of last year is successful by multiple measures. Major account acquisitions and demand from existing EPAM accounts are strong and creating new synergistic opportunities amongst our solution units. In most of these situations, the combination of local relationships and technical expertise, together with our group global delivery platform, is demonstrating an obvious win for us and for our clients. Our pipeline and visibility continue to be stable and predictable. These allow us to invest in the business, invest in bench strength and improve how we run our operations. We also continue to feel good about our leading position in complex software engineering services and solutions segment of the general IT services market, which contributes to our ability to continue growing above the industry average. I think it would be appropriate to mention at this point a couple of industry-specific conditions. First of all, in June, we were ranked #6 in the Forbes 2013 list of America's Fastest-Growing Tech Companies. This is prestigious for the company to achieve as we were ranked just behind some of the most well-known tech companies like LinkedIn, Facebook and Apple and a set of many other very well-recognized global technology brands. It's a tough list to get in. We're competing with other eligible [indiscernible] suppliers. So we were very proud of this recognition in general and also by the fact that we are one of the only 2 companies from IT services industry included in the Forbes Fast Tech 25. Second one, the results from the CT [ph] second quarter 2013 CIO survey were issued where 250 CIOs were questioned. These IT services were either gaining or losing share of the IT spend in dollars with the organization. In conclusion, we were -- EPAM and Cognizant were key the global share gainers. Likewise, this is a very respectable company to keep. It also reaffirms the fact that EPAM continues to gain market share on the strength of our differentiated service offering and expertise in emerging technology solutions. Now I will turn it over to Ilya, who will discuss financial performance in more details.
Ilya Cantor: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to spend a few minutes taking you through the details of the second quarter results, and then I will talk about our outlook for the third quarter of 2013 and our guidance for the year. As usual, the full details of our results can be found in our press release and the quarterly fact sheet located on the Investors section of our website. As detailed in our press release, our second quarter revenues grew 28.3% over last year to $133.2 million and 7.2% sequentially, at the top end of our guidance, while non-GAAP net income grew by 13.5% to $19.2 million compared to last year and 16.5% sequentially. Revenue in constant currency grew 28.6% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Non-GAAP earnings per share were also at the top end of our guidance with $0.40 per share for the quarter compared to $0.37 per share in the year ago quarter. Looking at revenue by service lines, Software Development continues to be by far the largest service offering, growing 30% year-over-year to $90.3 million and representing 68% of total revenue. Testing also grew 30% over last year and now represents almost 20% of revenue. Maintenance, Support and Infrastructure services together grew 18.8% to 10.6% of revenue. As we grow, we continue to diversify and broaden our customer base. While our top 20 accounts had solid growth in the quarter of 18.7%, the rest of the client base increased by 46% over last year. At the same time, we continue to strengthen our relationships with our top accounts. Barclay's, where we had a solid relationship over the years, remains our largest account and now represents 10% of revenue in the quarter. Our customer loyalty remained strong with 93.7% of revenues coming from customers who have been with us for at least 1 year and 78.3% of revenues coming from those who have been with us for 2 years. Excluding stock compensation and acquisition-related costs, SG&A was 19.3% of revenue as compared to 18.8% last year and 20.3% in the preceding quarter. The increase over last year is primarily due to the investments we continue to make in order to support the rapid growth and expansion of the business. Non-GAAP income from operations was $21.8 million for the second quarter, representing a 14.3% gain over the second quarter of the previous year. For the second quarter of 2013, non-GAAP operating margin was 16.3%, up 110 basis points from the preceding quarter but down from 18.4% a year ago due again to the investments needed to support our growth. As discussed before, our target non-GAAP operating margin range is 16% to 18% on a full year basis. Diluted share count for the quarter has increased by 1.6 million shares to 48 million from the same quarter last year mainly due to equity grants to employees and acquisition considerations. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $107.5 million in cash. Cash provided by operating activities during the quarter was $8 million. Unbilled revenue was $57.7 million at June 30 compared to $33.4 million at December 31, which follows the normal seasonal pattern. In July, we subsequently billed $26 million of the $57.7 million unbilled. Net cash of $7.5 million was used in investing activities during the quarter, down $5.2 million from the second quarter of 2012 primarily as a result of a Thoughtcorp acquisition. Net cash provided by financing activities was $4.6 million, primarily due to the funds received in connection with employee stock option exercises. Accounts receivable were $82.8 million at the end of Q2, up 5% from year end, and we finished the quarter with a DSO of 59 days. IT professional headcount increased 15% over last year to support 28.3% revenue growth. Our ability to leverage headcount to drive revenue growth is primarily due to 2 things: one, a favorable pricing environment; and two, as Ark mentioned, slightly improved utilization. We ended the quarter with 8,900 engineers. Our effective tax rate was below guidance by about 100 basis points, up 19% compared to 16.2% in the prior year quarter. The increase over last year was due to the impact of acquisitions made in 2012 in North America. Turning to our guidance for Q3 and the balance of the year. We are seeing a healthy demand in our environment from existing accounts, and we see solid business development activity in pipeline. Therefore, we continue to feel confident in the outlook we have provided to you last quarter. As such, for the full year, we are reiterating our prior guidance of revenue growth of 23% to 25% year-over-year. On a full year basis, we continue to expect non-GAAP net income growth to be in the range of 12% to 15% with a tax rate of approximately 20%. For the third quarter of 2013, we expect revenues between $135 million and $137 million, representing growth of 23% to 25% over the third quarter of 2012. The non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.41 to $0.42 based on a weighted average of 48.7 million diluted shares and a 20% tax rate. All guidance excludes any nonoperating currency gains and losses. With that, I would like to turn the call back to the operator to open it up for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Moshe Katri of Cowen.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Ilya and Arkadiy, can you talk a bit about your pipeline, especially a look at your visibility for the next 6 to 12 months. Maybe in the context -- in this context, you can talk about new client wins for the quarter, the number of new client wins, which verticals and then which regions.
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think our visibility very similar to what we saw in the past. So we usually can project for the next 12 months around 80% of our revenue. So it's very similar right now for the next quarter. Again, we -- we're talking about like we provided guidance already. So this was a number. It was the number. So during the last quarter, we probably brought around 12, 15 new clients, some of them potentially big, some of them more kind of on discretionary side. We don't exactly how it would be developed yet, but it's -- again, it's very, very usual. I don't think we see any differences as we were like communicating in the previous calls in comparison with the previous periods. In regards to locations or geographies, it's also distributed pretty normally for us, basically proportionally to our main focus verticals. I would say that we have also interesting opportunities still with clients which we working -- opportunities which we're working together with our recently acquired companies. Not necessary for existing clients but exactly on the synergies between what these companies were doing before and what we're doing together right now.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Right. Just 2 small ones here. Just to supplement the spreadsheet that you have on your website, I didn't see the numbers for top 1 client for the quarter. There -- you have top 5 and top 10. And then maybe kind of talk a bit about the FX losses that you had during the quarter.
Ilya Cantor: Our top one client is now Barclays, and it has been Barclays. They've just reached 10%. And what's the second part of your question, Moshe?
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: FX losses for the quarter?
Ilya Cantor: FX losses. We had some sort of regular translation remeasurement losses that we included in the P&L of about, I want to say, $160,000. The actual economic currency losses that impact margins were actually around $200,000 or $300,000 because we remain relatively naturally hedged. As far as impact on the top line year-over-year, FX impact was a negative $850,000 or so. Sequential was about negative $900,000 or so.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich of UBS.
Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Can you make some more detailed comments on the pricing and wage rate environment, please?
Ilya Cantor: So on the pricing, as we mentioned in the script, we see a relatively favorable pricing environment. And this is consistent with the last 2 or 3 years. We are able to leverage the skill set that we provide our clients and the sophistication of our solutions to warrant relatively good price increases. So that remains strong. As far as the wage inflation, the year is not yet done. We have typically one promotion cycle, one defined promotion cycle at the beginning of the year and one smaller cycle, midyear. Those are in line with our expectations so far. But again, the year is not over yet.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citibank.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Good quarter. I guess my first question is with regards to sales productivity. Could you comment on how that initiative is progressing?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So by sales productivity, you mean what exactly?
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So you have traditionally, obviously, grown the most through word of mouth and so on. But more recently, you have both hired and 2 acquisitions got a larger sales force. How is the integration of that sales force progressing? How are you -- are you -- are they able to bring larger contracts to you? How you're managing that? If you could comment on it.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, we increased sales capacity, and we mentioned during today -- talk already that we invested in this area. So at the same time, on the big picture, the proportion of contribution of new deal, probably very, very similar to what we said in the past. In absolute numbers, it's clearly growing approximately 30% in comparison. So -- and it require new number of people. So I mentioned also that the sales force which we inherited through some acquisitions is actually working pretty productively. In some cases, it's a very solution-oriented sales force, which is opening for us doors for new big accounts and we are leveraging our global delivery capability to expand there. It's not necessarily related to bringing like very large deals right away. On another side, we have examples like this. We mentioned that -- already that we have one of the accounts which we started 12 months ago come in to be one of the top 10 accounts this year. So I think it's improving, and it's improving with our expectations. But there is not yet any dramatical changes, and we're not expecting such.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. No, that's useful. Just to clarify, are these salespeople generally quota-carrying salespeople? And if they are, how are they doing versus that quota?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, this is like there is a number of people who have quarterly targets. And on average, they're doing well. So I don't know on what level of details you'd like us to comment right now, so -- but...
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Sure. I mean...
Ilya Cantor: Ashwin, Ashwin, this is Ilya.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes.
Ilya Cantor: I mean, so far, as you've seen, our year has stacked up pretty much in line, slightly above our expectations and what we guided to at the beginning of the year. So the targets are likewise relative to that cadence. There has been some good wins to where some things are a little bit higher than others, and it all kind of averages out to be relatively similar to how we perform against our guidance.
Arkadiy Dobkin: You -- Ashwin, you can see this through some kind of indirect numbers when the proportion of the top 5 and 10 clients is decreasing, which means that we're bringing more revenue on the bottom line, which is potentially growing. But as we always say, again we have a big number of accounts in $5 million range, which is still growing. So it's very difficult to kind of draw the line what's coming from -- what contributed significantly from new accounts or existing accounts right now. And to be actually focusing on growing existing accounts very, very seriously as well.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Right, okay. My last question really is with regards to M&A. You've made those -- these 2 acquisitions, Thoughtcorp, Empathy. Both seem to be going well. You do have a very strong balance sheet here and cash generation. Any thoughts on M&A pipeline either from a strategic perspective or from just from an opportunistic perspective?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So we're clearly looking at this from strategic perspective, but we are not declining when opportunistically something that's interesting come in. That's all I could say. And there -- we are always open for new opportunities there, and we're constantly working on this. But that's a -- I don't think we can comment anything more than that right now.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon of Needham.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Ark and Ilya, I wanted to get a sense from you if you could give us some color on the penetration level within your, say, top 20, top 30 clients. Where are you in terms of their budget? I'm trying to get a handle on how much you can grow with these clients. And then also, if you could just talk generically about your win rate versus your competition in the market and how that's been trending in the last, say, 6 to 12 months.
Arkadiy Dobkin: So the first question, as I mentioned, we do have the potential with our top 20 or even probably 40 clients. So usually, our portion of the budget there are relatively small in comparison to some big players which we compete in. Like if you think about financial services, large players have $100 million, $150 million budgets with some of the largest world banks where we have right now, like, in tens of millions. So -- and this would be true practically for all our -- not all but majority of our top 20 clients. So it's a big potential there. So and the second question was?
Ilya Cantor: Win rate.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Well, on your win rates, how that's been trending.
Arkadiy Dobkin: You ask how we compare versus our competitors. Here, I have difficulties to comment because I don't know exactly statistics, how it's working for competitors.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Well, let me ask you this. Have you seen a change in the competitive landscape at all in terms of who you're baking off against when you're in the market for these deals?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay, that's easier to answer. I think it's very consistent for us for the last couple of years depending on specific vertical and geography. We've seen different type of competitors, but it's very consistent for -- again for the last couple of years.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Just one more follow-up. I wanted to get a sense from you if the regulatory side of health care and financial services is an opportunity. Many of your peers have been talking about that as a key growth driver for the next, say, 12 to 18 months. Are you investing in those areas? Should we count on that as being also a growth engine for you?
Arkadiy Dobkin: We're looking at this, and we're doing some specific efforts to benefit from this. But how it would work, we will see like in next few years because this is also a very competitive area where a lot of people are focusing on. So we, including ourself in it, too. So like, for example, we're bidding right now for one of the largest deals probably in financial services, but it's a very big competition there and many hundreds of million dollars. So what happened with this, who knows?
Operator: The next question comes on the line of David Grossman of Stifel.
David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I wonder if we could just go back to some of the investments that you're making in the business. And obviously, this has been a fairly big investment year for you. Do you think that we're at some steady state equilibrium, if you will, in terms of spending levels as a percentage of revenue? Or do you think, just based on where we are here midyear, that the growth, even relative to the strong growth of the business, that those investments may need to increase over the next 12 to 18 months?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I don't think we're looking at this as a percentage of the revenue. So we're more looking at this as what actually should be done to make sure that we can grow in the future. So -- and it's a little bit like try and see, and that's what -- probably will be continuous for us. I don't think we would be looking from just percentage basis investment type.
David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So I guess with that said, Ark, do you -- are there any areas -- if we kind of look at the portfolio of investments we've made over the course of the year, where do you feel you've made the most progress? And where are areas, I guess, that you feel you need to step it up even more?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So like investment, for example, in sales organization and marketing or internal sales to assets, so we're doing investment during the last periods and we're doing this right now, some of them starting to bring some returns, some we still need to see. So I cannot like really predict what would be happening exactly during the next 12 months. We're analyzing different areas and changing kind of direction a little bit or keeping it. So very difficult, very difficult to speculate on this topic.
David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And just looking at the maintenance business. As always, your maintenance kind of stream as a percentage of your overall mix has been different than the competition. I think obviously, your model is a little bit different. Are you thinking any differently about the maintenance business and how big you want that to be as a percentage of the mix? Are you pretty comfortable with kind of where it is and how it's trending relative to the growth of the overall business?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think, David, there is like also -- just from understanding of my Internet and support in changing environment, when there is like very difficult questions how cloud, for example, or any new technology trends actually changes the landscape. And what we're seeing with our clients, which is, we do believe, more kind of technology driven, that maintenance and support type of service is changing as well. It's not like regular legacy maintenance and support, it's a maintenance and support of very kind of live systems where deployments could be happening like in daily times or even more often for online marketing or e-commerce systems. And in this case, it's in reality, maintenance and support means something very different from what traditionally were considered. And it's very difficult to separate as well because it's practically nonstop life cycle of development and support of the systems. So we're looking at this differently, and it's even statistically very difficult to separate what's the development of new features and new releases. Again if you're talking about the systems like online booking for travel industry, for example, or it's a traditional maintenance and support. From this point of view, yes, it's a small percentage, but it's mostly probably related to more traditional part. And for this new type of systems, it's very difficult to separate. So it's a little bit a gray area.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Alexander Vengranovich of OTKRITIE Capital.
Alexander Vengranovich - OTKRITIE Securities Ltd., Research Division: I want to come back actually to the split of your revenues by vertical. So I see that the banking and financial services vertical is continuing to grow faster than the others. So I'm just wondering whether this trend that's driven by the market is more the client-specific issue for you, so you see more demand from your specific client. And what are actually the drivers of faster growth for financial services industry? And do you continue probably, and do you expect to increase the share of that vertical in your revenue mix?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think you can look at this a little bit differently because if you look at most of our competitors, financial services would be a very big proportion of their business, sometimes 40%, 50% or even 60%, 70%. And this is a very big number of companies in our competitive landscape. EPAM, based on the history and how it was developed, we started, as we mentioned many times, from strictly software engineering for technology companies. So we're kind of catching up in this area and growing this proportionally to the size of the total market because clearly, financial services still is the #1 champion in global services. So that's why it's growing faster. We become bigger in financial services, recognizing their need for more technology-driven lenders. And we're getting our share. So that's probably the reason why it's growing faster than anything else. And I think we still have some room to grow there.
Alexander Vengranovich - OTKRITIE Securities Ltd., Research Division: Yes, okay. And with regards to your revenues, so are you growing more of, let's say, the existing clients or you're adding more of the new accounts to financial services industry?
Arkadiy Dobkin: We have already good growth in several existing large clients, but we added a number of very interesting new clients to the list as well.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of John Stirtchen [ph] of JPMorgan.
Unknown Analyst: I had 2 questions. Firstly, just on the sales force. I think you mentioned you hired a new head of marketing during the quarter and also put some new salespeople into various places in Europe and North America. Could you just give us a little background on the kind of people you're recruiting for this -- for these kind of roles? Firstly, are they coming from competitors or are you hiring people with specific vertical expertise? That's going to be the first part of that. Second question I had, more for Ilya, was just on the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP net income this quarter. It was one of the biggest divergences in the past several quarters primarily driven by quite a large stock-based compensation line. Is there any reason it was big this quarter? And is there any guidance you can give on how that might trend for those who often look at the GAAP measure more than the non-GAAP measure?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So the first -- on the first question, it's an easy answer. So it's both. We're hiring people with very strong industry expertise who have experience to manage a very large account and grow very large accounts and work -- have experience in the industry like 5, 10 years. On another side, we bring in some people who have specific expert knowledge in our focused areas. So it's really both.
Ilya Cantor: And on your question about the difference of GAAP and non-GAAP and divergence, there was, in particular, a onetime charge in the stock comp line related to an acceleration of a restricted stock award that we gave as part of the -- one of the 2 acquisitions we made last year. We basically parted ways with one of the senior managers who got the stock award, and, by GAAP, we had to accelerate. And that was about $900,000 worth. In other words, our stock comp would then benefit from not having that piece amortized over the next 2 years. As you probably know, looking at reconciliations, other areas of difference between GAAP and non-GAAP net income is purchase accounting, foreign exchange and other onetime gains or losses. But that was the biggest thing contributing to the uptick in stock-based compensation.
Alexander Vengranovich - OTKRITIE Securities Ltd., Research Division: If I could ask one follow-up question on -- now the acquisitions have been with the company for at least a small amount of time, is there anything you can say about how -- well, your confidence that you can maintain a culture that's made the company successful so far while adding on more onshore acquisitions, which obviously come with a different culture and heritage?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, that's an interesting question. It's clearly a challenge for anybody. At the same time, we have a history of kind of doing pretty well there because if you look at the history of our acquisitions, most of the people which came to us have been with the company for a very long time and becoming part of our management team. So when -- the last 2 acquisitions, you're also correct, were a little bit different. It was mostly done with staff in North America. And from another point of view, I think it creates really good opportunities for the employees of these companies to work in global, big companies and kind of integrate and start to work with global delivery. I think it's a mature way to give people much bigger opportunities. So far, we didn't see any real problems in this area.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri of Cowen.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Just I have a follow-up on the 2 acquisitions that you've done last year, Empathy Lab, Thoughtcorp. Maybe you can give us an update on maybe the integration. Maybe you can give us an update on some of the benefits that you've been able to get through your pipeline from those acquisitions. Obviously, Empathy focuses more on digital media and entertainment. Have you seen anything -- obviously, this is kind of the hot area right now in terms of demand. Maybe you can talk about that. And Thoughtcorp is based out of Canada. Maybe you can talk about that, too, in terms of your ability to kind of penetrate that market.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, we mentioned some stuff in our first talk today. And in regards to Canada, we talked about it several times. I think we see confirmation of our regional kind of expectations about synergies between strong on-site presence in the market and our global delivery capabilities. And what's happening exactly confirming all those expectations. We have pretty visible growth in Canadian market today. We have a couple of clients, which one of them already top 10. And we're hoping that during the next 12 months, maybe another one will become pretty large as well. So it's, again, developing based on our expectation pretty much. Also on Empathy Lab's side, we've done this specifically to improve our capabilities in media entertainment and retail space, where you have seen that our technical skills and our ability to deliver complex applications like in some solution expertise and solution leadership to kind of get engaged in big deals from the very beginning. What we've seen after practically only 6 months of working together is that it's not only allows to open new doors and offer much broader total solution to the clients, it's also bringing a lot of benefits to the existing clients where we come in and offer services which they didn't expect it from us before, where we're starting to pull some competitors in the areas which they didn't expect us to play. And it's also this type of expertise which we bring and actually generating additional revenue around it for us. So if -- we're already seeing this confirmation. So we hope like in another 6 to 12 months it would become much, much more visible.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich of UBS.
Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I just wondered, I think you were talking about hiring a marketing executive and trying to enhance your branding over time. Can you give us any thoughts there?
Arkadiy Dobkin: We've just hired a person, so let's talk about it next quarter.
Operator: And I'd like to turn the call back over to Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President, for closing remarks.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, so thank you, everyone, again for joining. We're happy with the quarter results, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Probably we'll be able to address your questions better and in more details likely. So some of them which we're trying to defer to the next periods. Thank you again very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today. You may now disconnect. Thank you for joining. Have a very good day.

===== 2013 Q1  (2013-05-09 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Anthony Conte Arkadiy Dobkin - Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Ilya Cantor - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Senior Vice President and Treasurer
Analysts: Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Anastasia Obukhova - VTB Capital, Research Division Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division Elizabeth Colley - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the EPAM Systems First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Anthony Conte, VP of Finance. Thank you, Mr. Conte, you may begin.
Anthony Conte: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received the copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website at www.epam.com, together with our supplemental data sheet. The speakers we have on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Ilya Cantor, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties, as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Arkadiy Dobkin. Please go ahead, Arkadiy.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Anthony. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter 2013 earnings call. This morning, we are pleased to report another strong quarter of industry-leading performance. Total revenue grew 31.6% to $124.2 million year-over-year, and 32.7% on constant currency basis. That's the high end of our guidance. Adjusted income from operations increased 16.8% to $18.8 million year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.35, ahead of expectations. Performance was strong across all geographies. North America, our largest market, grew 38%. Europe was up 24%, and the CIS region increased 31%. With North America, IT technology is a major growth driver in Q1. The flexibility and agility become the keywords for customers today, are increasingly seeking different and better ways to tap into new opportunities to grow business for their clients and for themselves. The maturing FAST Cloud Forum, emerging cloud models, Big Data and Analytics and Enterprise Mobility are defining the way how IT is design there today. Products and Solutions segment. All that puts very different demands on the skill set and experience for their development partners. EPAM has been historically focused on IT Technology segment, and while this focus we had built very strong expertise in most of these important emergent and adjacent technologies. As such, we are well-positioned to benefit further from this very fast growing segment within the broader global delivery market. Also during this quarter, EPAM significant progress with a number of big accounts in traveling consumer and business information and media verticals. In addition, we started to gain real traction and realize synergies from our acquisitions of Thoughtcorp in Canada and Empathy Lab in Europe. In Europe, we also have strong forward momentum. With continued economical volatility, companies in Europe are just facing the requirements, and EPAM was ideally suited in Europe already, and we would have proven value and depth of service [indiscernible]. In particular, banking and finance customers continue to grow and expand with us. Another important growth area in Europe revolves around eCommerce. While selling through a multiple is nothing new, the growing complexity and constantly changing needs of front-end, back-end systems, the cost of integration efforts and disconnected business processes in place at many companies have made it economically prohibitive to deliver a truly optimized omni-channel experience. So you see today opportunities not only from new e-commerce implementations, but also from the platform and customization and integration initiatives around enterprise corners. On a related note, we have recently been granted Oracle Top Business Impact Partner, EMEA 2012 award during the 5th Annual Oracle Commerce Conference in Lisbon. This is a big deal for us. Our success as a leading partner in Europe Oracle Enterprise Commerce platform is supported by a long history of providing product development and R&D services for several related Oracle product lines. So that is a clear confirmation of our message of leveraging our IT Technology Services expertise further, now focused industry markets and the plan to capitalize on such leverage more in the future. Also on the topic of industry recognition in Europe, the work we did with Wolters Kluwer in the semantics search area has recently been awarded the 2013 European Outsourcing Association Award in category IT Outsourcing Project of the Year. In CIS region. We increased 31% year-over-year on steady growth in virtually every sector. In Russia, we see similar trends related eCommerce that we talked about it in the European market. Our business in traveling consumer vertical in Russia is growing. This was primarily due to the success of large web commerce initiatives, with such major retailers in the region as M.Video, a leading Russian consumer electronics chain; L'Etoile, which is Russia's largest cosmetic and perfumery network; and Sportmaster, the leading sports retailer in CIS. We believe that this vertical is going to continue to expand rapidly and will be an interesting opportunity for us. We are focusing our efforts on developing this further by bringing into the local markets our substantial expertise in eCommerce, which we accumulated globally today. With our recognized success as the top-tier Oracle partner, as well as expertise with other eCommerce solutions, we are very well-positioned to capture opportunities in Russia's bigger markets. Now I would like to spend a couple of moments talking about our most recent acquisition of Empathy Lab, and restate the distinct value proposition, especially in regards to the opportunities I mentioned before. This is a US-based digital strategy and execution firm, which specializes in consulting, digital strategies, user experience and design and digital product development. There are several key areas where Empathy is very complementing to our services. We know, based on experience, as majority of our clients in travel and consumer, business information and media and many clients within financial services vertical that user experience is becoming paramount to the success -- to the solutions we deliver. Traditional companies in those verticals converted themselves in software-driven enterprises. So EPAM Empathy Lab demonstrated, in their part, their ability to help clients in the new reality to define and understand business challenges and outcomes that can be achieved using modern digital strategies and user experience design, which become pervasive and persistent part across all spectrums of software solutions. Second, Empathy is a well-respected Oracle eCommerce partner. They helped improve EPAM solutions capability broadly in e-Commerce area. Working with such well-known brands such as Avon, DIRECTV and Liberty Global. Empathy Lab, also acts as the strategic advisor, program monitor and digital agency for the Red Cross. As a result of this partnership, the new redcross.org built on Oracle ATG Web Commerce, set a new record, handling peak volumes of donations for victims of Hurricane Sandy, while maintaining 100% uptime. Another major client, Liberty Global, awarded Empathy Lab for its contribution to Horizon TV Online, with 2012 Global Vendor Award for Innovation and Breakthrough at their annual technology summit in Amsterdam. The award recognized Empathy Lab as the leading partner and won over 1,000 vendors who support Liberty Global in this strategic and operational initiatives. We can continue this topic, but let me simply conclude that Empathy should help us to forge a more direct path to accessing chief marketing officer budgets, which, according to analysts' prediction during the next several years, will spend significantly more than CIOs do today, mostly driven by e-Commerce, social and mobile and marketing initiatives. We believe this to be true. Combining that with EPAM traditional strong focus on advanced technologies and [indiscernible] should allow us to continue growing at above-market rates. Turning to new business. New business acquisition was healthy during Q1, both organically and through relationship that existed at Thoughtcorp and Empathy Lab. This month is 1 year anniversary of the Thoughtcorp acquisition, and I'm pleased to report that our expectations made on synergies held very true so far. For example, we have acquired, less than 9 months ago, a major client, who will be among top 10 EPAM clients this year. During this quarter, the head of the Canadian mobile device manufacture, discussed a potential to become a major client in 2014. We also have several very key opportunities now to convert several large local customers in Canada to our global delivery client base. It's very different level of potential. Very similar trend we see right now with Empathy client, and during Q1, we already proved that there is multiple instances. Overall, we added new clients in each industry vertical and some of them show strong promise to ramp rapidly during 2013. With that, I will turn the call over to Ilya for the financial review.
Ilya Cantor: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. As detailed in our press release, our first quarter revenue grew 31.6% over last year to $124.2 million, or 32.7% on a constant currency basis, while adjusted net income grew by 14.7% to $16.5 million, and earnings per share were $0.35. All of our verticals performed well. IT and Technology was up 37.5% year-over-year, and 5.1% sequentially, accounting for 26% of revenue. This growth was driven by several of our top accounts in those verticals, as well as continued broad-based demand for complex software development and solutions for many of our existing, as well as several new clients. Banking & Financial Services continue to be a fast-growing vertical for us, increasing 45.9% year-over-year to 26.2% of revenues. Travel & Consumer increased 14.5% to 22% of total. Business Information & Media grew 8.8% to 14.2% of revenue. However, excluding the impact of Thomson Reuters, this vertical would be up 54.1% year-over-year, but then you also have to adjust for the impact of Empathy Lab, so adjusting for both Thomson Reuters and Empathy Lab's organic growth in this segment is 15% year-over-year. In our other vertical, this is up 74.1% year-over-year to 10.4% of revenues. We were benefited, primarily, from growth in the single particular large oil and gas client, as well as good performance in several of our telco accounts. Turning now to our performance by service line. Software development services revenue, which includes product development and application software development increased 33% to $84 million or 67.5% total. Testing increased 28% to $24 million or 19.4% of revenue. Maintenance and support revenues increased 31.5% to $11 million or 8.7% of total, compared to 8.2% of total in Q4. And Infrastructure Services increased 31% to 2.10% of revenue. On performance by geography, North America increased 37.7% to 51.9% of total. Again, here, we also had the benefit of Empathy Lab's, as well as the Thoughtcorp acquisition, neither of which were reported in the first quarter of 2012. Europe has grown 23.5%, almost entirely organically, and CIS increased 31.4%. However, I should note that CIS was down $9.5 million, sequentially, because of a really tough comparison to the December quarter of last year, which had a ramp-up in service delivery and related revenue recognition at 3 or 4 projects we did for several banks in the region, as well as backloaded delivery acceptance with a large government project in the region. This pattern, however, is relatively normal for the December quarter, when acceptance of the deliverables tends to be pushed towards the end of the year. Also contributing to the tough comparison is that we had some budget flush in CIS in the fourth quarter, which we spoke about during the last call. Our customers continue to be very loyal. 90% and 77% of our revenues in the first quarter of 2013 came from clients who had used our services for at least 1 and 2 years, respectively. This is excluding the impact of 2 acquisitions made in 2012. Revenues from our top 10 accounts increased 14.7% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of Thomson Reuters, our top 10 would have grown 26%. Turning to costs. Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was $77.9 million in the first quarter of 2013, which is an increase of 29.5% over $60.2 million reported in the last year period. Cost of revenue, excluding stock compensation, was $77.2 million in the first quarter or 62.1% revenue, compared to 63.2% of revenues in the same quarter last year. IT professional headcount increased 19%, while revenue increased 32%, as we have increased utilization slightly in the quarter. First quarter SG&A expenses were $27.1 million as reported. Excluding stock comp and acquisition-related costs, SG&A was $25.2 million or 20.3% of revenue, as compared to $16.6 million or 17.5% of revenue in Q1 of 2012. This difference is primarily due to increased cost of being a public company, as well as investments we discussed last quarter that we're making to support rapid growth and expansion of our business, including the development of account management and other onsite roles, as well as additional personnel and infrastructure build-out, necessary to keep up with the rapid growth of our business. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter was $3.6 million or $1.4 million, or 63.6% increase over Q1 of 2012. The increased depreciation is due to additional CapEx for equipment to support the growth in headcount, as well as $0.6 million from amortization of intangibles from the Thoughtcorp and Empathy Lab acquisitions. Non-GAAP income from operations was $18.8 million for the first quarter, representing a 16.8% gain over the first quarter of the previous year. For the first quarter of 2013, non-GAAP operating margin was 15.2%, down from 17.1% a year ago, primarily due to the several factors that I just described. As there were several nonrecurring actors impacting margins this quarter, we anticipate that our margins will improve moderately from here during the rest of the year, and remain within our target range of 16% to 18%, although there can be variations during the periods as we continue to invest to support our growth. Net interest income was $0.6 million for the quarter. GAAP foreign exchange loss was about $500,000 for the quarter. Non-GAAP net income or net income, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisition costs, amortization of acquisition and intangibles and stock-based compensation, was $16.5 million for the quarter or $0.35 per diluted share, up 12.9% from $0.31 reported in Q1 of 2012. Now let's look at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $103 million in cash. Cash used in operating activities was $11.7 million. This was due to typical seasonal factors, such as year-end bonuses, tax payments and growth in unbilled revenue. Unbilled billed revenue was $53.6 million at March 31, compared to $35.7 million in December 31. However, we have subsequently billed $17 million of $53.6 million in April. So this is a typical seasonal pattern. Net cash of $6.5 million was used in investing activities during 2013, up $2.8 million, primarily the result of employee loans issued in the first quarter of 2013. Net cash provided by financing activities was $4 million, primarily due to funds received in connection with employee stock option exercises. Accounts receivable were $75.7 million at the end of Q1, down 4% from year-end. We finished the quarter with a DSO or days sales outstanding of 56 days, same as last quarter. On a final note, there's a lot of discussion and uncertainty about the Senate immigration reform bill and a provision to that bill, related to H-1B and L-1 visas. We get many of our people that are in the U.S. today from our offshore locations on L-1 visas, which are not the focal point of the bill. Only 16% of our U.S staff are H-1Bs, which is relatively close to the 15% limit that is in the current draft. So even if it's assuming the current draft survived substantially in its present form, which we believe is highly unlikely, we don't believe this issue will have a meaningful impact on EPAM given that approximately 90%, 95% of our services are delivered offshore. And potentially, this could also be an opportunity for us, if there is significant disruption to others caused by the final version of this bill. Turning to our guidance for Q2 and the balance of the year. On the outlook for the year, we're seeing a healthy demand environment from our existing accounts, and we also see solid business development activity in the pipeline. Therefore, we continue to feel confident in the outlook we've provided to you last quarter. And as such, for the full year, we are reiterating our prior guidance of revenue growth of 23% to 25% over 2012 results. On a full year basis, we continue to expect non-GAAP earnings growth to be in the range of 12% to 15%, with the tax rate of approximately 20%. For the second quarter of 2013, we expect revenue between $131 million and $133 million, representing growth rate of 26% to 28% over the second quarter of 2012. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share expected to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.40, based on weighted average of 48 million diluted shares and a 20% tax rate. I should note all guidance excludes any assumption for nonoperating currency gains or losses. With that, I would like to turn the call back to the operator to open it up for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: My first question is for -- just looking beyond Q2 for the rest of this year, should we expect a similar pattern of sequential revenue growth that we did to last year?
Ilya Cantor: I think the short answer is approximately yes. And we don't guide quarter-to-quarter, we're still confident in the full year guidance that we did provide.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Just to add, it's Arkadiy. So it's very difficult to predict the jump, which we had in Q4 last year. So we're not counting on this type of event, so just to make sure we are on the same page.
Anastasia Obukhova - VTB Capital, Research Division: Right. Actually, the right thing to do is to not have, at this stage, any assumptions around fourth quarter budget flush. So the second question, I guess, is, if I could just drill down on the DSOs and the unbilled DSOs in particular. And I know, Ilya, that you said that $17 million of the $53 million was billed in April. But in general, as your projects get a little bit more complex, I guess, to Ark's point, the key made in his remarks, should we expect the DSOs and unbilled DSOs to go up modestly from here, just from a cash flow modeling perspective?
Ilya Cantor: I think it's probably -- we're not going to depart materially from today's DSO levels, and we're working diligently and continuously on making sure that we have favorable payment terms negotiated upfront in our contracts, and also that we follow-up diligently on collecting receivables. However, particularly as there is some fluctuations, in particular, where you saw in CIS region in Q4 in quarter 1, you can expect some volatility, in particular, from that region. But I wouldn't say that we're going to be materially different from today's level.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Got it. The last question, just a clarification. The 16% number that you gave, with regards to the, I guess, the Senate Bill, was that just for H-1s or H-1/L-1 combined? And if it was just for H-1, what is the L-1 percentage? Because there are elements in the bill that apply to L-1, as well as I think.
Ilya Cantor: Sure. The 16% applies only to H-1Vs, and the difference being 15% and 16% for us is literally 5 people. So that's very small, if some or all go on green cards, which is the typical path, and we don't have an issue. L-1s are 27% of our US-based staffing. So together, it's about 43% on total on temporary visas.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen and company.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Ilya and Arkadiy, can you talk a bit about some of the investments that you are going through, making actually, this year? Where are we in that phase, and maybe talk a bit about what you're doing on the sell-side of the business as well?
Arkadiy Dobkin: Moshe, so our investments, there is nothing drastically new in line of investments we do. So we were talking about increasing number of on-site people to make sure that our connection with clients are better, and we better prepare it to manage more complex projects as we're getting involved all the time, more and more. So this is one area of investment. We're investing in building competency centers, so this requires some level of dedication and non-billable people to be able to summarize the knowledge and actually distribute and provide guidance and very specific presale support. So it's clearly another area and require very qualified personnel to perform. And thanks for reminding us about our sales aspirations. So that's clearly one more investment focus for us, and we're hiring people in this segment as well. And as you all know, it all was kind of under-invested area at EPAM, where we were getting business a lot through referrals and existing relationships. So I would say that it's in focus today also. General stuff, each company like -- because we're growing in infrastructure and all that, but I would focus more on the kind of client base and capabilities and competency capabilities, which is very, very important for us.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then can we talk a bit about Thomson Reuters? And it's still about 4% of revenues and I'm assuming, was it down or flat sequentially for the quarter?
Arkadiy Dobkin: It's still going down quarter-by-quarter, okay. But at this point...
Ilya Cantor: I'm sorry, it's about 3.6%. I think it's stabilized, but we don't clearly...
Arkadiy Dobkin: So there is no -- like we -- again, we know what was scheduled for ramp-down from the past, and 3 in projects in exactly on this ramp-down. So I'll really mention right now, it's 3.6% of our revenue. And I don't think we can add anything else. So it's basically client-dependent. There are some new work coming. We're just quoting to get relatively sizeable, completely new deal inside of Thomson Reuters, but it's in our capabilities. But it's probably all I can share right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel.
David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I'm wondering if we could go to the gross margin. After a couple of periods of decline, it increased in the December quarter and then increased again in the March quarter. And I'm just wondering, is that from the core business? Is it acquisition-related? Or is there something else fundamentally going on in the gross margin line?
Ilya Cantor: As far as the gross margin is concerned, we did improve our utilization a bit in this quarter, and we're continuing to work on improving it moderately during the rest of the year. If you notice, we've added, in the quarter, only 19% headcount year-over-year, compared to 32% revenue growth. While this gap is not expected to continue in its dimension, we do sort of expect a nonlinear pattern to headcount additions versus revenue growth.
David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, as I think about that and the relationship between -- I know you talked about the investments just a minute ago that you're making in the business that's impacting operating expenses, at what point do those cross, where you get more stability in the operating margin? Or do you just think you're going to be bouncing around in this bandwidth of the 16% to 18%, just depending on the quarter and the year?
Ilya Cantor: I mean, we're in rapid growth mode. And again, we continue to invest in the business. I think if we decide to stop investing, that's going to impact future revenue growth. And in our stage of development, this is -- our priority is to continue to grow. And so we will continue to live within our stated margin range. You might not see it sort of exactly linear quarter-to-quarter, but for the full year, we expect to be in the 16% to 18% range. And we feel pretty confident about that.
David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just going back to the new customer activity, can you give us a sense of just how much, I guess, I don't know if I could call it pipeline or new business signed in the last 6 months, but some metric that will give us a sense of what the new customer acquisition activity has been over the last 2 quarters?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I would give you more like, what revenue we have today, which we closed during the last 12 months. And in Q1, it's approximately $12 million, $13 million for business, which was acquired during the previous 12 months. So this is not counting clients, which we got from Thoughtcorp or Empathy Lab. This is kind of new, new clients. But in our situation, when we're talking about sales and new business and investments, you also need to realize that we have very good client base, which is, from this point of view, should be considered as a pretty significant source of growth for us, in addition to new, new clients. And when we're talking, again, about sales and account management, it's not just about new, new business, it's about how we can bring more value to existing clients, and how we can convert this $1 million or $5 million accounts to, respectively, $5 million, $10 million and $15 million, $20 million accounts. And we have a number of very big opportunities with this and this is required investment from us for the right people who would be able to help in this setting, just to make sure it's very clear.
David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: In that context, did you say that the top 10 grew 15%. Is that what we said in the quarter?
Ilya Cantor: Yes, that's correct. But if you exclude the impact of Thomson Reuters, then sort of the top 9 has grown 26%.
Arkadiy Dobkin: We still kind of floors in average growth of the company, which means that the next number of clients growing faster, and they actually create even more opportunities for us to grow.
David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, got it. And then, just one last thing, I'm wondering, Ilya, can you just remind us what your expectations are for the non-GAAP adjustments for the year in terms of stock comps and amortization?
Ilya Cantor: Sure. Stock comp, approximately $12 million or $13 million for the year. And amortization, just one second, it's about $2.4 million on amortization.
David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: $2.6 million, I'm sorry?
Ilya Cantor: $2.4 million.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Colley with Needham & Company.
Elizabeth Colley - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: This is Elizabeth for Mayank Tandon. Can you give us any color on M&A plans and what sort of areas you might be targeting, as far as geographies, verticals, services?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think we can only restate what we were sharing before. Our M&A is focused in a couple of areas, mostly in competencies, to grow our technologies and some industry spectrum and potentially, capacity in additional geographies. And that's what we're looking for and that's what we're evaluating. But I don't think we can share a very specific plans at this point. Most likely, you will find out about it only from future press releases.
Elizabeth Colley - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And one more question. How should we think about wage inflation for the rest of the year? And what do you guys think the margin impact, what do you expect it to be this year, and even looking into next year?
Ilya Cantor: I think it's a little bit too early to -- and we don't guide to wage inflation. So we had our main wage inflation cycle come through in January. It was within expectations. The competitive environment continues to be challenging, as it is for all the players in our industry, whether it's in India, China, Russia or wherever else. So the best we can say is that we're continuing to see wage inflation in a competitive environment, the stack up according to, more or less of how we predicted it. But for the rest of your, we'll see how it goes.
Operator: Mr. Dobkin, there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you. Thank you, everybody for attending our call today. In summary, we're pleased with the results of the previous quarter, and we feel good about the next quarter and for the 2013, at least, as it sounds for right now. So we look forward to talking to you next time and provide additional updates like in approaching within 3 months. So thank you for attending and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the EPAM Systems Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Farrell Kramer from the Investor Relations team. Thank you. Mr. Kramer, you may begin comp.
Farrell Kramer: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received the copy of the earnings release for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2012 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, www.epam.com, together with our supplemental data sheet. The speakers we have on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Ilya Cantor, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Arkadiy Dobkin. Please go ahead, Arkadiy.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, and hello, everyone. 2012 was a year of significant accomplishments for EPAM. In our first year as a public company, we increased revenues by 30%. We increased adjusted net income by 22%, while continuing to make significant investments for future growth including the addition of our 1500 IT professionals. And we completed 2 strategically important acquisitions: Thoughtcorp in May and Empathy Lab in December. And we continue to execute on our strategy to become a world-class provider of complex software engineering solutions and emerging technology services. Last year on our first quarter and our first post-IPO earnings call, I talked about the key elements of our long-term growth strategy. And today, I am pleased to review our progress. First, we said we would continue building on our culture of innovation, technology leadership and process excellence to develop strong competencies that would help us deepen and extend our services into key vertical markets. Let's talk a bit more about the subject because it's a key driving force to our growth. During the last 12 months we invested significantly in today's most demanding technology domains such as Enterprise Mobility, Cloud deployment, Big Data, Enterprise Content Management, Business Intelligence and eCommerce. The results of these efforts were recognized by a number of independent publications in the industry on [indiscernible] . For example, Zinnov, a leading globalization and market expansion advisory firm named EPAM as a global R&D and product development services leader in the enterprise and consumer software markets. As well as the Enterprise Mobility and Cloud Verticals. Global Services Magazine included EPAM in the top 10 leaders of its global product development category within its Global Services 100 ranking. Finally, just this week, Everest Group included EPAM in its major contenders category within its key metrics which recognizes and ranks capital market service providers according to scale, scope, demand investment and market success and delivery capabilities. Everest also highlighted EPAM as a star performer, which is a rare classification shared only with 2 other major players. Most importantly, recognition of our achievements were clearly and publicly validated by many of our top accounts. Let me share just a few of those which we are allowed to disclose. Hotels.com, which has been with us from 2007, confirm our status as a strategic delivery partner based on our deep understanding of the travel industry and our tailored agile approach. Chevron, a new client, agreed to co-present with us at the Gartner Strategic Partnerships Summit in Orlando to share how the world's leading integrated energy companies utilize value-added services from their key partners. Sephora Americas, the North American division of the world's leading retailer of cosmetic and beauty products, selected EPAM to help launch the next-generation version of Sephora.com, a new resource that Sephora its social and mobile makeover, which together with new iPhone and iPad applications complete the solution to provide the best-in-class online shopping experience. TriZetto Corporation, a healthcare IT company, with solutions touch over half of the U.S. insured population and reach more than 200,000 care providers, was looking for a partner that has strong product engineering capabilities, and selected EPAM because of our track record coupled with our deep experience in Microsoft technologies, BI/Big Data and Agile development. These are just a few examples of why a company select EPAM. The common thread is that they come to us to help meet an ever-increasing mandate, to build new sophisticated solutions that rely on a number of emerging competencies in technology platforms, while still reducing time to market and managing course. This contributed to revenues from 3 out of our 4 verticals growing more than 20% in 2012 and overall revenue growth of 30%. The second key element of our long-term growth strategy that we discussed a year ago said that we were in position to take advantage of the growing demand for qualitative services in Europe and we did. Our European business grew almost 45% in 2012 and accounted for 35.8% of our total revenues up from 32% last year. Third, we talked about the importance of attracting and retaining a quality workforce. Again, in 2012, at approximately 11%, our attrition rate was amongst the lowest in the industry. Fourth, we posted a 27% increase in revenues from ISV or independent software vendors. This is a core differentiating vertical for EPAM, the foundation for our business and represented 25% of our 2012 revenue. Our strong long-term relationships with ISVs and the knowledge we have gained working with them, have enabled us to: Number one, to demonstrate a confirmation of our excellency in software engineering culture; two, successfully expand in key vertical markets; and three, deepen our existing client relationships. Finally, we discussed last year making acquisitions that would expand our geographic footprint, complement our global delivery capabilities and deepen our industry knowledge and technical capabilities. In May of 2012 we acquired Thoughtcorp, based in Toronto, which extend our North America presence as well as further develop our capabilities within several important competencies. As a confirmation of our strategy, we won a large key account that neither company could have achieved alone. In mid-December, we acquired Empathy Lab, a digital strategy and multichannel experience design firm, that is a recognized leader in both e-Commerce and digital media and entertainment space. The combination of their front-end digital capabilities and now proven strengths in global delivery of complex software engineering, puts us in the strong position to offer end-to-end cutting edge e-Commerce solutions. We are currently working closely with them on important integration efforts as well as business development programs to take advantage of near-term growth and selling opportunities. All in all, we achieved what we set out to do in 2012. Looking forward, we are confident that our growth momentum will continue in 2013 and beyond. We will continue to invest in the development of technical capabilities, further develop our on-site presence in both organic and non-organic opportunities, to expand our scope of services, complement existing technical expertise and add new vertical markets. With that, I will turn the call over to Ilya for the financial review.
Ilya Cantor: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. As detailed in our press release, our fourth quarter revenue grew 14% sequentially and 32% over last year to $125.5 million, ahead of the top end of our guidance of $118 million. Overall, 2012 was another strong year for us. We grew revenues by 29.7% year-on-year or 31.4% on a constant currency basis, while growing adjusted net income by 21.6% and maintaining a healthy balance sheet. For the fourth quarter, Banking & Financial Services increased 57.4% year-over-year and represented 28.4% of revenues. ISV & Technology was up 34.1% from quarter 4 of 2011 to account for a 24.4% of total. We have recently combined our Travel and Hospitality and Retail and Consumer verticals into one, as it more appropriately represents the common technological needs of those customers and markets . Travel and Consumer increased 19.9% and was 21.5% of revenue. You can find the historical data for the merged vertical on our data sheet in the Investor Relations section of our website. Business Information & Media was down 9.8% in the quarter, accounting for 11.5% of total revenue. However, excluding the decline at Thomson Reuters, this vertical would be up 33.9%. For the fourth quarter, our European revenue was up 33.4% of total, up 38.7%. North America represented 44.7% of revenue, up 22.3%. Finally, CIS represented 19.2% of total, up 47.6%. 91.9% and 82% of our revenues in 2012 came from clients who had used our services for at least 1 and 2 years, respectively. We have talked about growing new clients into significant relationships for us and we were successful in this effort during 2012. In 2011, we had 54 clients that generated at least $1 million in revenues with us. For 2012, that number increased more than 50% to 81. At the same time, we remained diversified. No single client accounted for more than 10% of our revenues this past year, and our top 5 clients represented 31% and our top 10, 44.4%. Turning to costs, cost of revenue exclusive of depreciation and amortization was $77.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, an increase of 30.1% over the $59.4 million reported in the last year period. For the full year, cost of revenues increased 31.7%. These increases are primarily due to higher compensation of benefits associated with the increase in IT professionals throughout the year, as well as an increase in incentive compensation. Cost of revenue excluding stock comp cost was $77 million in the fourth quarter and $267.6 million in 2012. Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $26.4 million and $85.9 million for full year 2012. Growth in SG&A was due to increased overhead in non-production staff necessary to support the growth of this business. SG&A as percent of revenue was 19.8% for 2012, up slightly from 19.4% in 2011. Or I should mentioned that in SG&A, in 2012, we had incremental stock comp cost of $2.5 million and approximately $1 million in incremental public company cost. Depreciation expense for 2012 was $10.9 million, a 44.4% increase over 2011. The increase in depreciation is due to additional CapEx for equipment to support the growth in headcount as well as the amortization of intangibles from the Thoughtcorp acquisition. Non-GAAP income from operations was $20.6 million for the fourth quarter representing a 26% gain over the fourth quarter of the previous year and $74.9 million for 2012, an increase of 23.1% from 2011. For the fourth quarter of 2012, non-GAAP operating margins were 16.4%, within our target range down slightly from the 17.1% a year ago, mainly as a result of 2 items: First of all, our performance this year was better than expected and as a result, we increased our bonus accruals in the fourth quarter. Second, we won a project with one of Russia's leading consumer-electronic retail chains. As part of the implementation we hired a U.K.-based firm, specializing high-end ATG e-Commerce implementations on a subcontract basis, to perform the initial phase of the project in Q4. So this is basically a pasture of revenues for the work done in the fourth quarter. So this part of the project has been completed, and going forward, we'll receive a more normalized margin on this project. Net interest income was $0.4 million for the quarter and $1.5 million for the full year. Foreign exchange loss was about $100,000 for the quarter and $2.1 million for the year. Non-GAAP net income or net income excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisition cost, amortization of acquisition and intangibles and stock-based comp was $17 million for the quarter or $0.37 per diluted share, up 23.3% versus the $0.30 diluted earnings per share in quarter 4 of 2011. For the full year, non-GAAP net income was $65.5 million or $1.42 per diluted share versus the $1.19 in 2011. Now let's look at the balance sheet. We ended the year with $118 million dollars in cash. Cash from operating activities was $48.5 million, down from $54.5 million in 2011. This was due to higher bonus payments for 2011 performance prior to the IPO that were paid in 2012. Net cash of $59.6 million was used in investing activities during 2012, primarily for the construction of new facilities in Belarus and for the acquisitions of Thoughtcorp and Empathy Lab. Net cash provided by financing activities was $38.8 million, primarily due to funds received in connection with the IPO. Capital expenditures for 2012 were $26.7 million, of which $13.4 million was for the new facility in Belarus. Accounts receivable were $78.9 million at the end of 2012, up 32.7% over 2011. We finished the quarter with a DSO, day sales outstanding, of 56 days compared to 58 days last quarter. Turning to 2013 and our guidance, based on our current visibility and market conditions, we expect a year-over-year revenue growth in the range of 23% to 25%. Non-GAAP net income growth for 2013 is expected to be in the range of 12% to 15% with an effective tax rate of approximately 20%. I'd like to point out that our effective tax rate, for modeling purposes, has increased from 17.3% in 2012 to 20% going forward, mostly due to the 2 acquisitions that we made in North America. However, I should also mention that as both acquisitions were asset purchases, while the effective tax rate did not benefit, we do get a real benefit in terms of cash tax savings from amortizing the intangibles against our tax liability. For the first quarter of 2013, we expect revenue between $122 million and $125 billion, representing growth rate of 29% to 31% over the first quarter of 2012 revenue, which includes results from 2 acquisitions made in 2012 that were not in the comparable period. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.32 to $0.34 based on first quarter 2013 weighted average of $47.6 million diluted shares. Lastly, capital expenditures for 2013 will be approximately $25 million, of which $19 million is to support continued growth in the business excluding spend on IT equipment, and leasehold improvements and other capital purchases. Also included in that is $6 million to complete the construction of our new facility in Belarus. With that, I would like to turn the call back to the operator to open it up for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Question, it seems that guidance for the year is based on a higher effective tax rate. Can you comment on that a little bit?
Ilya Cantor: Hi Moshe, yes -- this is Ilya. We made 2 acquisitions in 2012 that are North America in particular. And what that does is that it has the impact of driving our effective tax rate. In particular, the acquisition of Empathy Labs that we made in December of 2012 pushes our tax rate from what we saw in 2012 of 17.3% to close to 20%, and the acquisition made in Toronto in May of 2012 also has a much more smaller impact but yet it does have an impact. So this is why we're projecting a higher tax rate because North American acquisitions tend to drive the effective tax rate. I should say -- and as I said in the script, we do get a real cash tax benefit because both of those acquisitions were asset purchases rather than stock purchases. Unfortunately, the effective tax rate we'll report on the P&L does not get recognition of that tax benefit.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: And then again, a couple of more questions, with -- looking at guidance. What sort of inorganic revenues are included in your guidance for the year? I.e. how much in revenue contribution are you going to get from both of those of acquisition for the year?
Ilya Cantor: So, let me just preface this by saying that first of all, the acquisition of Thoughtcorp, the Canadian consultancy in May of 2012, is almost fully integrated. The acquisition of Empathy Labs in December, it is well underway in terms of integration. The -- one of the main strategies in doing these 2 acquisitions was that we could supplement their front-end, their consulting expertise, their on-site with our global delivery platform to where 1 and 1 make 3. So with that, Thoughtcorp is almost entirely insipid [ph]. It's close to impossible to break out, on a standalone basis, the revenue contribution for Thoughtcorp either in '12 or '13. And with Empathy Labs, it is likewise very difficult. We've already started [indiscernible] joint projects where we have our people working on their customers. We have their people helping out our customers. It's getting very, very, very diffuse if you will. But what we can say is particularly look -- it will help if you guys look at our estimates for Q1 of 2013, if that's up against an easy comp in Q1 of 2012 where there was no impact of those 2 acquisitions. What we can say is, those 2 acquisitions combined did approximately $7 million in Q1 of 2012, so before they were acquired. So hopefully that gives you a kind of like a way to help figure out at least the relative materiality of these. Again, the broad intent to make these acquisitions is the thing that makes it very difficult to split out going forward.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay and then what sort of -- how should we think about adjusted EBIT margins this year and then your free cash flow generation this year as well?
Ilya Cantor: So Moshe as you know we don't guide to margins.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Are we going to be flat year-over-year? Is there any -- or is there anything that you can talk about in terms of trends?
Ilya Cantor: We continue to reinvest into the business and we're consistent with what we said before. We're continuing to invest in putting more specialized, more experienced resources on-site next to our clients in order to drive future revenue growth. Second, we continue to invest in our competency [ph] centers to make sure that we can offer our existing clients the most cutting-edge technologies possible, as well as to make sure that we can use these technologies and increased our [ph] efforts. And therefore, again, drive for the revenue growth. There's a third dimension, part of the investment is that you maintain a slightly bigger bench going into 2013, we're probably 100 basis points to 200 basis points below our normal range. That's part of the reinvestment. This is to train people. And as part of the initiative again, we're investing in the business to drive future revenue growth.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. So margin should be, from a trend perspective, down slightly year-over-year? Is there anything you can say about that? I just -- we just want to make sure that -- I don't think anybody is going to -- we don't want get anybody surprised, again later to be positively.
Ilya Cantor: Again, we don't give guidance to margins. I mean, we feel pretty good about 2013. It's another good normal year.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Moshe, listen, we kept to like to see what's happening around us right now. We see a lot of demands for new type of technologies. Like clients are actually, why we're growing so much because clients rely on us to do some work which we know the company is going to do. We -- we're growing clearly faster than the general electrical company in our segment. And to do this, we have to differentiate ourselves from skills. We have very good base [ph] on this, we've talked about it many times from in the past about our focus on may I see [ph] and how it's helping us. But at the same technology changes so fast and some demand for understanding specific businesses require from us doing the work. We're doing this because we do believe that at some point it would give us better rates and better margins. But when this right going for negotiation or getting this record happened, we don't know. So that's why you're asking what would we be doing in the next couple of years? We're going to grow, that's what we can say. We're going to focus on specific technology, et cetera, which we've highlighted. That's what we can say. We do believe that it would give us advantage against competitors. When that happening this year or the next year that's what we can kind of tell you. And we will adjust our projections like at each quarter versus what you've see quarter. This is the best we can do right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman from Stifel.
David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Maybe just to expand a little bit on Moshe's questions. It looks like obviously, you're getting very strong top line growth and in fact, the gross margin remains fairly strong. So it would appear that there was obviously a fairly significant sequential spike in SG&A and there may be a seasonal element of that for some bonus accrual. But it was like 25% sequentially in dollars and again, as kind of Moshe was referring to the guide for '13, would seem to imply that the G&A may or SG&A may stay at elevated levels through the year. So I think Ilya, you referenced a couple of points about what's going on in G&A. Perhaps you can help us again by just reviewing what impacted the fourth quarter? And in fact, what may impact next year as well? Because it sounds like the one retailer that were ramping in the quarter, if you're hiring subs, that would -- I would like at least intuitively that would have more impact on the gross margin and cost to revenue rather than G&A. But -- I mean, I may not be thinking about it right. So if you could perhaps just go through that attendant, that'd be great! could just go through with that again?
Ilya Cantor: Sure. I will try. So SG&A as I mentioned has, for 2012, an additional $2.5 million in stock compensation costs as compared to prior year and has an extra $1 million in public company costs. Our total public company costs are approximately $2 million. But compared to 2011, it's an extra million. And so it's $3.5 million of additional cost in SG&A right there, which means that if you do factors those out, our SG&A, as percent of revenue, would go down in 2012 versus 2011. And so far as the question about the subcontractor specializing in Oracle, our commerce platform and presentations [ph] that we got for the commerce project in Russia. Yes, I mean, that had a negative impact on Q4, because it was essentially dollar for dollar with a revenue that we recognized in Q4 for that particular project. And yes, the subcontracting cost did go into the gross margin. I'm sorry, did you have a third question?
David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Well, I think if you look at the adjusted operating margin which factors out stock-based comp, the adjusted operating margin did kind of decline below 17%, I think it's about 16.4%., which is lower than it has been. So like I said, given the strengths in the gross margin, even despite that subcontracting cost it appears the operating cost are higher and I'm just trying to understand what are the moving pieces there that are driving that increase, which again, already factors out both stock-based comp as well as the item that we talked about with a ramping of the new customer.
Ilya Cantor: Well, let me address first just the operating margin. And what we see is, I think -- let's make sure, we have the right numbers is 17.3% adjusted operating margin in 2012. Is that what you have?
David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I've got that as the adjusted EBITDA margin but perhaps for our perhaps mixing terminology here.
Ilya Cantor: That may be a disconnect then, because income from operations is 17.3%, close to $75 million. And Ark did you want to say something?
Arkadiy Dobkin: David, as a G&A equation -- like, this number is approximately flat, the relative numbers. But if you think about the -- I can give you kind of explanation which is probably difficult to quantify, but we were talking about the history of the company where everyone was focusing so much on engineering coming from certain ISVs for a long time. And that's what we were sharing for the last year when we become probably public that we need to invest a lot in sales structure, in account management structure, because that's a component of EPAM which is way underdeveloped over the years. The same like pro forma HR and recruitment infrastructures as well. So we're growing very fast. As you know like before this year, we were growing 2 years for -- by 50% and that's only happening based on our reputation and our technology advanced skills. So we're clearly going to different -- a little bit different space right now where our vertical industries starting to drive. And where relationship of these clients should be done very differently. So we are investing a lot in account management, sales and human resources and recruitment. And it's all coming to SG&A. So for some time, it would be kind of growing particularly in line with the company. Again, we do believe that it will bring benefits later on. When it's exactly would be happening, so we will talk to you again. [indiscernible] Adjusted by quarter-by-quarter. And this topic you know, is we discussed this with everybody, because everybody was questioning how fast we can grow using new sales. So we invest here and to existing clients as well.
David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I think I understand that better. And just in -- Ilya just a follow-up question on the tax rate. So as the revenues ramp and I guess as you integrate these and get more back in revenue, does the tax will come back down or is 20% more or less a steady state to think about for the foreseeable future here?
Ilya Cantor: We look at it as a steady state for the foreseeable future. If we do make further acquisitions in North America then that does tend to have a negative impact on the stated effective tax rate, although again the cash tax rates benefits we -- we continue to somehow make these asset purchases and that's a pretty huge benefit in cash terms. But also, if you -- the benefits that we have from acquisition, from Empathy Labs for instance, their on-site rates blended with our offshore rates. This is going to help us in terms of overall yields. Whether that's going to fall this side of the border or that side of the border we still have to sort out and it depends on the engagement, right? So it's hard to say. So for now, we're going to stick with 20%.
David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. Got it. And just one last question. I know your -- one of your big media clients, obviously, they were about of a yo-yo over the course of 2012, do you feel that the exit rate in the fourth quarter is a steady state for that client? Or do you think you're going to see more volatility in 2013?
Ilya Cantor: It's hard to say right now what's going to happen. We don't know beyond what we've been told. Right now it's relatively stable. We actually we're able to put through a pretty decent rate increase because as you know we have this client had been with us for 12 or 13 years, and therefore had some of the lower rates. So we think that's a pretty good vote of vote of confidence for the type of skills sets that they're using and need to use in the future. But we can't obviously talk to what they're going through internally which drives some of the stuff.
Operator: Our next question comes the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.
Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Can you guys just comment on some of the -- the dynamics in some of your largest clients. It looks like the contribution to revenue -- I may have missed this earlier, but some of the contribution to revenue from your top 5 has dropped pretty considerably sequentially from last quarter to this quarter being in the less-20% range. What drove that and how was the demand environment among the top qualified top 10 clients?
Ilya Cantor: Actually, probably, some of the decline that you mentioned relates to the client we just talked about with David. But we still see -- actually just to give you a sense of the impact of this large client had on our business. In terms of Business Information & Media, we reported for the full year that it's was down slightly. It'd be up 29%, if you exclude entirely the impact of this client. For the quarter instead of down 9.8%, Business Information & Media segment would be up 34%. In terms of the top 5, I don't have it with and without, but we think actually the top 5 in 2012, the contribution for year-on-year growth from top 5, it was 25.5% and that's fairly good. From top 10, it was 29.1%. To us, that's -- well, we grew 30%. So this is fairly good as well. So besides this -- our client, which we keep talking about. We feel fairly good about everyone else in our top 10 accounts --that
Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just a quick question on sales and distribution. Again, I brought this up with you guys before but I'm always impressed by the amount of referral business you have rather than direct sales, and it might just be the nature of the headboard you do. But I've been curious with your -- I mean, what is the sales channel look like for you? I mean, obviously, there's been a lot of discussion on this conference call around build-on expenses and margins. And I mean, if we had -- I'd like to, at some point, have a better understanding of when we might be able to see operating earnings grow at a similar pace as revenue which I'm sure everyone on this call wants to hear at some point. The call as the some point. But on that note, I mean is there a build-out in sales going underway? I mean, are you still growing your revenue primarily from At least organic revenue primarily from revenue business Dor minute the number primarily from referral business? Or have you seen more sales contribution?
Arkadiy Dobkin: So clearly that, that is changing. We're going to first off all, it's still more than around 90% of our business coming from the clients, which we already create within the previous 12 months, and this is probably pretty typical for our business. So there is still a big number of referrals, and I don't want to excuse it Darrin, we're actually proud it's happening. At the same time, we're seeing a lot of pickup in our channel sales where, like -- we were talking about how ISV influenced generally [indiscernible] business and how some clients from ISV and a specific technology and solutions which we helped them to develop, creating a channel for us and it is a growing size of the company to be coming much more available partner for large software and technology companies. We're seeing this growth in e-Commerce space and Business Intelligence space, which is openings for us doors to large corporates, and then you can see the sales multiple line of services which will where working on. So this is happening much more than it happened just 12 months ago. And the directs sales also is starting to work more effectively but we still have a long way to go to, to be a really good there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I guess, let me start with Ilya, I may have missed this, but what is your cash tax rate?
Ilya Cantor: It's approximately 15%.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Okay. The second question I have is with regards to the contract sizes, the contracts you have signed. Are you, from a macro standpoint or client-specific standpoint, are you seeing any change that could be construed as what is some, in terms of the ramping, existing clients or project activity or anything like that, is it pretty much in a good, strong secular team continues to work for you plus the execution?
Ilya Cantor: Ashwin and I would say that we see -- we don't, we don't see much change. It's is very similar to what it was before. And there is no any visible slow down for us right now. So basically that's what we were repeated during the last previous quarters, and I think it's true right now as well.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Good to know...
Arkadiy Dobkin: And as you know, we were working a little bit like it's difficult to compare us with much bigger companies We're competing for different type of deals. We have different entrance points and I think it's actually differentiate us because we're doing a little bit different type of work than most of our regularized competitors.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: No. I understood, absolutely. But I just had to ask the question because a couple of your larger competitors are large banks and they have seen headcount cuts and we do get to question from investors. So it's good to see that your plan continue to be quite good. Now not to beat a dead horse but going back to margins, at the time of IPO, if I'm not mistaken, while you don't provide short-term margins items or annual margins items, I think you did you did or you had put long-term 16% to 18% range out there. And based on this [indiscernible] backtracking from your numbers, it seems like its [indiscernible] all though slightly lower than the 17.3%. Just want to understand are you still consistent with long-term 16% to 18%.
Ilya Cantor: I think for the long-term we're still consistent with that mid-teen to upper-teen range for adjusted income from operations or adjusted operating margins. Again, not to restate what we said before, about reinvesting into the business but the business is growing at a rate of 25% to 30%. Of course, we're guiding 23% to 25%. Last year, it grew 30%. I think this is on top of the heap, right, Ashwin?
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes.
Ilya Cantor: It's difficult to say whether its margins are going to be 16.2%, 15.5%, 17.8%, we're going to be around that range but we're continuing to reinvest into the business. And it may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. We're focusing on running the business the way the business should be run and you may see fluctuations quarter-to-quarter even year-to-year. But again the intent is to drive further revenue growth.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. I guess last question, FX, I must have missed that -- it's little bit more difficult to predict, but what's a good number to go with, in terms of where you are currently with your projects, located -- project locations and so on and so forth? And any change to your original intent to basically not really hedge?
Ilya Cantor: Obviously it's difficult or impossible to project future currency moves, otherwise I would be in that line of business. But looking at 2012 say versus 2011, we did have roughly $5.5 million to $6 million negative impact on revenues. In other words, revenue growth would have been even higher by about 130 basis points, I think. However, as we said before and as reaffirmation of the statement, the impact on margins, it has actually been positive even though the impact of revenues have been negative. So we think our mix continues to provide us with relatives certainty now. This is not an absolute guarantee that this point to happen in the future. But we continue to look at this month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter, we discussed it with the board. We think our value at risk is manageable at this time. So we're not going to hedge in the near future higher or if continue to accumulate more and more, say euro-based, ruble-based or pound-based revenues which would tip the scales to a level that we find unacceptable then we will contemplate then turning to hedges. But at this time, no.
Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And last question, I promise. As you think of the quarters for this year, is it safe to assume, consistent with historical patterns you gained strength as you go from Q1 to Q2 to Q3 and so on?
Ilya Cantor: I think the seasonal pattern we had before should probably hold true. Obviously, you have to be careful with percentages, right? Because look at Q4 of 2012 that's going to be a tough comp, as you had an extra $8 million of revenues and there are stuff that doesn't necessarily recur. So we should have a good steady [indiscernible] percentage growth in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 it's going to be a little bit below to come up to that 23%, 25% target.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Vengranovich with OTKRITIE Capital.
Alexander Vengranovich - OTKRITIE Securities Ltd., Research Division: Actually I noticed that the share of fixed-price contracts is constantly increasing. I'm just wondering whether you're making this deliberately or it's the market trends and whether you'll be able to move forward in the future to improve your gross margin from the back of more fusion service of the clients. That's the first question. And second, regarding the headcount growth, what sort of headcounts increase for 2013 should be planned in order to support such a high growth rates of your revenue?
Ilya Cantor: Alexander, so on fixed fees, I think it's not constantly increasing. What we're seeing is that roughly 85%-15% split. We think that’s within the normal range of time and materials versus fixed fees, now you may see a couple of hundred bps here and there. When we get into new clients or new significant projects, typically it's on the fixed fee basis. When we prove ourselves, the client themselves tend to convert the contract type to time and material, essentially letting us guide the engagement and therefore it becomes more of a recurring stable revenue scheme, even though the underlying work is project-based. So sort of the nominal fluctuations you see in fixed fees versus T&M, to us are not meaningful, or at least not indicative of some adverse trend. On your second question about gross margins, again, not to sort of restate the things we've said before about reinvesting into the business for future revenue growth, business that's growing 23%, 25%, 30%, we're going to continue to invest into the business. On your third question about headcount growth, there's a lot of dependencies there probably. If we are going by 23% to 25%, we think roughly 15% headcount growth would be in the ballpark. So hopefully that answers your questions.
Arkadiy Dobkin: But also when bring in new people on board there is an approximately 50-50 split between people coming from what it is like, more doing is less and people coming from the market and it's -- when you put in projections for the next year, it's driving a lot of our understanding, what would be not in the next quarter or 2, what would be in the next 9 or 12 months. That's why this number could be adjusted during the year because we're investing for this 50% of the people, we invest in a lot schemes -- specific trainings. So this number will be fluctuate during the year.
Alexander Vengranovich - OTKRITIE Securities Ltd., Research Division: And also one more question, just really quickly. You have any M&A's in the pipeline that you can comment on?
Ilya Cantor: We typically cannot comment on any M&A in the pipeline but obviously since -- ever since the time we went public and one of the reasons for going public is to get the higher profile and the currency for M&A. We have been literally deluged with inbound M&A inquiries. So we're in a good high-class position to be able to be selective about that acquisition that we do make. As evidenced by the 2 really good acquisitions we made in 2012. And so we're going to continue to look to do those kinds of acquisitions in the future.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Moshe Katri from Cowen.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Just another question, prior 2012 your financial services vertical was exceptionally strong and obviously that was unusual for -- compared to your peers. Can we talk about some of those trends in terms of what's driving growth? What has been driving growth in financial services? And then what are your expectations for this vertical in 2013?
Arkadiy Dobkin: I think, actually, I'll repeat myself from the previous calls. But I would like to bring again the attention that we're doing a little bit different type of work. The financial services we're outsourcing is [indiscernible] and that's why even if some companies say in the news that financial services might be going down. In our case is actually taken still growing even in a fled-budget situation. Some of the clients in this space shared this asset when we entered this segment like 4, 5 years ago and had almost 0 revenue, of the competitors had like used to count with million from one client. And today we're actually on par in the same budgets. So basically they decrease, and we are increasing. So I think focus on specific [indiscernible] conflicts, development plus in some situation, be in Europe, which is advantage for European capital market and [indiscernible] systems given this advantage. And right now, it's in pretty strong demand for the services. So you should expect similar growth.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, as we've come to the end of our time for Q&A, I'd like to turn the floor back to Mr. Dobkin for closing comments.
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, everybody, for attending our call today. So I would sum up that we do believe that we achieved our goals for 2012 and we're pretty confident that we can continue our growth momentum in 2013. We still going to invest a lot in improving our technologies, capabilities because we do think it's one of the main differentiating factor in our segment. We can do better and more complex work than most of our competitors. So we're going to look for organic and non-organic opportunities to do this, to expand our scope of services, complement technical expertise and entering new markets. So it's all in our plans. So I look forward talking to you next quarter and provide the next update. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-11-09 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to EPAM's 2012 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and we have allocated 1 hour for prepared remarks and Q&A. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Richard Zubeck [ph], Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Unknown Executive: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2012 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, www.epam.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Ilya Cantor, Chief Financial Officer.
 Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.
 I would now like to turn the call over to Arkadiy Dobkin. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Richard. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2012 earnings call. I will discuss highlights from the quarter, our key achievements, and provide an update on our guidance. After that, I will turn it over to Ilya for a more in-depth review of the third quarter financials. 
 So, we are pleased to report another strong quarter. Our revenue grew 6% sequentially and over 27% year-over-year to $110.1 million. Non-GAAP income from operations increased 6% to $19.2 million. The non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were at $0.37. This performance confirms our unique value proposition which comes from almost 20 years of software product engineering experience, continuing focus on expanding the [indiscernible] and technology domains knowledge and our ability to attract and retain the best [indiscernible] talent [indiscernible]. 
 In Q3, we continued to benefit from growing trends across European companies that had turned into high-value-add nearshore strategic partners to help drive efficiency and optimizing their IT spend. Compared to the third quarter of last year, revenue from clients located in Europe expanded 46%. Banking & Financial and Retail and Consumer verticals were the 2 largest contributors to our growth in Europe. Within North America, which continues to be our largest market, we also had good traction and increased revenue by 27%, driven by both existing and new clients. ISVs & Technology vertical was the largest contributors to our growth in North America. 
 In the CIS regions, revenue was down slightly, in line with our expectations for this region. We also saw continuing growth across most of our verticals. ISV & Technology had a strong quarter and grew 33%, which includes the impact of several clients added in result of third quarter acquisitions. Results in each of the vertical increased by 26%. In addition to consistent performance from our existing clients, we have had solid new business development in this sector over the past several quarters. Banking & Financial services performed exceptionally well, with 50% growth. We continue to expand our partnership with several large financial institutions which look to us for both traditional IT Outsourcing services, as well as the services [indiscernible] new technology domain, as mobile, cloud computing and high-performance realtime analytics and business intelligence.
 In the Retail and Consumer vertical, we continue to outperform the market which resulted in revenue growth of 65% while in Travel and Hospitality, it declined 50% [ph] . So combined, this consumer-oriented segment grew by 20% for us in Q3. 
 As you know, this industry segment is moving to a new model where marketing decision makers are dramatically shifting their spend into digital world, to create more integrated brand stories and developing differentiated experiences across a variety of connected systems and devices. Many of the world's leading brands are allowing EPAM to build systems that extend their reach through an ever-increasing mix of interactive and social applications. And three, while our gross exposure to a number of cutting-edge emerging technologies in result of our further development for [indiscernible] uniquely position to help companies expand and to revolutionize the business model. 
 Our Business Information & Media vertical was down 4% year-over-year, due to the planned ramp-down at Thomson Reuters. Excluding this single client, this vertical have grown 24% primarily through successful new client acquisitions with several big names in the entertainment and media space. 
 In the same quarter last year, we have had a number of new wins which we are particularly excited about. While we cannot go into specific names, I would say that we have acquired highly strategic accounts in nearly every sector in which we compete. We also saw strong growth within our existing client base with 89% and 76% revenues coming from clients that have used our services for at least 1 year and 2 years, respectively. This again confirms the high quality of our services and the loyal nature of our customer base. 
 In resources, we had a net increase of about 1,600 IT professionals over the past year or roughly 24% growth and ended the quarter with over 8,100 engineers while we continue maintaining one of the lowest attrition rates in the industry. 
 Turning to the outlook. As we spoke last quarter, we anticipated cost and services from Thomson Reuters with foreign currency headwinds to inevitably impact our full year results by $5 million to $6 million. Thomson Reuters' cuts were almost exactly in line with our expectations. However, we have transported the people to new and other growing accounts, which in turn are exceeding our newer expectation for growth in Q4. At this point, we had better than expected performance in several new accounts, as well as better-than-anticipated performance in numerous existing accounts, virtually across every vertical we have. A lot of that we've seen in budget as a budget flush. Foreign currency exchange rates improved a little from the last time we spoke because it benefited our revenue as well as at several hundred thousand dollars.
 Lastly, we've seen better than originally anticipated results in financial sector in CIS region. Based on this, we are revising our full year revenue outlook to be from $423 million to $426 million, which represents year-on-year growth of approximately 27%. This is an increase from our prior guidance of $412 million to $418 million. Also raising our earnings growth expectation to be 18% to 20% for the year from 16% to 18%, as I've previously guided. 
 With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ilya, who will walk you through financial results. Ilya? 
Ilya Cantor: Thank you, Arkadiy, and good morning, everyone. After my comments, we will open the call for questions. In addition to my comments here, we're now providing a supplemental fact sheet on our website with detailed information about our revenues and results of operations, including information about our verticals, geographies and service offerings. As Arkadiy highlighted, Q3 was another strong quarter. We grew revenue 6% sequentially and 27% over last year to $110 million, which is above the top end of our guidance of $109 million. Earnings per share were $0.37, also above our prior guidance of $0.36 per share. 
 And our outlook, during our Second Quarter Earnings Call, we identified 2 areas of concern that caused us to lower our revenue expectations for 2012.  At first, we had anticipated $2 million to $3 million in additional reductions from Thomson Reuters and also a potential $3 million impact from currency on our revenues. While the Thomson Reuters reductions are proceeding as we had expected, currency did not impact revenues by as much as we initially anticipated. More importantly, as Ark said, we are also seeing very strong momentum across virtually all of our key verticals and target geographies. 
 With that, we now expect quarter 4 revenues of between $115 million to $118 million which represents year-on-year growth of 21% to 24% and sequential growth of 4% to 7%. We also expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.37 per share for quarter 4 with an expected share count of 47.4 million and tax rate of approximately 17%. For the full year, we expect revenues to be between $423 million to $426 million, which represents growth of approximately 27%. On a full year basis, we're also raising adjusted earnings growth to be in the range of 18% to 20%, with an assumed tax rate of 16% to 17%. 
 On the rest of the results, we continue to maintain our lower revenue concentration, with our Top 5 and Top 10 clients accounting for 32% and 45% of total revenue in the quarter, respectively, compared to 32% and 44% in the preceding quarter. On material contracts, we're 85% revenues in the third quarter versus 87% same quarter last year. Fixed fee revenues represented 14% of total revenues in the third quarter versus 10% in Q3 last year. 
 Turning to our cost. Cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization in the third quarter was $69 million, representing an increase of 34%, from $51.6 million in the third quarter of 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to a net increase of nearly 1,600 IT professionals from September 30, 2011, to September 30, 2012, or an average growth of 24%. Gross margins, excluding stock compensation of $1 million, were 38.2% compared to 40.7% last year, which is within our target range of 36% to 40%. SG&A in the third quarter was 19% of revenues up from 18% in the third quarter of 2011, but down from 20% in Q2. Depreciation and amortization expense was $3 million, up from $2.1 million reported in the third quarter of 2011, which was primarily due to amortization of intangibles from the acquisition of Thoughtcorp in Q2 this year. 
 GAAP income from operations was $16.7 million, a decrease of 0.9% compared to $16.9 million in the third quarter of 2011 with non-GAAP income from operations of $19.2 million which is an increase of almost 6%, compared to $18.1 million in the third quarter of 2011. Net income for the quarter was $14.1 million, representing growth of 28% [ph]  Year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $17.2 million, a year-over-year decline of 2%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.37, compared to $0.39 last year. However, the $0.02 decline was due to a higher share count of approximately 1 million shares this quarter and a lower tax rate in year-ago quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted share count used for the third quarter of 2012 was $46.5 million compared to $45.4 million in the same quarter last year. 
 Lastly, our balance sheet remains very healthy. As of September 30, we had $106 million in cash. During the quarter, net cash provided by operations was $11.1 million. We finished the quarter with a DSO of 58 days compared to 51 days in the second quarter of this year. During the quarter, we had $14.1 million in capital expenditures, which approximately $10 million was for progress payments for construction of our new facility in Belarus.
 We will now open the call up for question-and-answer session. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen. 
Moshe Katri: Tremendous growth in financial services. I think it will be helpful Arkadiy if you just talk about what's driving that growth? Is it new logos, is it existing logos and maybe talk a bit about the nature of the work. And then I have another follow on. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: We have several very strong strategic relationships in financial services. And with all difficulties which this industry is facing right now, we're actually seeing a good opportunity for us because type of services and kind of expertise we can provide. So the growth relates to several very large accounts, which is growing with us but it is also partially relates to kind of a recovery of financial services in the former Soviet Union region which we mentioned last time that it's -- was kind of question of us, how successful it's going to be this year. So we also have several new accounts but their contributions at this point probably not so critically as we hope that as becomes visible in the next quarter results. 
Moshe Katri: Then this is for Ilya. I guess when you guys went public you spoke about the fact that the company needs to invest in the business. And you did kind of indicate that margins will be down slightly. So I think the general kind of guidance was that for EBIT margins to be similar to mid-teams. Is that a level that we're comfortable at going on an ongoing basis at this point? Just talk a bit about the margin trends. And without talking about next year's numbers but just in general. 
Ilya Cantor: Sure, I think we are within what we consider to be our target operating margin range, so adjusted income from operations this quarter is about 17.4%. I believe we said previously, it was anywhere in, as you said, mid-teens up to upper teens. We also said previously that we would continue to reinvest some of the margin back into the business into initiatives such as expanding our on-site presence and strengthening our competencies and competency centers. We have been doing that. It has been -- we've increased our on-site presence by about 100 basis points from the beginning of the year. It's not exactly where we want to be but we continue to push forward on that initiative and some others. But yes, I mean our target operating margin range is from about mid-teens to upper teens. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Ferguson with Renaissance Capital. 
David Ferguson: Just 2 questions, please. Firstly, on the full year guidance. Are you still working on the assumption that sort of the FX impact will be sort negative of around -- I think you said $3 million? So that's the first question. Or what do you see as the sort of constant currency guidance for this year? And then secondly, again looking into next year without going too specific into the numbers, maybe you can just give us a sense of sort of the conversations that you're having with clients at the moment? Would you say things are sort of more buoyant or less buoyant than at this point 12 months ago? 
Ilya Cantor: I'll take the first question, Ark will take the second question. On the currency question. Last quarter, we said that Q3 and Q4 would be negatively impacted by currency to a tune of around $3 million provided that rates stay where they were. The euro-pound-ruble in particular came back, as you guys know, from that time. So the currency -- the negative currency impact on Q3 and Q4 was not as great as we thought. And instead of about $1.5 million per quarter, we were impacted by about $1 million per quarter. And obviously, I'm talking about Q3 is an actual and Q4 as an expectation, assuming that rates stay where they are today. As far as income of currency on the margins, again, we're relatively neutral as far as P&L impact of currency on our margins and our bottom line. Really what you see is swings in the topline offset by -- sorry, offset in expenses. So that's about the currency. A little bit more on Q3, compared to last year's Q3 we had a negative impact of about $1.7 million. But compared to prior quarter, Q2 of this year, was a positive impact of about a couple of $100,000. So Ark, I believe the second question is what we're hearing from customers... 
Arkadiy Dobkin: For the next year? 
Ilya Cantor: To the extent that we can talk about that. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: In comparison, if I understand the question correctly, in comparison to what we know in the beginning of the year and what we know right now, I think it was pretty much the communication from the client kind of in line with what is happening during the year. It was some small surprises, negative and positive. But in general, it was pretty consistent. In regards to the 2013, right now, we don't think it's the right time to actually comment. It's the beginning of planning period and probably we'll understand much better the situation kind of in the beginning of the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar: The first question I have was, as I look at the growth of headcount versus the year-over-year growth rate for revenues, you maintained a positive gap in revenue growth over headcount growth for many quarters. How long is that sustainable? I mean obviously there are all kinds of positive implications from that trend, so could you go into some detail on that? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: We do believe that it would be sustainable. The question at what rate was actually the difference between these 2 growth rates. So why it's sustainable? Because as we mentioned, we invest in a lot in specific competencies and vertical expertise. And we're getting in the areas where we hope to get higher rates and eventually better margins. And yes, you can see it a little bit from now, but it's still our investment. We invested in branch, invested in training, invested in a lot of people right now and some on-site -- increasing on-site presence also. But all of this actually is our effort to kind of distance our revenue growth from our headcount growth. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar: In terms of, I guess, the forward or predictive nature of your headcount to revenues, how much -- is that a percentage? You may have given this -- I apologize if I missed it. People that are lateral versus college hires, could you give us that delta or that percentage breakout? As well as, what's the training periods you use and so on? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Well, we have a little bit different strategy in our different labor markets because what we do in Belarus is different from what we do in Ukraine, or what we do in Russia, or what we do in Hungary. In general, I think around 30% [ph] of our people coming from universities. And in this case, they have a pretty significant period of time inside training facilities at EPAM. Sometimes for several months, but sometimes up to 5 to 6 months. So in Belarus, this percentage is higher. In Ukraine, it's lower based on the historical kind of situation when  [indiscernible] was started and what actually is the skills pyramid and skills experience we have. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital. 
Darrin Peller: Could you just give a little more specific color into where you may have been surprised at the upside just given your improvements? I think you mentioned earlier that improvements or better performance across every vertical as part of the reason to drive guidance increase. I think beyond even the beat [ph] from the quarter. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: So you're asking about specific examples of -- or what exactly would you like to... 
Darrin Peller: Looking for specifics on the -- like, which industry verticals? Which -- yes, I mean, I guess examples would be nice as well. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: From what we have said already, clearly Financial services and Retail Consumer is growing very fast. Also, our ISV or product development services expertise allow us to grow as well. So this is 3 main drivers for our area. On specific cases we have several strategic accounts which committed to the relationship with EPAM and it is very predictable kind of the growth. Probably, if you look at our top 10 clients this year, there are 5 of them were growing over 40% and we still have very large opportunity, practically in each of these clients. Only 2 clients were declining significantly like Thomson Reuters and one more around 20% or more. And another 3 clients practically flat, plus, minus 5% or so but we have, like, from top 10, 5 are clients growing very, very fast. We're also increasing the number of clients with over $5 million in revenue. Each of them have a pretty good potential to become even bigger and we have several of them, specifically in Retail and Consumer Services group and ISV & Technology group which have a potential to grow over $10 million. That's during this year or, let's say, during the last 4 quarters, we got about -- over 10 clients with $1 million run rate already today and half of them having potential to become in the next 4 quarters, $10 million in size. 
Ilya Cantor: And I'll add to sort of the -- part of the upside surprise that is causing us to raise guidance. One thing Ark already mentioned earlier, which is what we're seeing as a slight recovery in the financial sector in the former Soviet Union, as well as we were also developing a very good relationship with a very large retailer in Canada, which came about as part of our acquisition of Thoughtcorp earlier this year. And then there was just broad-based strength across, as we said, most of our verticals and we're definitely seeing a lot of indications of budget flush in Q4. 
Darrin Peller: That's interesting because, I mean, it's not exactly -- you're not seeing that across, I would say, broad-based across some of your larger competitors. But that's great to hear. And the type of work, I mean just -- it seems like your software development work as a percentage of overall has gone up a little bit over the past year, not a lot but I guess relatively speaking. Tell us a little bit about the stickiness of this revenue in the sense of how much is a, is this with existing clients that you have basically harvested for more opportunity and just increased in a percentage of your large top 10 or so. You mentioned earlier some that increasing. But more specifically, just want to know how much is actually coming from your existing base and then how much of that do you think can last more than 6-month projects versus longer? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: So I think I was sharing this during the my note that around 89% of our revenue come in from the clients who are with us at least for 12 months, and 76% coming with clients who with us over 2 years. So basically, it's a pretty, pretty strong stickiness in our client base. If you think about software companies, they usually releasing software in pretty stable cycles and it creates a very strong relationship. So there are some clients specifically in several hospitality area where you might get onetime big project and it might be finishing after this. Still we hope that this relationships would be continued but besides this area, most of our client base, it's very long-term and very stable, including our revenue stream. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus. 
David Grossman: Arkadiy, in your prepared remarks you talked about your Digital Marketing business. I'm wondering can you help us understand just how meaningful that business is to you and where the momentum is coming from, whether it be geographic or by vertical? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: So from -- if you think about our key industry focus areas, we talked about ISVs a lot. Financial Services probably the most understandable market in IT outsourcing service. But then if you look at the Business Information & Media, Consumer and Retailer, and Travel and Hospitality, all of the 3 segments is very dependent right now on new type of business models. And most of them are driven by digital strategy and include the Internet mobility and cloud deployment. So I think all of these 3 industries very much demanding these types of skills, and these types of skills usually very new. So that's what we're trying to explain, that we accumulate in the skills probably faster than most of our competitors because we're working with a lot of technology companies and getting kind of early [ph] exposure to these new trends and converting them to the experience, which is very much in demand in this segment. So that's probably kind of explanation of importance and what's driving this. From the point of view of geography, how it's split around, clearly, North America and Western Europe providing a lot of demand. But what's interesting is this experience, which we accumulated in these regions, actually now are driving some success for us in former Soviet Union region. We even didn't mention that together with Financial Services, probably e-commerce type of applications right now is the weakest driver in the region for us and for[indiscernible] as well. 
David Grossman: And how meaningful is this business to you right now, in terms of size? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Well the most of the growth you see in Retail and Consumer coming from this. Big portion of the growth in Business Information & Media also coming from this type of services. 
Ilya Cantor: While you can't use it as a direct proxy, the percent of revenues at Retail and Consumer and Travel and Hospitality together are about 20% of our business. And you could say a lot of that and Business Information & Media is about 14%, right? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Just the proportion of the total business between these 3 segments, it's more like what you mentioned, 40% or 50%. 
David Grossman: 40% to 50% of those verticals. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: And then ISV and Financial Services, each of them around 25%, 26%. The rest is related to this. 
David Grossman: And then I think you mentioned this in perhaps some of the earlier questions, but just if I didn't hear it right, that -- do we have any sense yet whether the Thomson Reuters base is stabilizing at current levels, or whether it'll continue to degrade from what you're, I guess, estimating for the fourth quarter? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: There is no any news we can definitively share right now about the future. We hope that it stabilize. We actually -- as I mentioned during the last couple of quarters when addressing the Thomson Reuters questions, we have some opportunities outside of the area of where we have decreasing business. But at this point, it's too early to say. So at the same time, you saw the announcement that we discussed -- not actually starting some partnership which, again, too early to say where would go but definitely, the relationship is normal. A lot of it depends on the, actually, business of Thomson Reuters itself. That's why it is very difficult to comment right now. We hope that it stabilizes based on the Q4 kind of the size. 
Ilya Cantor: And also, David, just a rough estimate, people that we transferred from or have transferred from Thomson Reuters to other accounts, other new or faster-growing accounts, at higher rates, at full run rate, you would generate about $400,000 to $500,000 in internal revenue per quarter. That's at a full run rate. 
David Grossman: And where are you in that transfer process? Are you 75% done based on current revenue rates for Thomson Reuters? Or how much of that capacity has been absorbed? 
Ilya Cantor: Yes, we're mostly done. 
David Grossman: Was that mostly done in the third quarter? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: At the end of the third quarter, it was mostly done. It's clearly still affected the third quarter results. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Alexander Vengranovich with OTKRITIE Capital. 
Alexander Vengranovich: I have a question regarding your cash on the balance sheet. So you're continuing to accumulate cash. I'm just wondering whether you're actually planning to do some M&A this year or probably have any other ways of using that cash this year going forward? 
Ilya Cantor: Yes, Alexander. So yes, we do have a good amount of cash in the balance sheet. And our balance sheet in general is healthy. And now we are looking at a number of M&A opportunities. We obviously cannot talk about opportunities we're looking at in detail. We are also continuing to invest in facilities as we talked about before, our projected investment in total for the new men's facility is about $18 million to $20 million. Of which we've spent only about half so far. And we're also looking at other facilities in Ukraine, for instance, which would also generate incremental benefits in terms of reductions of overhead and increase in resource brand awareness in the region. So while it may seem like it’s a comfortable cushion, if we continue to execute with our M&A strategy as planned and with our facility expansion, then we are utilizing our capital in line with our expectations. 
Alexander Vengranovich: And in case there is not any further M&A's in the landscape, would you consider changing your dividend policy? 
Ilya Cantor: Dividend policy, no. We do not intend to change our dividend policy in the near future, same as with our peer group. 
Operator: And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, very much. Thank you for taking time to participate in our call today. We appreciate the interest and we're happy to entertain a call for any follow-up questions. So on this, I would like to conclude this call today. Thank you, very much. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q2  (2012-08-03 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to EPAM's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and we have allocated 1 hour for prepared remarks and question and answer. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Richard Zubeck [ph], Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. 
Unknown Executive: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received the copy of the earnings release for the company's second quarter 2012 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, www.epam.com.  The speakers we have on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Ilya Cantor, Chief Financial Officer. 
 Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. 
 I would now like to turn the call over to Arkadiy Dobkin. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you, Richard. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2012 earnings call. I will discuss highlights from our second quarter, discuss our key achievements, as well as discuss specific challenges we are currently faced. After this, I will turn it over to Ilya for a more in-depth review of the second quarter financials. 
 We are pleased to report another strong quarter. Our revenue grew 10% sequentially and nearly 30% year-over-year to $103.8 million. This is an important milestone as this is the first time in our history where we exceeded $100 million in revenues per quarter, and I am particularly happy to see that result. 
 I'm proud of our people and of our accomplishments over the past years that made all this possible. So I want to say thanks to all our people for a job well done. We're also pleased to report a strong earnings growth and margin expansion. Non-GAAP income from operations increased 40% to a record of $19.1 million. And operating margins increased 140 basis points to 18.4% from 17% last year. Finally, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.37 or a 42% increase from last year. 
 During the quarterly close on the acquisition of Thoughtcorp, a Toronto-based IT consultancy and software solution provider. Thoughtcorp had a 17-year history of delivering high-value IT solutions and complex software applications to many of Canada's most recognized companies within telecommunications, financial and retail segments. 
 Thoughtcorp complements our existing global delivery capabilities with its proven expertise in areas important for us, such as Agile Development, Enterprise Mobility and Business Intelligence. And we are excited about the possibility this combination brings. 
 As in the first quarter, we benefited from a growing trend in Europe where in the difficult times, companies are turning to evaluate strategic partners to help drive efficiencies and reduce their cost. 
 Comparing to the second quarter of last year, revenue from clients located in Europe expanded 37%. 
 Within North America, which continues to be our largest market, we also had good traction and increased revenue by 27%, driven by both existing and new accounts. 
 In the CIS regions, revenues increased by 25% due to recognition of $4.3 million in nonrecurring revenue from a large World Bank-sponsored fixed-fee project that was completed this quarter. This revenue has been included within our previous guidance, and we don't expect any such other nonrecurring items during rest of the year. 
 We also saw continuing growth across most of our verticals. ISVs & Technology grew 19%. Shift in software industry drives our clients to demand proven expertise in cutting-edge technologies such as big data, cloud and mobility, as well as related large re-platforming efforts. And we are one of the best positioned product development vendors to benefit from such demands. 
 In this turn, the Retail and Consumer grew 87% as a result of pressure on firms to improve their online customer experience, enable Web 2.0 rich internet applications and support mobile commerce. 
 Banking and Financial Services grew 38%. Customers in this industry continue facing many challenges and looking for higher deployment and reliable vendors to help addressing those challenges. And EPAM proved such value during the last several years and continues to grow with a number of strategic investment banking accounts. Our Business Information and Media vertical was essentially flat year-over-year, mostly due to a continued drop-down at Thomson Reuters. Excluding the impact of this cutback, this vertical would have grown 17%. And in overall, we continue to maintain a very healthy balance of revenues between our indices, geographies and customs.
 From the same quarter last year, we had a number of new wins, which we are particularly excited about. We cannot go into specific names, but EPAM acquired highly strategic accounts in nearly every sector in which we compete. About 20 of new clients are on $1 million plus run rate right now. About 1/2 of those could be considered to have potential of becoming $10 million plus accounts within the next 24 months. 
 We also saw strong growth within our existing accounts with approximately 80% revenues coming from clients that have used our services for at least 2 years. This, again, confirms the high quality of our services and the loyal nature of our customer base. 
 On the surface, we had a net increase of about 1,600 IT professionals over the past year or roughly 26% growth and ended the quarter with 7,750 engineers. And we continue to maintain one of the lowest attrition rates in the industry. 
 Turning to the outlook. There are several key issues. First, Thomson Reuters announced further unexpected forecasts and provided services during the last several years. This impacts our outlook for the second half of the year by approximately $2 million to $3 million. 
 We are dealing the situation by aggressively reallocating the people to a number of other new and existing growing accounts, but this will impact results in any case. 
 Second, currency cost has approximately $1.6 million in Q2 revenue comparing to previous guidance. And if exchange rates stay in current levels, it would cost another $3 million or so comparing to our original full year guidance. 
 Third, based on the conversations we have had with our existing clients, IT budgets appear to be in line with previous year, but decisions time for initiating new projects are extended in some cases. 
 Based on this, we had taken a more conservative stance and revising our full year revenue outlook to be $412 million to $418 million, which represents year-on-year growth of 23% to 25%. 
 On the positive side, we're increasing our earnings growth expectation to be 16% to 18% for the year versus the previous guidance of 11% to 13%. There are several reasons for this, such as continuing focus on cost control, moderate wage inflation and a slight benefit from currency. 
 So to recap. We had another good quarter with solid revenue and earnings growth and margin expansions. We were able to acquire some great new accounts, and we had strong growth from existing accounts. We also continue to recruit and retain smart and talented people. At the same time, we now face some challenges, specifically from further cuts of [ph] Thomson Reuters and headwinds from currency. But fundamentally, our business remains strong, and we continue to execute according to our plan. 
 With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ilya, who will walk you through the financial results. Ilya? 
Ilya Cantor: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. After my comments, we'll open the call for questions. 
 As Ark highlighted, Q2 was another solid quarter where we grew revenues nearly 30% to a record $103.8 million, while expanding margins and maintaining a healthy balance sheet. 
 I'd like to start by providing more details and color around our guidance for the third quarter and the year. And you heard, there are 2 specific issues that came up very recently that impacted the top line outlook. As Arkadiy noted, Thomson Reuters informed us of additional and unexpected cuts in our services. We expect the impact of their decision to be approximately $2 million to $3 million in the second half of the year. This estimate, though, does not include any potential upside from reallocation of those resources to other growing or new projects. In other words, a revised full year guidance assumes 100% hit to utilization, which may or may not be the case over the next several months. 
 Second, a stronger dollar negatively impacted revenues by approximately $1.6 million in Q2 compared to previous guidance. And if exchange rates stay at the current levels, it would cost another $3 million or so compared to our original full year guidance. Remember that this is only top line, and in fact, we benefited in Q2 slightly at the operating margin level from offsetting impact of currency on our expense base. 
 So these are 2 specific issues that caused us to slightly decrease full year revenue guidance. Furthermore, we are raising our earnings growth projections for the year. This is primarily a result of 2 things: one is our continuing focus on cost controls. Our SG&A, excluding stock compensations, declined as a percent revenue by 140 basis points compared to last year to 19.1% of revenues. And two, better than the planned wage inflation. 
 So putting all this together, one, we expect Q3 revenues to be between $107 million and $109 million, representing year-on-year growth of 24% to 26% and sequential growth of 3% to 5%. 
 Two, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.36 per share for Q3 with an expected share count of approximately 45.6 million and a tax rate of approximately 16%. 
 For the full year, we expect revenues to be between $412 million to $418 million, which represents growth of 23% to 25%. 
 On a full year basis, we're raising adjusted earnings growth to be in the range of 16% to 18%, with an assumed tax rate of approximately 16%. 
 So onto the rest of the financials. Starting with revenues from a vertical perspective, ISVs & Technology comprised 24% of revenues, down slightly from 26% last year, which was in line with our expectations. 
 Banking and Financial Services increased to 23% of total revenues from 22% last year. 
 Our Business Information and Media vertical accounted for 15% of revenues compared to 20% last year, reflecting a continued decline of Thomson Reuters as previously mentioned. 
 Travel and Hospitality, 10% versus 12%, same time last year. Retail and Consumer with 12% of revenue compared to 8% last year. And finally, other with 14% of revenue compared to 9% last year, which was driven entirely by a $4.3 million of nonrecurring revenue related to a large World Bank-sponsored project mentioned earlier by Ark.
 We reported an increase in revenues from our top 10 clients of $12 million as we continue to grow the size of our key business accounts. Our top 5 and top 10 clients accounted for 32% and 47% of total revenue for the quarter compared to 35% and 48% in the preceding quarter, respectively, so a slight decline. 
 We continue to generate a substantial portion of our revenues from our existing client base, with approximately 80% of revenues generated by customers who have been with us for at least 2 years. 
 Time and material contract decreased as a percent of revenue with 85% in the second of quarter of 2012 versus 87% in the second quarter of 2011. Fixed-fee revenues represent 13% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2012 versus 10% in the second quarter of 2011. This shift is, again, a direct result of the previously mentioned fixed-fee project revenue referenced in Q2. 
 Moving aside, our fixed-fee revenues would be roughly 9% of our revenues in the quarter and 88% in time and materials. 
 Turning to our cost. Cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, in the second quarter was $63.8 million, representing an increase of 30.7% from $48.8 million in the second quarter of 2011.
 This increase was primarily due to a net increase of 26% in IT professional headcount. 
 SG&A in the second quarter was 20% of revenues, down from 21% in the second quarter of 2011. Depreciation, amortization expense was $2.4 million, a slight increase from $2 million reported in the second quarter of 2011. 
 GAAP income from operations in the second quarter of 2012 was $16.8 million, an increase of 55% over the second quarter of 2011. Operating margins were 16.2% for the second quarter compared to 13.6% for the same quarter last year. 
 The improvement in operating margins is due largely to the nonrecurring goodwill impairment charge taken in the second quarter of 2011, as well as lower professional fees and continuing leverage of our overhead costs. 
 Non-GAAP income from operations in the second quarter of 2012 was $19.1 million, an increase of 40% over the second quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP operating margins were 18.4% for the second quarter compared to 17% the same quarter last year. Net income for the quarter was $13.3 million, which is a year-over-year increase of 61%. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $16.9 million or a diluted earnings per share of $0.37. This represents 42.3% increase compared to the second quarter of 2011. Our non-GAAP diluted share count used for the second quarter of 2012 was 46.4 million. 
 Turning to our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had $104.9 million in cash. During the quarter, net cash provided by operations was $6.4 million compared to $10.4 million of net cash provided by operations in the second quarter of 2011. Year-to-date cash provided by operations was $1.6 million compared to $10.8 million last year. 
 So in conclusion, our business is fundamentally sound, our pipeline is healthy and we're continuing to execute according to our plan. 
 We will now open the call for a question-and-answer session. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen and Company. 
Moshe Katri: Arkadiy, you spoke about long sale cycles or decision sale cycles. Can you kind of elaborate a bit more on that? Are we seeing this in a specific region or vertical? Are we being just conservative? And then, are we seeing any delays or cancellation in that respect? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: I wouldn't say that it's like all -- across all regions or all our line segments, more related to our relatively small business in AES region today and probably 1 or 2 accounts. So again, we see this, and exactly like we have mentioned, it's in some specific cases, but building and see it as a company turn. 
Moshe Katri: Okay, that's fair. And then just a follow-up, Thomson Reuters. Can you just remind us how many people are kind of deployed at this account right now? How quickly can you redeploy them without incurring the incremental utilization rate hit? And then maybe kind of give us some more details on what happened at Reuters in the past few weeks, as you said. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: We have around 500 people deployed today. Well, as we mentioned, it would -- with another notification judged during the last couple of weeks, which was in addition to what kind of carefully planned level of ramp down, which we discussed on previous calls. We don't know about specific reasons why it was done. At the same time, we're already starting to redeploy this. We have several really fast-growing accounts with similar skills, and we started the redeployment process very, very aggressively right now. Well, it does seem that in several months, we will be able to utilize these people because it's a very experienced team and was working together for a long time. So it's kind of creating additional opportunities for us. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Yes, my first question is also on Thomson Reuters. The -- just a clarification, the 100% hit to utilization, I'm assuming it's for both revenues and profit that you assumed in your numbers. And as you redeploy these people, would they be at higher billing rates, given what we know about Thomson Reuters' lower rate? 
Ilya Cantor: The answer to your question is yes to both. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay. And then -- that was quick. And then on Russia, if you could update us on the situation there. It was one of the sources of weakness, particularly in financial services last time. How is that tending? 
Ilya Cantor: So as far as Russia is concerned, specifically, the region is not growing. We -- in the CIS region, as we mentioned, we had a onetime nonrecurring revenue recognition item of $4.3 million, which showed growth for the region but -- of $3.1 million or 25% or so. But if you strip that out, it would be in a slight decline. We don't particularly see sort of additional volatility to this extent from here on out. But we also don't count on growth from that region either. And this is, as we've talked about in the past, by design. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar: This is not a focus where you draw different -- sort of draw down these revenues over time. 
Ilya Cantor: Yes. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. 
Darrin Peller: Can you just, first of all, comment on the pipeline of what you're seeing, where you're seeing it from, what kind of business? A little more detail and color will be helpful in terms of new pipeline, new bookings, maybe geographically, as well as type of business from a discretionary, and how long the contracts are now. I mean, I know when you guys first went public on... 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes. Within -- there's a good traction right now in Europe and North America. Both of them growing, and we've had some exceptions like we've mentioned already. Between specific industries, I would say that we have very good opportunities in ISV sector in United States. We also continue to grow way too fast in the financial services in Europe. One of the fastest growing area is Retail and Consumer and Travel and Hospitality for us. So that it's the fastest-growing sector and it's all related to demand through new online experience, commerce-related applications. So -- and we've seen a lot of opportunities around this area, and we actually are very aggressively building up our focus competencies and solution practices specifically in this area. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Alexander Vengranovich with OTKRITIE Capital. 
Alexander Vengranovich: I have a question regarding your potential cost-cutting measures -- cost control measures, which you are planning and already started as far as I understand. As it's implemented in the company, it should result in an increase in net income. Could you please elaborate on this? 
Ilya Cantor: Yes. We didn't say we were starting a cost-cutting program. We said we were raising earnings growth guidance because we continued to maintain a really sharp focus on cost controls, as we've always done. And this has been slightly ahead of expectations. That's one of the reasons for raising the earnings growth target. But we are in really good shape. We don't feel we need to sort of have a comprehensive cost-cutting program. It's just business as usual. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: That's the normal result of our -- we're still growing with this. We're growing in revenue, we're growing in headcount and clearly, billable headcount, and it's clearly a portion of G&A going down. That's what we specifically mentioned. 
Alexander Vengranovich: Okay. And second question. Could you please update us on your M&A plans for this year? Are you still planning to continue M&A activity? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: I don't think we can give you any specifics. You saw that we completed our first acquisition for this year in Q2. And we had some -- had opportunities in our pipeline, but I don't think we can give you any specific answer right now. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. 
Darrin Peller: I just wanted to follow up with a different question also. Around the expense side, obviously, there's been margin improvement going on. Can you just give us a little more color on what we should be expecting in terms of sustainability of that and --  maybe little more specifics, or specificity on what exactly you're doing to really bring out cost in the model and what can go on? 
Ilya Cantor: We did have really good margin expansion in this quarter. Part of that was driven by also the onetime revenue recognition item, right? So kind of full disclosure. So we don't expect sort of aggressive expansion of margins like we saw in Q2, in Q3 and Q4, particularly, since our sequential growth we're projecting right now, at least in the model, to be kind of 3% to 5% in Q3 and flattish in Q4 to Q3. So I would moderate sort of expectations about margin expansion from here. As far as your question with regards to taking cost out of the model, again, just like -- I take, though, you dropped off when we were answering a similar question to Alexander. We don't have a comprehensive cost-cutting program going on, it's just business as usual where we always keep a sharp focus on cost. Our SG&A continues to drive leverage into the model. We did see slightly better wage inflation results and we've moderated those expectations for the year as well so that helped. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of David  Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus. 
David Grossman: Ilya, could you just review, perhaps, the flow of FX down the P&L in terms of revenue and margin? Obviously, we can see the benefit in terms of a gain or loss from FX, but perhaps you can run us through the impact above that. 
Ilya Cantor: Okay. So as we mentioned, compared to where we were in Q1, Q2 was negatively impacted on a top line basis by about $1.5 million, $1.6 million. And this came primarily from the euro and ruble. I think pound actually strengthened a little bit. Net-net, it actually gave us a slight benefit in the bottom line, but nothing sort of material to speak of. But if -- again, if we're extending this trend forward, and we're just doing sort of simple dumb math, $1.5 million in Q3, $1.5 million in Q4, would cause another $3 million in top line headwinds. So this is what we're projecting right now. Again, our currency mix is such that we're actually neutral in the bottom line, and this is what we saw in Q2. We don't expect the situation to change materially from there. Hopefully, that answers your question. 
David Grossman: When you say neutral to the bottom line, is that including the foreign exchange loss or excluding that? 
Ilya Cantor: This is excluding the foreign exchange loss, which, on the P&L right now for Q2, really represents a remeasurement of local currency, monetary assets and liabilities to a functional. So that kind of stuff aside, the economic impact to our P&L is neutral and at times even slightly positive. 
David Grossman: Right. So the 1.39 is just balance sheet translation, then? 
Ilya Cantor: Remeasurement, yes. 
David Grossman: And I guess, just going back to your change in outlook. I mean, I think if you take Thomson Reuters as with $2 million to $3 million and then the FX impact of another $3 million that you just outlined, that pretty much accounts for the change for the year. So should we take from that the balance of the installed base at least and the new business activity that you would actually assume for the balance of the year is pretty much consistent with where we were 3 months ago? Or is that too much of a generalization there? 
Ilya Cantor: Well, barring a disaster scenario, yes, it is the answer. We're still in a good place. We still see a healthy pipeline. We still see a good client activity. As Ark mentioned, we had really good results from new client acquisition in the past couple of quarters. So fundamentally, the sort of the tweak to the guidance does relate to those 2 specific issues. And to the extent that we're taking a somewhat conservative approach and not sort of recognizing the benefits of potential reallocation of Thomson Reuters personnel, that's sort of tempered also by the fact that while we don't know what Thomson Reuters is going to do, what we know is what we know right now. We think we've baked in all the bad news, but that's what we said last time. 
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen and Company. 
Moshe Katri: Ilya, I guess, you mentioned the fact that you're expecting wage inflation to moderate. Can you kind of provide some more details on that in terms of where -- what sort of comp increases are baked into the model now versus where -- what sort of increases were baked before? 
Ilya Cantor: I think we mentioned before that we were going to have wage inflation around 10% to 12%. We're now seeing it below 10%. 
Moshe Katri: All right. And is there a way kind of to break it down by the various regions? Or this is kind of across the board? 
Ilya Cantor: This is really across the board. It's really across the board. 
Operator: At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay, thank you. Thank you, Richard. So what we can confirm is that there are some exceptional issues, which we have seen this quarter. In general, business is strong and we have a lot of prospects. And we have most of -- practically, all of our top 10 accounts, except Thomson Reuters, in very good shape and most of them growing pretty fast. So we are very confident in the current situation into the company and have actually various opportunities for the future. So -- and I think we're internally considering the situation with Thomson Reuters as a good opportunity as well. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude EPAM's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-05-08 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to EPAM's Fiscal First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded, and we have allocated an hour for prepared remarks and Q&A. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Jeff Grossman, Investor Relations at EPAM. Please go ahead, sir. 
Unknown Executive: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter 2012 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, www.epam.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Ilya Cantor, Chief Financial Officer. 
 Before I begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. 
 I would now like to turn the call over to Arkadiy Dobkin. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2012 earnings call. We are pleased with our performance as we reported quarterly results that were ahead of our expectations, delivering strong growth in Europe and the U.S., as well as in most of our key verticals and primary service areas. 
 During the first quarter, total revenue grew 30% to $94.4 million year-over-year. Adjusted income from operations grew 27% to $16.1 million year-over-year, and we delivered non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.31 per share for the quarter. 
 Our first quarter results were driven by our growing diverse client base where Europe plays a significant role. Compared to the first quarter of last year, revenue from clients located in Europe expanded 62%. As we have pointed out before, the European landscape has changed over the last few years and has opened up for high-quality services delivery in nearshoring or offshoring modes. We have certainly benefited from this trend and expect that it will continue in 2012. 
 Within North America, which represents our largest market, we also have good traction and increased revenue by 26%, driven by both existing and new clients. 
 In the CIS region, revenue declined by 12% or $1.5 million due to timing of delivery of certain fixed-fee projects and some pressure on financial services clients in the region. 
 Similar to last quarter, we saw strong growth from all our primary services lines. Software development revenue increased 31% to $63 million, application testing services increased 32% to $19 million and application, maintenance and support revenues increased 24% to $8 million. 
 We saw continued growth across most of our verticals. Retail and consumer, which grew 112% as a result of increased demand for our strong expertise in the commerce and SAP technology solutions; travel and hospitality, which grew 50% as a result of several new clients and our ability to leverage our extensive content management and portal solutions, e-commerce, business intelligence and mobility expertise; banking and financial services, which grew 38% as a result of continuing penetration of strategic accounts within the investment banking industry; and ISV or independent software vendors and technology grew 21% in line with our intention to have significant portion of our business within that segment to continually improve our software engineering skills and understanding of the emerging technology trends based on real-life, hands-on experience serving the best technology companies in the world. 
 We believe that during this quarter, we have captured additional market share across those verticals. Revenue growth in our Business Information & Media vertical was up only 2% year-over-year, mostly due to completion of the number of large projects for Thomson Reuters, as well as the Thomson decision to use their own internal resources for starting [ph] new projects. This decision was expected, and although the overall revenue is currently declining, our relationship with Thomson Reuters remains strong. We continue to see additional growth opportunities throughout the organization, and a number of new potential projects are becoming visible. 
 As in the past, we saw strong growth within existing clients with average of 81% and 65% of our revenues during the first quarter of 2012, coming from the clients that have used our services for at least 2 and 3 years, respectively. This confirms the high quality of our services and the loyal nature of our customer base. In addition, we added a number of key new clients during this quarter. 
 Revenues from our top 10 clients increased $12 million in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the first quarter of 2011. This represented 42.5% of the increase in revenue in the first quarter of 2012. Overall, we believe we have a high growth potential over the next few years with most of our top accounts. 
 In regards to our delivery capacity, as I indicated last quarter, one of our main near-term priorities is to invest more in our core existing competencies across both technology platforms and industry segments. We have to identify and hire new talent with such skills in order to expand our strategic vertical segments further. During Q1, we increased the number of such professionals in both U.S. and Europe. 
 We also need to increase scale across our delivery centers. Through our close relationships with universities in Central and Eastern Europe, we are able to identify and attract the top new talent without materially impacting utilization or attrition rates. 
 Relative to the first quarter of 2011, we had a net increase of 1,580 professionals over the past year and ended the quarter with approximately 7,300 engineers, with one of the lowest attrition rates in the industry. We remain on track to expand our headcount by 20%, 22% this year. We also will continue to identify and evaluate potential acquisitions to expand our geographic footprint and compliment our global delivery capabilities. 
 As we move through 2012, we are paying close attention to the broader macroeconomic trends and general levels of IT spend. Thus far, we believe that budgets are in line with previous years. However, as you know, there is volatility in the overall macroeconomic environment and in the competitive landscape. So for the full year 2012, we are maintaining our guidance for revenue and earnings growth. 
 With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ilya, who will walk you through the financials. Ilya? 
Ilya Cantor: Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. After my comments, we will open the call to questions. As detailed in our press release, we had another solid quarter, growing revenues 30% to $94.4 million, while maintaining stable margins and a healthy balance sheet. 
 Starting with the revenues from a vertical perspective, ISVs & Technology comprised 26% of revenues, down slightly from 27% last year, which was in line with our expectations. As we've stated in the past, we intend to maintain a substantial part of our business with ISV and tech clients as they are a part of the foundation of EPAM, and these relationships provide us the necessary means to stay in front of the general and emerging technology trends. 
 Banking & Financial Services increased to 24% of total revenues from 22% last year as we continue to benefit from the growing trend of outsourcing by  financial institutions. Our Business Information & Media vertical accounted for 16% of revenues compared to 21% last year; Travel and Hospitality, 12% versus 11% same time last year; and Retail and Consumer was 13% of revenues compared to 8% last year. 
 Our vertical growth was led by Retail and Consumer and Banking & Financial Services, which grew 112% and 38%, respectively. As Ark mentioned, we reported an increase in revenues from our top 10 clients of $12 million as we continued to grow the size of our key existing accounts. Our top 5 and top 10 clients accounted for 35% and 48% of total revenues in the quarter. Time and material contracts continued to increase as a percent of revenues, with 89% versus 87% same time last year. Fixed-fee contracts represented 9% of total revenues this quarter versus 11% in the first quarter of 2011. 
 Turning to our costs. Cost of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization in the first quarter, was $60.2 million, representing an increase of 32.2% from $45.5 million in the first quarter of 2011. This increase was primarily due to a net increase of 1,500 IT professionals to support the growth and demand for our services. 
 SG&A in the first quarter was 18.7% of revenues, down from 18.9% in the first quarter of 2011. Depreciation and amortization expense was $2.2 million, a slight increase from the $1.8 million reported in the same quarter of last year. 
 GAAP income from operations in the first quarter of 2012  was $13.8 million, an increase of 17% over the first quarter of 2011. Operating margins were 14.6% for the first quarter compared to 16.3% same quarter last year. The decline in margins were primarily driven by stock compensation and certain nonrecurring charges. 
 Non-GAAP income from operations in the first quarter of 2012 was $16.1 million, an increase of 27% over the first quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP operating margins were 17.1% for the first quarter compared to 17.5% in the same quarter last year. 
 Interest income was $0.5 million, and we also reported a small net foreign exchange gain of less than $100,000 for the quarter. Net income for the quarter was $12.1 million, which is a year-over-year increase of 24%. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $14.4 million or a diluted EPS of $0.31 per share. This represents a 29.2% increase compared to the first quarter of 2011. 
 Our non-GAAP diluted share count used for the first quarter of 2012 was 46 million shares computed as if -- converted method as though the initial public offering had occurred as of the beginning of the quarter. 
 Turning to our balance sheet. As of March 31, we had $112.7 million cash. Accounts receivable decreased to $54.2 million from $59.5 million at the end of 2011. We finished the quarter with a DSO of 53 days compared to 52 days in the first quarter of last year. Deferred revenues were $5.5 million, a sequential decline from $6.9 million. Unbilled receivables were approximately $42 million compared to $24.5 million at the end of 2011. 
 During the quarter, net cash used in operations was $4.7 million compared to $0.4 million of net cash provided by operations in the first quarter of 2011. The cash used in operations for the quarter was primarily due to higher bonus payments relating to 2011 performance, as well as normal seasonal slowdown in billings with some of our larger clients during the quarter. 
 Finally, I would like to provide you guidance for our second quarter and update our full year 2012 expectations. We expect Q2 revenues of between $100 million and $102 million, representing year-on-year growth of 25% to 27%. We expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.30 to $0.32 per share for Q2, with an expected share count of approximately 46.3 million and a tax rate of roughly 17%. 
 For the full year, we continue to expect revenues between $411 million to $418 million, which represents growth between 23% to 25% over 2011 results. On a full-year basis, we expect earnings growth on a non-GAAP basis to be in the range of 10% to 12%, with a tax rate of approximately 17%. 
 We will now open the call for a question-and-answer session. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen. 
Moshe Katri: So you had -- you've exceeded expectations, raised guidance for Q2 and then you maintain your guidance for the year. I just want to confirm what you're kind of saying during the call that we're doing this just because we're trying to be conservative. Am I correct here? 
Ilya Cantor: Moshe, this is Ilya. Look, we have pretty good visibility into Q2, but as you know, there's also a challenging market environment and a competitive landscape. We have less visibility into the second half of the year than we do into Q2. So we're comfortable with $411 million to $418 million in revenues. So, I mean, there's a little bit of a degree of conservatism, but truly, we don't want to be out ahead of the market right now. 
Moshe Katri: Understood. And then Arkadiy, you said something in your opening remarks about weakness in financial services. Maybe you can kind of repeat what you said. I kind of missed it. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: No, I was referring to financial services in CIS region, not in general. So this is related only to our portion of business in former Soviet Union. 
Moshe Katri: Okay, great. And then can you just repeat some of the revenue metrics by, I think, by the service lines in terms of the growth rates? I think you went through it kind of quickly. 
Ilya Cantor: Sure. Okay. Starting with software development in the first quarter, grew 31% compared to the same quarter last year; testing, 32% growth; maintenance and support, 24% growth; infrastructure services, 33.7%, and those are the main components. 
Moshe Katri: Okay, great. And lastly, Thompson Reuters is roughly 9% of revenues for the quarter? 
Ilya Cantor: Roughly. A little bit less than. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citibank. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar: I guess my first question is, as you roll out some of these verticals and they get the scale, especially with application development and services like that, are you finding a need for different or higher level of training? Or, I mean, do the new people have to be trained differently as you hire them? Can you comment a little bit on that? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: We're definitely, as we mentioned before, planning to bring different caliber of people specifically for developing our competency or expanding our competencies and to perform kind of different roles on-site in client-facing situations. And for this, there are special training efforts we're putting together. It's the same as the special recruitment efforts as well. In general, the services which we provide in line with what we were doing before, so training was in our focus for a long time. It's not something really new effort which we're establishing right now. So again, but for some special roles, there is a difference and we are paying attention to this. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Okay. And one question on client ramps, which, I think, a few of your competitors have had potential issues with in the last few months. The clients that you signed already, as you ramp those clients, are you finding any hesitancy on their part or are they pretty much proceeding as planned in terms of those bookings rolling into revenues? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Okay. First of all, I would like to kind of point out that it's difficult to compare the business and type of clients we have with some of the very large outsourcing firms which you're referring to, okay? So it's probably not exactly apple-to-apple comparisons in behavior of the clients. At the same time, there are some changes, but I don't think it's something unusual happening. I think it's pretty much in line with normal business when some clients expect some level of ramp-up and then change it or some of them ramping up actually faster than they expected as well. So we have seen both directions right now. We've seen some people were trying to stay flat and then changing plans to increase the team very, very quickly. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar: Sure. No, that's fair. I was asking on an average level. On an average level, not so changed. So that's really... 
Arkadiy Dobkin: On average, we feel that it's very similar to previous periods right now, at least in our type of clients, okay? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. 
Darrin Peller: Just one question first. On hiring plans, during the IPO process, I know you mentioned you were planning on making more investments in certain personnel, especially around SAP work and other kinds of work to build out. Is that laying out as -- playing out as expected? Are clients doing more business with EPAM in those areas, beyond the traditional areas that you've worked on in the past? Maybe just start there. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: During the IPO and after this, we were pointing out that some competencies which we developed -- SAP just one of them -- were very critical for us to enter our relationships with accounts. Because again, with our size and with our kind of profile of the company, we're opening doors differently than very large, 10x bigger than us providers. So -- and this has actually worked for us, and we increased the number of people who capable, present our special skills in these areas of competencies. So this is happening according to our plans right now. 
Darrin Peller: Good. And then would you say that your hiring plans overall are continuing to run at the same rate relative to the revenue growth you had expected when you first had the IPO also? Has anything changed on the overall big picture hiring plans? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: No, based on what we see right now, it's exactly in line with our projections. 
Darrin Peller: Okay. And then just last question for me. On your guidance, you've obviously -- you've done well in the first quarter out of the gate. You've maintained guidance right now. I mean, can you give us a sense of your confidence? If you're not changing the guidance, can you just give us a sense in your confidence level around it? I mean, given the environment, obviously, there's clearly some questions as was brought up earlier on the macro and some of your competitors. I know it's not easy to compare. But can you give us a little color on your confidence in your guidance? Maybe it would go a long way. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, I'll let Ilya to start answering and then I'll add what I think. 
Ilya Cantor: Darrin, yes, again, we have very good visibility into Q2. We have less visibility into Q3 and Q4 as we do in Q2, but the visibility is not outside of what we normally have at this point in time. What gives us a little bit of pause is, again, as you mentioned, the macroeconomic environment, some of the things the peers were saying. However, we are fairly confident in getting to $411 million to $418 million revenues. We're much less so confident in hitting numbers beyond that range at this time, but certainly, we will have more information for you at our next earnings call. 
Darrin Peller: Okay. Maybe just -- go ahead, Ark. Were you going to say something? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Again, I would point it out the difference between like -- clearly, very carefully, listened yesterday to the Cognizant call, for example. And again, our client base is different and you understand this. So predictability like our power [ph] agreements is also a little bit different. We're getting to the clients with tens of millions, but the number of these clients are relatively small yet. And basically, the plans which they're sharing with us is also limited, I mean, if it's talking about clients between $1 million and $5 million, for example. So that's why kind of to understand the Ilya answer, we're very well and very comfortable with our Q2, but we don't have enough visibility in Q3 or Q4 to go beyond what we're projecting right now. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus. 
David Grossman: Ark, could you maybe just share with us a little more on the new client activity in the quarter? And I may have missed it, I'm sorry if I did. Just how many new clients you signed and if you could give us a sense for the size of those clients, as well as what your pipeline looks like now versus what it looked like 3 months ago or I guess maybe a couple of months ago. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Well, in general, pipeline, again, we're exactly in line with our guidance for revenue, $411 million, $418 million. So basically, the probability is increasing for Q3 and Q4. And based on the new clients like in Q1, we increased number of clients probably by a dozen. But if you're talking about clients, which we're considering can bring within next 12 months significant revenue, we think we have around 5 clients of this size. And also, kind of coming a little bit back, we were talking or sharing some information about new clients in the past, and these clients are actually growing nicely with us. And we have a number of clients which are coming from $1 million range to $5 million range and from $5 million range to $10 million range. This is happening. So we're kind of increasing a number of large clients in our portfolio right now. 
David Grossman: Okay. And I guess just getting back to some of the earlier comment about kind of the tone from your existing customers, and I think I appreciate your scale relative to some of the others that have reported issues. But that said, it sounds like the ramp within your installed base of clients is pretty consistent with what your expectations were and the ramp that you were seeing 3 months ago. Is that a fair comment? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: That's true. That's a fair comment. That's exactly what we'd like you to understand. 
David Grossman: And then in terms of just looking at the competitive landscape, I've seen some activities from some of the larger players in the region. Is there any real change there or is it pretty much what it's been historically? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: We believe it's very much in line with historical situation. When you're saying locally, you mean exactly competition for revenue in our regions or competition for resources or... 
David Grossman: For resources, ramping headcount. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Again, it's not easy, as we mentioned many times before, but it's pretty much in line with what we expected so far. 
David Grossman: Yes, I'm sorry, maybe you mentioned this, but what is your expectation or your updated expectation for wage increases this year? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: So like what we were communicating before was around 12%, and this is approximately what we expect, maybe a little bit lower. But we will see much better closer to the mid of the year. 
David Grossman: Okay. And any update in terms of expanding the capacity in Minsk? Is that pretty much on track? 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Expanding capacity in Minsk? 
Ilya Cantor: You mean the Minsk building? 
David Grossman: Yes, exactly. 
Arkadiy Dobkin: Yes, it's in construction right now. Yes, under construction. 
David Grossman: Okay. All right. And then maybe just a couple of quick questions for you, Ilya. In terms of the balance sheet, if I'm looking at this right, it looks like you had a pretty big increase in unbilled receivables. Is that just maybe 1 or 2 particular contracts in timing or is there difference in terms of the amount of percentage of completion underway or is it something else that drove that up sequentially? 
Ilya Cantor: Right. So Q1 is -- seasonally sees a buildup in unbilled revenues as paperwork gets completed, as purchase orders get finalized. So this is not an unusual trend. We did have a little bit more in terms of unbilled receivables specific to a top-5 account, which has been resolved at this time. So this is definitely not anything out of the ordinary, and as the business gets bigger, the unbilled receivables get bigger as well. 
David Grossman: And should we expect that to be down then sequentially in the June quarter? 
Ilya Cantor: Absolutely. 
David Grossman: Okay. And in terms of the pro forma adjustments, I'm sure the stock comp number went up with the stock price, but is -- can you help us perhaps with a sense of where those pro forma adjustments are, how we should be modeling those pro forma adjustments for the year now, both stock comp and intangibles? And perhaps you could share with us what the onetime charges were in the quarter. 
Ilya Cantor: Yes. Okay. So in the first quarter, we had one stock compensation charge relevant to a restricted stock grant given to a named executive officer. That will not recur, but it's pushing out stock comp in the first quarter by about $700,000. Also in the first quarter, we had initiated our long-term equity incentive plan with an initial set of grants to a fairly deep swath of our senior managers, call it about 300 to 400 people. That didn't impact Q1 that much because it was granted late in March, but it will continue to impact the outer quarters. So that said, stock comp would be around or was around $1.5 million in the first quarter because of the combination of sort of the stuff that's coming forward from last year, plus the one-off grant to Section 16. But the outer quarters will look about the same, about $1.5 million, $1.6 million, because they will have the impact of the initiation of the long-term equity incentive plan, so also about $1.6 million across the year. 
David Grossman: Okay. And the onetime items in the quarter? 
Ilya Cantor: So the other item of significance that's a onetime item is about a $600,000 -- around about a $600,000 charge that shows up in other expenses. That's related to purchase accounting relevant to an acquisition we did in 2010 that had a trigger on requiring us to issue 53,000 shares of stock once we go public. Obviously, we went public so we issued that stock, so we took that charge. And that's a nonrecurring charge. 
David Grossman: I see. And then the amortization of intangibles should stay at the level we're at in the first quarter as well? 
Ilya Cantor: Yes, it's about $150 million, $160 million. That will be consistent unless, of course, we make an acquisition. 
David Grossman: Right. And then I didn't catch the actual headcount number, the billable headcount number. Do you mind repeating that real quickly, where you were at the end of March? 
Ilya Cantor: Sure. 7,300. 
Operator: And with that, I would like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks. 
Ilya Cantor: Thank you, everyone, and have a good day. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. You may now disconnect.
