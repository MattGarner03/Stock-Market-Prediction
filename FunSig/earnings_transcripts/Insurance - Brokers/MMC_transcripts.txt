===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-17 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh McLennan's Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. First quarter 2025 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most recently comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions] I’ll now turn this over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.
John Doyle: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. On the call with me is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Pat Tomlinson of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Jay Gelb, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh McLennan had a solid start to 2025. As we said coming into the year, results in Q1 faced headwinds due to several factors and our performance tracked well with our expectations. Overall, we grew revenue 9% in the quarter, reflecting continued momentum in underlying revenue growth and contributions from an active year of acquisitions in 2024. Underlying revenue grew 4% despite lower fiduciary interest income and a tough comparison to a strong Q1 last year, and we saw good growth in all four of our businesses. Adjusted operating income increased 8% from a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin declined 20 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2024, reflecting seasonality at McGriff, and adjusted EPS grew 5%. Turning to the macro picture, clearly the global economic outlook has become more uncertain since the start of the year. Ongoing trade negotiations will continue to create challenges for businesses and this has led to reduced consumer and business confidence, as well as financial market volatility. The outlook is likely to remain uncertain as stakeholders continue to assess the potential impacts on global trade and businesses pause new investments. As a result, expectations for GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, and other factors have become less predictable. As far as the insurance industry is concerned, tariffs would likely be inflationary to the overall cost of risk. This comes on top of the increasing frequency and severity of natural catastrophes and rising social inflation costs. We continue to support our clients by leveraging our expertise and solutions as they navigate challenges and make decisions in this period of extreme uncertainty. In fact, we've been advising clients for years on risks to their global supply chains, which now includes disruptions in trade policy. [Centrisk] (ph), our AI-powered supply chain platform, which we've highlighted in past calls, is a good example of our work to assess clients' vulnerabilities to ongoing trade negotiations. In addition, through webinars and thought leadership, accessed by thousands of clients, we are helping them understand the complexity of the moment. In times like these, our clients find value in Marsh McLennan’s unique perspectives, talent and capabilities across risk, strategy, and people. And while we are not immune to shocks in the macro economy, we are well positioned to navigate these environments. Our track record of performance across economic cycles is a result of the strength of our business and the consistent demand for our advice and solutions. I would like to share some thoughts on resilience and preparedness for natural disasters and the role of insurance. The earthquake that struck Myanmar and Thailand is just the latest tragic reminder that we live in a time of heightened exposures to catastrophes. This tragedy, along with the California wildfires and recent flooding in the US, highlights the devastating human toll and economic impact caused by natural disasters, especially taking into consideration the significant proportion of losses that are typically uninsured. These events show the urgent need for resilience and risk mitigation planning in disaster-prone areas. Enhancing risk mitigation is essential for sustainable development and reducing the devastating impact of these events on individuals, businesses, and economies. In catastrophe-prone areas, we must invest in ways that strengthen our infrastructure and lessen the impact of future disasters. To put this into perspective, a recent report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce shows that every dollar spent on resilience saves communities $13 in damages, cleanup costs, and economic impact. U.S. homeowners are increasingly reliant on state-sponsored insurers of last resort in catastrophe-prone areas. In these circumstances, pricing that accurately reflects the true cost of risk can often be compromised in favor of making insurance more available and affordable. Governments and regulators can help by prioritizing resilience and creating the right economic incentives to mitigate losses and foster sustainable improvements in insurance markets. Without increased resilience, the human toll will remain high and the cost of risk will continue to be a significant tax on economies, diverting funds from other important societal priorities. Turning to insurance market conditions, according to the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index, rates decreased 3% in the first quarter despite an elevated risk landscape. This follows a 2% decline in the fourth quarter of 2024. As a reminder, our index skews to large account business. Overall, rates in the US decreased 1%. Latin America was down low single digits. Europe, UK, and Asia were down low to mid-single digits. And Pacific was down high single digits. Global property rates decreased 6% year-over-year, following a 3% decline last quarter. Global casualty rates increased 4%, with US excess casualty up approximately 16% in the quarter. Workers' compensation decreased mid-single digits. Global financial and professional liability rates were down 6%, while cyber also decreased by 6%. In reinsurance, despite the California wildfire losses, capacity remains more than sufficient to support compliant demand, including additional limits in loss-impacted programs. Throughout the first quarter, market conditions were consistent with what we saw at January 1st. Strong reinsurer profitability, high ROEs, and increased capital levels have resulted in ample supply of property cat capacity and rate reductions. It was also a record quarter for cat bond issuance. U.S. property cat reinsurance rates remain competitive for the April 1 renewal period. Non-loss impacted rates were down 5% to 15%, while loss impacted programs typically experienced 10% to 20% rate increases. In U.S. casualty reinsurance, we continue to see a range of outcomes depending on loss experience, with primary carriers demonstrating limit, rate, and underwriting discipline. In Japan, April 1 property cat rates overall were down 10% to 15% on a risk-adjusted basis. Early signs for the June 1 Florida cat risk renewals point to similar market conditions seen in January and April, with an anticipated increase in demand ready to be absorbed by more than adequate supply. As always, our focus is on helping clients navigate these dynamic market conditions. Now let me provide a brief update on our acquisition of McGriff, which closed on November 15th of last year. Our colleagues at McGriff performed well in the quarter, and the integration remains on track. The team is quickly leveraging the broader capabilities of our company while bringing their own distinct advantages to the market. We are already seeing wins from bringing together the best of both. As we said when we announced the transaction, McGriff is a business with outstanding talent and a track record of strong growth, and I'm excited to have them as part of our firm. Now let me turn to our first quarter financial performance and outlook, which Mark will cover in more detail. Revenue grew 4% on an underlying basis, with 4% growth in RIS and 4% in consulting. Marsh was up 5%. Guy Carpenter grew 5%. Mercer 4%. and Oliver Wyman was up 4%. We had adjusted operating income growth of 8% and we generated adjusted EPS in the quarter of $3.06, which was up 5% from a year ago. We also repurchased $300 million of stock in the quarter. Turning to our outlook for 2025, we continue to expect mid-single digit underlying revenue growth, another year of margin expansion, and solid adjusted EPS growth. Of course, this outlook is based on conditions today, and the economic backdrop could turn out to be materially different than our assumptions. In particular, and as discussed earlier, the uncertainty in ongoing trade negotiations and their effect on consumer and business confidence could have a significant impact on the global economy and our results. In summary, we are pleased with our results and are off to a good start in 2025. We are well positioned and have a resilient business that provides critically important advice and solutions and we have proven our ability to deliver across cycles. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, John. And good morning. Our first quarter results represented a solid start to the year. Consolidated revenue increased 9% in the first quarter to $7.1 billion with underlying growth of 4%. Operating income was $2 billion. And adjusted operating income was $2.2 billion, up 8%. Our adjusted operating margin was 31.8%. GAAP EPS was $2.79 and adjusted EPS was $3.06, up 5% over last year. Looking at risk and insurance services, first quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, up 11% or 4% on an underlying basis. Operating income and RIS was $1.6 billion in the first quarter. Adjusted operating income was $1.8 billion, up 8% over last year, and our adjusted margin was 38.2%. Our margin in RIS reflected the impact of seasonality in McGriff's revenue we previously guided to. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $3.5 billion, up 15% from a year ago, or 5% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 8% underlying growth in the first quarter of last year. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 4% for the quarter. In international, underlying growth was 6%. Latin America up 8%, EMEA up 6%, and Asia Pacific up 4%. Guy Carpenter’s revenue in the quarter was $1.2 billion, up 5% on both a GAAP and underlying basis. Growth remained solid despite softer reinsurance market conditions and came on top of 8% growth in the first quarter of last year. In the consulting segment, first quarter revenue was $2.3 billion up 5% or 4% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $456 million and adjusted operating income was $491 million, up 8%. Our adjusted operating margin in consulting was 21.2%, up 50 basis points from a year ago. Mercer's revenue was $1.5 billion in the quarter, up 5%, or 4% on an underlying basis. Health underlying growth was 7%, reflecting continued solid growth across all regions. Wealth was up 3%, led by investment management. Our assets under management were $613 billion at the end of the first quarter, down 1% sequentially and up 25% compared to the first quarter of last year. Year-over-year growth was driven by our acquisition of Cardano, positive net flows, and the impact of capital markets. Career declined 1% reflecting growth in international, offset by continued slower demand in the U.S. Oliver Wyman's revenue in first quarter was $818 million, an increase of 4% on both a GAAP and underlying basis. Growth in the quarter was led by strength in the U.S. and came on top of 13% growth in the first quarter of last year. Fiduciary income was $103 million in the quarter, down $9 million from the fourth quarter, and $19 million compared with the first quarter last year, reflecting lower interest rates. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect fiduciary income will be approximately $100 million. Foreign exchange was a $0.05 headwind in the first quarter. Exchange rates have been volatile over the past several trading days, making it challenging to predict their impact looking forward. However, based on current rates, we anticipate that FX will have an immaterial impact on earnings in the second quarter and the rest of the year. Turning to our McGriff transaction, as John mentioned, our integration continues to go well. As we said last quarter, the first quarter is McGriff's seasonally smallest from a revenue perspective, which resulted in modest dilution to adjusted EPS in the quarter. We continue to expect that McGriff will be modestly accretive to adjusted EPS for full year 2025, becoming more meaningfully accretive in 2026 and beyond. We still expect noteworthy charges associated with McGriff of approximately $450 million to $500 million in total through 2027, with the vast majority of these costs associated with retention incentives, a significant portion of which was put in place by the seller. These costs flowed through our financial statements, but were funded by the seller through a purchase price adjustment. As is our convention, we are excluding McGriff from our underlying growth calculations for the first year. As we mentioned last quarter, we are now excluding acquisition-related intangible amortization and the net benefit credit from our adjusted earnings. Last quarter, we provided a supplement to our press release that recasts historical financial information on this new basis of reporting. Total noteworthy items in the quarter were $91 million, the largest of which was $69 million related to McGriff. Interest expense in the first quarter was $245 million, up from $159 million in the first quarter of 2024. This increase reflects higher levels of debt associated with the McGriff transaction. Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense will be approximately $250 million in the second quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter was 23.1%, which compares with 23.9% in the first quarter last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discrete items, the largest of which was the accounting for share-based compensation, similar to a year ago. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 25.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of between 25% and 26% in 2025. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total debt of $20.5 billion. In the first quarter of 2025, we repaid $500 million of senior notes that matured in March. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in the first quarter of 2026, when $600 million of senior notes mature. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $1.6 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled approximately $800 million and included $405 million for dividends, $95 million for acquisitions, and $300 million for share repurchases. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4.5 billion of capital in 2025 across dividends, acquisitions, and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how our M&A pipeline develops. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter results. For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single digit underlying growth, margin expansion, and solid growth and adjusted EPS. However, as John mentioned, this outlook is based on conditions today, and the economic backdrop, especially in light of recent uncertainty around global trade policies, could turn out to be materially different than our assumptions. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to John.
John Doyle: Thank you, Mark. Andrew, we are ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James.
Q - Gregory Peters: Well, good morning, everyone. Probably very appropriate to go back to the commentary around the tariffs and the trade issues and challenges. Maybe you can provide some additional color on which geographic areas and might it show up inside the risk businesses and does this benefit the consulting business as well as your clients look for more advice?
John Doyle: Yes. Sure, Greg. Look, I think it's difficult to say on a country by country basis what parts of our business might be more impacted. Obviously, there's much more in front of us all in terms of those negotiations. And so, it's quite a fluid situation. At this point anyway, I would say there's no real direct impact to our business. But of course, there'll be indirect impacts. Global GDP may slow at least until there's some resolution. As business confidence declines, we'll see market volatility, of course, in our investment business. That could create some challenges in our OCIO business, but also create some possibilities around the advisory work that we do on behalf of our clients. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, it's likely to be inflationary on loss costs. Again, we'll see how things settle out. It remains to be seen, of course, what it might mean to drug costs in the United States and our employee health and benefits clients here in the US. Obviously, for the global economy, a quicker resolution to these negotiations is important, so businesses and consumers can move forward with greater confidence. But as you mentioned, change is generally good for our consulting businesses. And so, again, we're not immune at all to macro GDP pressure, but we are a resilient business. And again, as we see it now, we continue to expect mid-single digit revenue growth, margin expansion, and solid growth and adjusted EPS. Do you have a follow-up, Greg?
Gregory Peters: Absolutely. My follow-up question, just to pivot back to the capital allocation commentary. One of your peers is also pretty active in the marketplace and encountered some antitrust issues with their pending acquisition. And I know you have a robust record of doing acquisitions in North America and elsewhere. I'm just curious what your view is as you continue to evaluate the landscape of potential opportunities, how that might square or reconcile with growing antitrust potential risks?
John Doyle: Yeah, I'm not familiar with the details, of course, of that particular issue. Obviously, you can check with them. We're very thoughtful and mindful of antitrust risks and have executed very, very effectively. I also think it's pretty unclear where the current administration may come out on our industry and broadly speaking, on M&A. As you point out, for a long time it's been an important value creator for us. We remain quite active in the market. We did four small deals in the first quarter. Our pipeline remains strong. We have a really attractive reputation as a partner in that marketplace. And so, last year, again, was just an outstanding year for us. I talked about McGriff in my prepared remarks, Greg, but I would also note we acquired two other top 100 agencies at MMA last year, Fisher Brown Bottrell and Horton. In addition to that, we acquired Cardano and Vanguard US OCIO business in our investment business. So it was really a terrific year for us in that respect. So we're excited about the possibilities going forward. I'd also note, while we're on this subject, we're more likely to continue what's mostly been a string of pearls type strategy for us. We have the capacity to do something bigger, but we're not just looking to get bigger. We do want to grow, of course, but we want to get better along the way. The businesses that I mentioned make us better, not just bigger. And so, we're really excited and so far so good on all of them. Thank you, Greg. Andrew, next question, please.
Operator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.
Mike Zaremski: Hey thanks, good morning. Maybe going kind of back to the macro backdrop and it makes sense in the prepared remarks, the less predictable and uncertainty, those words were used. I guess when we -- historically when we look at Marsh's revenue growth kind of sensitivity to the macro, the company's done a great job kind of managing its expenses to kind of manage through on the profit margins to make it kind of a more shallow of an impact. I know over the years too that I think you've worked, Marsh's work to make some of its businesses like Career potentially also less macro sensitive. But I'm just kind of curious are you guys adopting a similar playbook right now given the uncertainty to kind of manage your expenses and are using kind of the same playbook as the past or is it tougher now given just the unpredictability of certain factors?
John Doyle: Yes, thanks Mike for the question. Let me talk about the quarter, just -- the first quarter just for a second. As I said, it was a solid start to the year. It was largely in line with what we had expected. We guided to a slower start to the year, right? So we did anticipate slower GDP in the first quarter. Fiduciary income, of course, was going to be under some pressure due to lower interest rates. Mark talked about the impact there. We anticipated a bit softer pricing in the P&C market. And so, all of that factored into our guidance and our expectations around the first quarter. And then, at the same time, last year we just had an outstanding start to the year, and it was our strongest quarter of growth during the year. And so, we expected some macro headwinds and got them, and we had a very tough comp as well. But again, in line with our expectations. Growth overall was good though. It was solid across all of our businesses. On a GAAP basis, very strong again on the strength of some of the acquisitions that I mentioned from a year ago. And I thought we executed well in the quarter. So -- and I've shared our outlook, but yes, we certainly model downside scenarios to revenue, we model upside scenarios too. I think it's important so that we're constantly doing that. So we're being as thoughtful about capital allocation, as thoughtful about expense management, regardless of the environment. Again, whether we have tailwinds or headwinds, we're constantly doing that. It's a critical part of our management playbook. In downside scenarios, yes, we have levers to pull and we know what they are and we spent a fair amount of time talking about them. And so, if things like incentive and sales comp that are naturally going to fall off in a slower revenue growth environment. We of course, would look to slow discretionary spending, T&E, other outside services, as an example. And we can slow hiring, right? Comp [indiscernible] is obviously a meaningful part of our overall expense picture, and we can harvest voluntary turnover attrition as well. So -- and then in more severe scenarios, there are other levers to pull. And so, we model those things. We're not, however, going to damage the business in the medium to long term, right? We want to grow our business and be there for our clients. And we know not far down the road there'll be a brighter economic picture than there is today. So -- and again, we have a track record across economic cycles. Again, we know the levers to pull and we will pull them as we see data emerge that requires it. Do you have a follow-up, Mike?
Mike Zaremski: Yes, quick follow-up. I don't know if you have any -- I think what you cited in the Marsh Pricing Index that global property continued to decelerate kind of quarter-over-quarter. I know global property, if you look back over many years, pricing accelerated a lot. I'm just kind of curious, does it -- I know you guys are working hard, obviously, to get your clients better rate, but would you expect at a macro level global property rates that continue to be a negative territory, kind of assuming normal catastrophe levels just given just the extent of how hard that market was for a long period of time. I don't know if there's any terms of conditions changes that are taking place or any color there it seems to be the -- I think we all know casualties is the problem trial, but property seems like it's continues to soften so just looking for color. Thanks.
John Doyle: Yes. Sure, Mike. Maybe I'll share a couple of high-level comments and then I'll ask both Martin and Dean just to talk about what they see in the market. So as I said, we expected a bit of a softer market. Prices, I'm not declaring it a soft market, just to be clear, but prices softened a bit in the quarter. We expected that. And it is, as you point out, welcome relief to our clients after five years of pricing. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, you've seen strong underwriting results for both insurers and reinsurers. And given those results, they're more growth oriented maybe than they've been over the course of the last couple of years. Property was the most notable rate of increased decline. On the other side, as you point out, casualty, particularly casualty here in the United States and excess liability, that market is under some stress from our client's perspective. But Martin, maybe you could talk a little bit about the insurance market in the quarter and share some thoughts with Mike.
Martin South: Of course, Delighted to. As we mentioned, our global rate index declined 3% in Q1. It's the third sequential course of rate declines. And overall, though, the composite rate index remains up 1.5 times since its inception in 2012. So to your point, it's been a long period of pain for our clients. Just going through the lines of coverage, casualty saw rates of 4% globally, the most consistent to the last quarter. The U.S. continued to see rate increase at the highest level, 8% across the board and 16% in the umbrella and excess casualty. Property is down 6%, with the US and the Pacific experienced the largest decreases, followed by the UK at 6%, and all other regions saw low single-digit declines. FinPro is down 6%, Cyber down 6% reflecting previous trends. But keep in mind that our index skews to larger account as we mentioned. We have a diversified business with large exposures to the middle market where pricing tends to be less cyclical. However, our focus is obtaining the best outcome for our clients with the lowest coverages and the best value and we continue to do an excellent job doing that.
John Doyle: Thank you, Martin. Dean, maybe you could share some thoughts on the reinsurance market.
Dean Klisura: Great. Thanks, John. And Mike, I'll give you a little bit of color on the April 1 reinsurance market, mostly focused on property cat here, which I think a key driver in the ecosystem of the market. But at April 1, we saw a continuation of market conditions that we experienced in January 1. As John noted, we continue to see a very competitive market with a modest increase in client demand, mostly from personal lines and E&S riders that are both driving underlying primary insurance rate increases. As John noted, capacity in the property market has been ample, driven by very strong reinsure returns in 2024, reported at 16% as an indices. The reinsure appetite for property cat continues to increase. They're writing more. They've been more aggressive. But I think the real takeaway, the headline, Mike, is that, the California wildfires had really little or no impact on pricing terms and conditions in the property cat market at April 1. John talked about US property cat, we saw 5% to 15% rate decreases for non-loss impacted accounts. Turning to Japan, which John touched on. We saw a very orderly property cat renewal at April 1. Again, capacity was strong. Many of our cat programs were oversubscribed in the market. We see stable demand from clients in Japan really offset by greater increases in capacity. Few structural changes, attachment points that were hard fought two years ago literally stayed unchanged in the Japanese marketplace. And property cat rates were down 10% to 15% on average in Japan. Again, really no impact from the California wildfires on the Japanese market. Capital is plentiful in the reinsurance market. We talked about at the January 1 renewal that dedicated reinsurance capital was up 7%. We see capital increasing. We see reinsurers deploying more capital. We see a very strong [ILS] (ph) market. John talked about record cat bond issuance. So, all these things are adding up to additional capital and capital deployment in the property cat market.
John Doyle: Thank you, Dean. Mike, just one last thought is, the market's now pricing in well in excess of $100 billion of insured cat losses. So it's obviously early in the year. Though, as you know, Guy Carpenter's biggest quarters are the first and second quarter, right? So that's really a reflection of treaty renewals and where they are in the calendar. So impacts to us will be really down the road if the cat season turns out to be very different than what we expect. But thank you, Mike. Andrew, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hey, Good morning. So I had a question just first on all of our environment. And I'm assuming that the uncertainty and all the trade talk is creating some demand in certain verticals. But overall, is the environment and the increased uncertainty positive or is it overall a negative for Oliver Wyman just as companies are sort of pulling back from budgets and just activities declining?
John Doyle: Yes. Thanks Jimmy. We had I think a good start to the year for Oliver Wyman. It was on -- 4% growth on top of 13% last year. So just a big, big quarter a year ago. So a tough comp. But sales have been solid. As you point out, it is discretionary spend, so maybe I'll ask Nick to share a little bit more color about what we're seeing in that market.
Nick Studer: Thank you, Jimmy. Maybe just a bit of context, which I know I often put in place first, but we do see this through the cycle as a mid to high single digit growth business, and we have been in a bumpier part of the cycle on the demand side. The geopolitical policy and economic uncertainty is not brand new. But also on the supply side, we've had a couple of years where oversupply in the industry has been working its way through. And you'll have noted, we did not appear on the list of large suppliers to the US government, but that has created some increased oversupply. But notwithstanding all of that bumpiness, the market continues to grow. We are very happy with the first quarter, as John said, given the high comp. Within that, as you note, there are some strong areas of growth. The US and Canada Mark called out, but also our insurance and asset management and actuarial practices which are increasingly working closely together have standout growth. We saw good growth in consumer telecoms and technology. Also very strong growth in transportation and advanced industrials. And our banking practice as well did well. And our finance risk and restructuring practices were also in double digits. Less even growth elsewhere. I think to get to the nub of your question, as you know, we have relatively short visibility. When the big questions for our clients change, that tends to be very good for our business. When there's a lot of confusion and short-term uncertainty, that is less so. It can often lead to a little bit of a freeze. I don't think current events necessarily presage a tougher period ahead. It's a bit too early to tell, so we're on watch. But for now, we remain very busy. We're confident in our ability to help our clients in their most transformative moments when the big questions change.
John Doyle: Thank you, Nick. Jimmy, do you have a follow-up?
Jimmy Bhullar: Yes, maybe just for Dean. You gave some good color on renewals recently, 1/1 and April as well. Are you expecting media renewals to be similar in terms of terms and changes in attachment points and pricing or do you expect a change one way or the other?
Dean Klisura: Yes. Thanks, John. The answer is, yes. We expect a continuation of market conditions that we experienced at January 1 and April 1. The market in Florida remains very stable despite the hurricanes last fall. We expect cat pricing to be very, very similar as 1/1 and 4/1. We see an adequate supply of capital in the Florida market. And certainly the active cat bond market has kind of bolstered that impact to capacity. We see clients buying more property cat limit at the January -- sorry, June 1 renewal. And we starting to see benefits from the Florida legal reforms, really lowering frequency and severity in Florida market. So definitively yes to your question moving forward.
John Doyle: Thank you, Dean. And thank you, Jimmy. Andrew, next question, please.
Operator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just another question, just given the macro environment and some of the policy questions. Could you help me think through how much exposure Marsh has across the company to government consulting or government contracts?
John Doyle: Yes, thanks David for the question. Nick talked about it, touched on it a bit in terms of US governments at Oliver Wyman. We do work for governments all over the world and most of that work is in Oliver Wyman, then Mercer, but Marsh and GC have a little bit of it as well. A lot of that work is really important advice. I talked about resilience and sustainable development in my prepared marks. A lot of the work is around that, those subjects. But what I would say to you David is that, overall, that work is not material to the company overall.
David Motemaden: Great, thanks. And then could you just help me think through the underlying revenue growth slowdown in Marsh within US and Canada specifically? I know the comp was tougher, but I'm wondering, was it all just the pricing slowdown, or was there any impact from maybe a little bit of overlap with McGriff and some of the existing Marsh book. Just looking for a little bit of color there. Thanks.
John Doyle: Yeah, for sure and I'll ask Martin to jump in, but unrelated at all to McGriff and as Mark noted, McGriff's not in our underlying revenue calculation, and we couldn't be more pleased with how McGriff has gone to date. We've got a lot of work still in front of us, but so far so good, and remain very, very excited about that. But, Mark, maybe you could talk about growth in the US in particular.
Martin South: Of course, John, yes. So, a solid start to the year with 5% growth, which as you say was on top of a big comp. And in the US in particular, US growing at 4%, which is on top of eight in 1Q 2024, still strong performance in MMA and whilst McGriff is not in our underlying growth, we're thrilled to their start of the year. Specialty performance was particularly strong. We saw an uptick in FinPro. Offsetting this performance, there was weakness in construction and property. Construction really is a reduction in new business driven by some of the uncertainty around the geopolitical environment and the cost to rebuild. And property rates accelerated their decline to 9%. So, once we don't -- look to one quarter to grow to evaluate performance over time, our US business has seen tremendous growth in the post pandemic area. We're very well positioned in the future and our international business continues to grow well. 6% on top of 8% in the first quarter of 2024. And so strong new business growth. Latin America, 8% on top of 8% in Q1 last year. EMEA, 6% on top of 9%. APAC, 4% on top of 6%. And particularly strong growth in our benefits business, which is performing well around the world.
John Doyle: Thank you. Thanks Martin. And thank you David. Andrew, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Barclays.
Alex Scott: Hey, good morning. I think a couple of different times you mentioned how much your indices kind of skewed towards the larger end of the market. So I was wondering if you could give maybe some color on what you're seeing in your middle market business and just if there is a divergence, how big is that divergence you're seeing in terms of how cyclical the businesses are to pricing.
John Doyle: Yes, Alex, thanks for the question and good morning to you as well. It's interesting and I think it's not a recent phenomenon, but really over a long period of time where the middle market tends to provide much more consistent pricing from year-to-year. So middle market pricing was essentially up a couple of points in the quarter. You'll hear underwriters, of course insurers, report on rate change throughout the earning season here. The biggest difference between what they report and what we report is new business. And so, we have a view, because it was our client a year ago, of how that rate change materialized. And typically, new business will trade at a slightly better price from the client's perspective than a business that has renewed. But the gap is what you see. A couple of points favorable in the middle market is what we observed here in the United States. And large account market can move much more in a cyclical fashion. Do you have a follow up Alex?
Alex Scott: Yes, and thanks for that response. The other one I wanted to ask about is just, when I think through a lot of these numbers you're throwing out, property, there is a bit of a headwind there in terms of pricing. Your clients are getting some relief. But do we need to think about 2Q and just be in a more property heavy renewal quarter? I mean, how much seasonality -- I guess it's not typical seasonality, but just how much year-over-year do we need to be thinking about for property specific to 2Q because of that concentration?
John Doyle: Yes, look, I think it's hard to predict future markets. Dean talked about it in terms of reinsurance. There is a seasonality to the reinsurance business, right? So with a lot of property cat exposure, of course, being in the United states and because insurance companies want to have some level of certainty around what their reinsurance programs look like as they pursue their goals during the course of the year. The beginning part of the year is where really almost all of the action is from a reinsurance perspective. So, Dean spoke to that. It's been a competitive market and it's really a reflection of what's been very strong underwriting results at insurers and reinsurers. And as I said, many of them are looking to grow, given the results they've printed the last couple of years. So we expected that, for sure. At Marsh, it's going to be in a retail business, it's going to be more account to account and driven by some market forces of course, but ultimate loss experience by clients. So, again, we continue to see an increase in frequency and severity of [NatCats] (ph), not just here in the United States. And we see inflation continuing to be a challenge. So over time, we think the cost of risk is continuing to rise. It's why I spent some time in my prepared remarks talking about the need for communities to invest in resilience. There's, in my view, too much discussion about how to find cheap insurance or subsidize insurance. Of course, insurance costs are important to a local economy. I'm not trying to discount the importance of that. But ultimately the way to deal with that is to bend the risk curve and we need investment. We have much more exposure to cat prone areas than we've had in the past. And so we'll manage through the cycle of pricing. We expect it to be more competitive throughout the year. But over time, those costs are continuing to grow. Thank you, Alex. Andrew, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. From an external perspective, in other words, from our perspective, how should we think about the impact of reinsurance pricing impacting Guy Carpenter’s organic growth? Is it comparable to what we see in primary insurance our dynamics different there? And how does the, I guess, significant amount of lost impacted accounts coming up for renewal at mid-year impact organic growth prospects for Guy Carpenter?
John Doyle: Yes, thanks, Meyer. What I would say is, if you recall when reinsurance pricing was going up meaningfully, we talked a bit about this because I think you all were trying to get a sense of revenue growth to the upside in our business there. We get paid in commission at Guy Carpenter, but of course, we're very transparent with insurance company clients, and so we negotiate essentially an outcome and so in some respects it can act fee-like, but again with pricing pressure that does impact our revenue line overall. We thought we had a terrific start to the year at Guy Carpenter, some of the market forces that helped what's been just an outstanding period of growth over the last couple of years have subsided. But again, we've factored that into our guidance. And the work we do on behalf of insurance companies is absolutely critical, helping them navigate the complexity and the volatility that economies and of course natural catastrophe is a huge part of that. So again, think commission, but also think negotiated outcomes.
Meyer Shields: Okay. No, that's very helpful.
John Doyle: Do you have a follow-up, Meyer?
Meyer Shields: Yes, just a quick one. You talked about the overall EPS impact from foreign exchange. Did that impact either of the segment's margins materially?
John Doyle: Mark, maybe you can jump in.
Mark McGivney: Yes, Meyer, no, FX was not a story for margins in the quarter. And actually, the impact, even on earnings segment to segment was pretty even.
John Doyle: And Meyer, I would just add that the headwinds on margin expansion came from M&A, right? And primarily McGriff, but the other deals that I mentioned last year as well, and Mark and I both have mentioned the seasonality of McGriff revenues. All those businesses clearly make us better. So happy to trade, a quarter of margin contraction for what will become a bigger and better business as a result of those deals. Thank you. Andrew, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I wanted to go back to Guy Carpenter. On the 5% organic growth in the quarter, I was just trying to get a better sense of what's driving that. I know you guys are talking about pricing demand, et cetera, but what kind of drove the slowdown there in the quarter? And I'm particularly interested if you can give us a sense of new business as well as renewal trends in the Q1 within that 5%.
John Doyle: Sure, sure. So, Elyse, again, we're pleased with the start to the year at Guy Carpenter with 5% growth. We had an excellent start to the year. Last year, we had 8% underlying growth in the quarter. Client demand for our services remains quite strong. Obviously, as we just talked about with Meyer, pricing impacts growth, at least in the near term. But, Dean, maybe you could share some thoughts on where we see opportunities for growth and some of the contributing factors aside from price that impacted us in the quarter.
Dean Klisura: Yes, thanks, John and good morning, Elyse. As John noted, property cat is a growth headwind in the quarter and moving forward. But again, we saw very balanced growth globally across our regions and our global specialty business. We're driving outstanding growth in Latin America and the Middle East where we've invested heavily. To your point, Elyse, we had very strong new business in the quarter, including record cat bond issuance. Guy Carpenter placed eight discrete bonds in the quarter, totaling $1.8 billion of limit, maybe our strongest quarter ever in the cat bond market. We're seeing great opportunities from our new capital and advisory practice. And we started a small boutique banking practice for raising capital for clients, for providing M&A advisory, for designing side cars, reciprocals and other capital structures for clients and that business is really going well. And we do see clients purchasing additional property cat limit, given favorable market conditions. And so, as you know, and Meyer asked the same question, the first quarter is 50% of our year revenue-wise, so that's out of the way. And we feel solid about our prospects for growth through the balance of the year.
John Doyle: Thank you. Dean. Elyse, do you have a follow-up?
Elyse Greenspan: Yes. My follow-up question, I was hoping that maybe you'd be willing to disclose the revenue growth McGriff saw in the quarter. And then is there seasonality we need to think about in the other three quarters of the year, or is it more consistent revenue and margins relative to obviously there was a negative seasonality in the Q1?
John Doyle: Yes, I'm not going to get into disclosing revenue by sub-business and sub-business quarter to quarter, but as we said, it was a good start to the year for McGriff. We're very, very pleased with the results to date. And while on McGriff, again, it's a business we admired for a long time. They've had a similar approach to really creating client value to our company. Colleague retention and notably producer retention has been outstanding to date. So it was a good start. It extends our reach into the middle market, which we really like. They had industry and specialty capability that we know can strengthen MMA as well. And now positions MMA as about a $5 billion business on an annual basis. And so, possibilities for us to bring scale benefits to middle market clients is a real opportunity there. So, I don't think there's any kind of big lumps up and down, Mark, but maybe you could talk more about the seasonality for McGriff for the rest of the year.
Mark McGivney: Yes, Q1 is their softest quarter from a revenue perspective. Q2, Q4 tend to be their biggest, so Q3…
John Doyle: Not softer, they're smaller.
Mark McGivney: Smaller.
John Doyle: Yes, it wasn't so, it was good growth.
Mark McGivney: Q3 will be a little bit of a seasonal lull as well but nothing on the order of what we saw in Q1. So the trend we saw in Q1 will moderate as we go through the year.
John Doyle: Terrific. Thank you, Mark. Thanks, Elyse. Andrew, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.
Paul Newsome: Good morning. I was hoping to focus a little bit more on M&A. And if you had any thoughts if the increased uncertainty will change the M&A outlook, either for you or for the market.
John Doyle: Thanks, Paul, for the question. No I don't think so. I mean, we're again quite active in that market. There are businesses out there, much like I've described, McGriff, that we've admired for a long time and we think can make us better. We think we can bring benefits to those businesses as well. And so, it's -- when we acquire companies, we know them, right? We spend a lot of time thinking about culture, thinking about fit, and thinking about the possibilities for growing together. So we have a long-term view of it. What the macro environment does to the cost of capital or for other investor interest in some of these businesses is a different thing, who knows. But we are 154 years old this year. We've been a consolidator for 154 years and we continue to see that as an opportunity. And it doesn't just deliver for the shareholder. Well, of course, we want to deliver growth for all of you. As I said before, we can bring scale benefits to the middle market that can enable greater economic sustainability and greater success for clients in the middle market. So it starts with client value and acquiring talent that can help us make that happen. Do you have a follow up, Paul?
Paul Newsome: Great. I do. A little bit more of a detailed question. There's a lot of wonderful commentary about the property cat reinsurance market. One question I had was about whether or not you thought -- the firm thought, that the tort reform in Florida was having any impact as well, given that's obviously a peak mode for property cat regionally.
John Doyle: Yeah, thanks Paul. I think Dean mentioned it very briefly, but it's early, but the early signs have been positive, right? I chose to spend a little bit of time in my prepared remarks talking about resilience and the important to invest in resilience by communities. In the case of Florida, they're obviously largely focused on the property cat market, those reforms. There are important reforms in Georgia that are being rolled out now that attack more of the liability issues. I mentioned the rising cost of risk and I referenced in my prepared remarks social inflation. Some of the insurance companies that we do business with don't even like that label. They prefer to call it legal system abuse. But the litigation environment here in the United States is clearly a tax on our economy. And so, we're working to support sensible reforms by state and at their federal government level because it continues to be a challenge. But I think the steps Florida took are helpful. We'll see ultimately where it goes. Keep an eye on what happened there in Georgia. I think those are important steps as well. And of course, state by state, you've got different challenges. Different legislature makeup is going to be different state to state as well. And so -- but we're investing against those issues to try to help our clients navigate what's a very expensive litigation environment here in the U.S. Thank you, Paul. Andrew, with that, we're ready to wrap up. I want to thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. Thank you all very much, and we look forward to speaking with you all next quarter.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-01-30 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh McLennan's Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Fourth quarter 2024 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most recently comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions] I’ll now turn the call over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.
John Doyle: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. On the call with me is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Pat Tomlinson of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Jay Gelb who recently joined Marsh McLennan as our new Head of Investor Relations. Many of you know Jay from his time as an equity analyst covering the insurance industry. Before I discuss our results, I want to take a moment to comment on the California wildfires. These events represent a profound human tragedy. Lives have been lost and tens of thousands of people have been left homeless and hurting. Among those affected are Marsh McLennan colleagues and clients in the Los Angeles area, and our company is committed to doing everything we can to support them during this challenging time. With regard to the wildfire's impact on the insurance industry, insured losses are expected to exceed $30 billion. This means the LA Wildfires will be among the top 10 largest natural disasters in history in terms of insured losses. The increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters, along with rising property values and continued development in catastrophe prone areas, underscore the need for greater resilience and risk mitigation planning. Marsh McLennan will continue to bring together stakeholders including individuals, businesses, the insurance industry and governments to build the resilience, to mitigate the devastating impact from these catastrophic events and to accelerate recovery. Turning to our results. 2024 was a milestone year for Marsh McLennan. We executed against our strategic objectives, generated excellent financial performance, and had the largest year of acquisitions in our history. Total revenue grew 8% to $24.5 billion. We generated 7% underlying revenue growth, continuing our best stretch of growth in more than two decades, with both risk and insurance services and consulting delivering strong results. Our adjusted operating income grew 11% to $6.2 billion. This is on top of 17% growth in 2023. Our adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points, marking the 17th consecutive year of reported margin expansion and adjusted EPS grew 10%. In addition to another year of excellent financial performance, we continued to execute on our key priorities. We had a record year of M&A by investing $9.4 billion in acquisitions, including our $7.75 billion acquisition of McGriff. We also delivered significant capital return to shareholders, raising our dividend by 15% and completing $900 million of share repurchases. And we successfully completed our restructuring program, achieving the goals we set two years ago, accelerating client impact, reinvesting in our capabilities, boosting efficiency, and increasing collaboration across the firm. Let me touch briefly on our acquisition of McGriff, which closed on November 15th. McGriff has great momentum and I couldn't be more excited to have them join Marsh McLennan Agency. Our integration is proceeding according to plan, and although it's early days, our fundamental outlook remains the same. As I said when we announced the transaction, it's a business with excellent leadership, outstanding talent, and a record of strong growth. The addition of McGriff also extends our presence and capabilities in the growing middle market. It's worth noting that MMA would be the fifth largest broker in the United States on a standalone basis. In addition to McGriff, we completed several other notable acquisitions including two top 100 agencies in MMA as well as Vanguard's OCIO Business and Cardano in Mercer. As we start the New Year, I want to take a moment to give you an update on our strategy. First and foremost, we are a growth company that is well-positioned globally in market leading businesses with significant opportunities. We strive for outstanding near-term results while also investing to sustain our strong performance over the long-term. We consistently reinvest a significant portion of our cash flow into organic investments, particularly in talent, technology and capabilities. Innovations like Sentrisk, Blue[i], LenAI and other digital tools are examples of how we are delivering value for our colleagues and clients. Investing in data and insights enables us to work smarter on behalf of our clients, helping them gain the perspective needed to pursue their ambitions. We also maintain a balanced approach to capital management. We look to maintain financial flexibility as we manage the efficiency of our capital structure. We have a bias to reinvest the capital we generate into high quality acquisitions. However, we also recognize that returning capital to shareholders delivers meaningful value over time and each year we target raising our dividend and repurchasing enough stock to reduce our share count. A focus on high quality acquisitions is also an important part of our growth strategy. Over the past decade, we've invested approximately $24 billion in M&A across more than 200 transactions that have accelerated our growth at attractive returns. These acquisitions extend our reach, enhance our capabilities and boost our scale. The growth plans of our businesses remain at the core of our strategy. At the same time, we're working together better than ever to capture opportunities at the intersections of our businesses, and we constantly challenge ourselves to operate more efficiently. We've expanded our operating margin by over 900 basis points in the past decade, and we've improved our margin by nearly 500 basis points in the last five years alone. This has been achieved primarily through increasing efficiencies and other operating expenses while continuing to grow our talent base. Despite these gains, we still see opportunities for further improvement. While the core tenets of growth, discipline and balanced investment will continue to underpin our strategy, we are constantly evolving to deliver greater value to our clients and all of our stakeholders. Turning to insurance market conditions, the global insurance and reinsurance market remains dynamic. At nearly $130 billion 2024 was the fifth consecutive year of more than $100 billion of insured natural catastrophe losses. Despite an elevated risk landscape, the Marsh global insurance market index decreased by 2% in the fourth quarter compared to a 1% decline in the third quarter. As a reminder, our index skews to large account business. Overall, rates in the US were flat. Latin America was up low single digits. Europe, UK and Asia were down low to mid-single digits and Pacific was down high single digits. Global property rates declined 3% compared to down 2% in the third quarter. Global casualty rates increased 4% with US excess casualty up approximately 15% in the quarter. Workers' compensation decreased mid-single digits. Global financial and professional liability rates were down 6%, while cyber decreased 7%. In reinsurance, underwriting discipline persisted, particularly on program retentions. Capacity increased at a more significant pace than client demand. In global property, cat reinsurance accounts not impacted by loss saw risk adjusted rates down 5% to 15%, while risk adjusted rates for loss impacted accounts were flat to up 30%. Casualty renewals were completed with varying outcomes. Excessive loss placements continue to face pressure on treaty terms. Quota shares were more stable with sufficient capacity, while seeding commissions were flat to slightly down. Turning to health trends. Our surveys indicate medical costs are expected to increase 11% on a global basis in 2025. This would be the fifth consecutive year of at least a 10% increase. On a regional basis, the pace of anticipated increase is 8% in North America, 9% in the Pacific region, 10% in both Europe and Latin America, 11% in the Middle East and Africa, and 13% in Asia. For employee sponsored health plans in the US, the total health benefit cost per employee is expected to rise 5.8% on average in 2025. After accounting for planned cost reduction measures. This would be the third consecutive year of cost growth around 5%. As always, our focus on helping our clients navigate these dynamic market conditions. Now let me turn to our fourth quarter financial performance which Mark will cover in more detail. We are pleased with our fourth quarter performance where growth remains strong and solid earnings capped another terrific year. Revenue grew 7% on an underlying basis with 8% growth in RIS and 6% in consulting. We had adjusted operating income of 9%, and we generated adjusted EPS in the quarter of $1.87 which is up 11% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook for 2025. We are well-positioned for another strong year. We currently expect mid-single-digit underlying revenue growth including an anticipated headwind from fiduciary income along with continued margin expansion and solid adjusted EPS growth. Our outlook assumes current macro conditions persist. However, the environment remains uncertain and the economic backdrop could be materially different than our assumptions. In summary, we are pleased with our performance in 2024. We executed against our strategic objectives and continued our track record of delivering strong results. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, John and good morning. Our solid fourth quarter results reflected continued momentum and capped an excellent year with strong underlying revenue growth, double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. Our consolidated revenue increased 9% in the fourth quarter to $6.1 billion with underlying growth of 7%. Operating income was $1.1 billion and adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion, up 9%. Our adjusted operating margin was 23.3%. GAAP EPS was $1.59. Adjusted EPS increased 11% to $1.87 and included a $0.05 benefit from favorable discrete tax items and a $0.02 headwind from foreign exchange. For the full year, underlying revenue growth was 7%. Adjusted operating income grew 11% to $6.2 billion; adjusted EPS grew 10% to $8.80; and our adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 26.8%, marking our 17th consecutive year of reported margin expansion. 2024 was also a record year for capital deployment. We invested $9.4 billion in acquisitions, the largest year in our history. We also raised our quarterly dividend 15% and bought back 900 million of our stock. Looking at risk and insurance services. Fourth quarter revenue was $3.6 billion, up 11% or 8% on an underlying basis. Operating income in RIS increased 2% to $770 million. Adjusted operating income increased 13% to $893 million, and our adjusted margin was 27%. For the full year, revenue in RIS was $15.4 billion with underlying growth of 8%. Adjusted operating income increased 13% to $4.6 billion, and our adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 32%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $3.3 billion, up 15% from a year ago or 8% on an underlying basis, reflecting continued growth across our regions as well as a rebound in transaction risk products and claims activity in our Torrent flood business. This result marks the 16th consecutive quarter of 6% or higher underlying growth at Marsh. In US and Canada, underlying growth was 8% for the quarter. In international, underlying growth was 9%, with Latin America up 13%, EMEA up 9% and Asia-Pacific up 6%. For the full year, Marsh's revenue was $12.5 billion with underlying growth of 7%. US and Canada was up 7% and international grew 8%. Guy Carpenter's revenue in the quarter was $201 million, up 7% on an underlying basis, driven by growth across our regions and global specialties. For the year, revenue was $2.4 billion, representing 8% underlying growth, Guy Carpenter's fourth consecutive year of 8% or higher underlying growth. In the Consulting segment, fourth quarter revenue was $2.4 billion, up 6% on both a GAAP and underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $466 million and adjusted operating income was $484 million, up 1%. Our adjusted operating margin in consulting was 20.7% compared to 21.3% a year ago, reflecting seasonality in the impact of acquisitions and dispositions. For the full year, consulting revenue was $9.1 billion with underlying growth of 6%. Adjusted operating income increased 6% to $1.8 billion and our adjusted operating margin increased 30 basis points to 20.7%. Mercer's revenue was $1.5 billion in the quarter, up 5% on an underlying basis. This was Mercer's 15th consecutive quarter of 5% or higher underlying growth and continues the best run of growth in over 15 years. Health underlying growth was 5% in the quarter, reflecting growth across all regions. Wealth was up 4%, led by growth in investment management. Our assets under management were $617 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 13% sequentially and up 47% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Year-over-year growth was driven by our transactions with Cardano and Vanguard. Positive net flows and the impact of capital markets. Career increased 7%, driven by growth in talent and rewards, surveys and products. For the year, revenue at Mercer was $5.7 billion, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis. The fourth straight year of 5% or higher underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the fourth quarter was $954 million, an increase of 7% on an underlying basis. This reflects growth across all regions and businesses and was achieved despite a tough comparison to 9% growth in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, Oliver Wyman's revenue was $3.4 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 6%. Fiduciary income was $112 million in the quarter, a decline of $26 million from the third quarter, reflecting lower interest rates. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2025, we expect fiduciary income will be approximately $100 million. Foreign exchange was a $0.02 headwind in the fourth quarter and a $0.05 headwind for the full year. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX will be a headwind of $0.04 in the first quarter and $0.09 for all of 2025. Turning to our McGriff transaction, we closed the deal in mid-November and as John mentioned, the integration is going well. McGriff is a terrific business and we're excited about what they bring to MMA. In November we issued $7.25 billion of senior notes to fund the transaction. The first quarter is McGriff's seasonally smallest from a revenue perspective, so for Q1 we expect McGriff will be modestly dilutive to adjusted EPS. However, I want to emphasize that we continue to expect McGriff will be modestly accretive to adjusted EPS for full year 2025, becoming more meaningfully accretive in 2026 and beyond. We expect noteworthy charges associated with McGriff of approximately $450 million to $500 million in total over the next three years, with the vast majority of these costs associated with retention incentives, a significant portion of which was put in place by the seller. These costs flow to our financial statements, but were funded by the seller through a purchase price adjustment. Also note that we will exclude McGriff from our underlying growth calculations for the first year as is our convention. Total noteworthy items in the quarter were $154 million, including $136 million of restructuring costs, primarily related to the program we began in the fourth quarter of 2022. Interest expense in the fourth quarter was $231 million, up from $151 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase reflects higher levels of debt as well as $26 million of bridge financing fees associated with the McGriff transaction. Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense in the first quarter 2025 of approximately $246 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 21.1% compared with 25.5% in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year 2024, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% compared with 24% in 2023. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate in 2024 was 25.8% compared with 25% in 2023. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of between 25% and 26% in 2025. Turning to capital management. Our balance sheet, we ended the year with total debt of $19.9 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in the first quarter of 2025, when 500 million of senior notes mature. Our cash position at the end of the fourth quarter was $2.4 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $8.5 billion and included $403 million for dividends and $8.1 billion for acquisitions, including McGriff. For the year, uses of cash totaled $11.8 billion, included $1.5 billion for dividends, $9.4 billion for acquisitions, and $900 million for share repurchase. Looking to 2025, based on our outlook today, we expect to deploy approximately $4.5 billion of capital across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. As we discussed last quarter, beginning in the first quarter of 2025, we will exclude the impact of acquisition related intangible amortization and the other net benefit credit from adjusted EPS. We provided tables in our fourth quarter earnings release that recast adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS for the past eight quarters on this basis. Turning to 2025. As John noted, we remain positive in our outlook for growth. For 2025, we currently expect mid-single-digit underlying revenue growth, margin expansion and solid growth in adjusted EPS. This outlook contemplates anticipated headwinds from short term interest rate declines, foreign exchange and favorable discrete tax items in 2024. We expect these headwinds will have a more significant impact in the first quarter, which will also reflect a difficult revenue growth comparison versus a year ago. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in 2024. We have momentum across our business and are well-positioned for another strong year in 2025. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to John.
John Doyle: Thank you. Mark. Andrew, we are ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on margin. So, the margin was flat overall right in the fourth quarter. But earlier in the year you guys had pointed to second half margin improvement being greater than the first half, which didn't transpire. So, I'm just trying to get a sense of what went on with the margins in the second half relative to prior expectations and also specifically the fourth quarter.
John Doyle: Yeah. Good morning, Elyse. I was pleased with our margin expansion for the year. 80 bps of margin expansion, our 17th consecutive year. As we've talked about in the past, from quarter to quarter, it'll be different outcomes and really 17 consecutive years, just says it's a reflection of our disciplined approach to the way we run our business and it's not a primary objective. Margins are an outcome of the way we run the business and we're going to continue to make attractive investments. They're going to drive medium to longer term growth in the company as well. The fourth quarter was impacted by FX. It was also impacted by acquisitions and divestitures, but it wasn't a disappointment. It was a good strong year of margin expansion. And as we guided to for 2025, we expect it to be our 18th consecutive year of margin expansion. And we've got opportunities to continue to focus on the shared infrastructure across the company. We have some opportunities in operations. We've got important workflow optimization efforts happening at Marsh, Mercer and Guy Carpenter and, of course, automation is an important lever for us too. And as we learn and continue to test and experiment around AI and we see possibilities there as well, so. So, we're quite optimistic about the possibilities looking forward. And we were pleased with the outcome in 2024. Do you have a follow up?
Elyse Greenspan: Yeah. My second question is on free cash flow. I know you guys typically haven't provided annual guidance, but the growth there was 4% in '24. I think when I look at the CAGR over the past few years it was around 7%. So, both below double-digits. So, I'm not sure if there was anything in '24 that was impacted by McGriff, but anything you could provide just in terms of what impacted free cash flow in '24 and how we should think about growth headwinds and tailwinds in free cash flow in 2025?
John Doyle: Yeah. I don't have a three-year CAGR in front of me, but I know we had north of 20% free cash flow growth in '23 and 4% I believe in 2024. It's obviously not going to attract as a straight line or as consistently with earnings growth, but over time it will. Mark, do you have anything to add there?
Mark McGivney: Yeah. Free cash flow, we were really pleased with 4%. As John mentioned, we were up 28% last year. So, kind of holding that and growing a little bit is not bad. And if you look over the last five years, we've doubled free cash flow since 2019. So that has been a very good story for us given the nature of our business. As we've talked about, you would expect free cash flow would track our earnings growth over time and it certainly has over a long stretch we've had double-digit growth in free cash flow. And as you pointed out, we don't typically give guidance because it can be volatile period to period, year to year, but over time it will track and should track in line with our earnings growth and as our guidance suggests, we have an outlook for earnings growth into the future.
John Doyle: Thank you, Elyse. Andrew, next question please.
Operator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hey, good morning. First, just a question for Mark. I think you mentioned you expect organic growth of mid-single digits in 2025. I think previously you'd been saying mid to high -- or mid-single digits are better. So, I'm not sure if I'm reading too much into your comments, or is there a change that you're seeing in any aspect of your business that's making you adjust the language slightly?
John Doyle: Hey Jimmy, it's John. Let me jump in front of Mark. First of all, I just want to talk about our strong finish to the year. 7% in the fourth quarter underlying revenue growth. Terrific full year revenue growth as well. And the strength was really broad based in the quarter. Marsh 8%. Guy Carpenter is a seasonally small quarter. Put a really good finish to what was an excellent year at Guy carpenter. Mercer above 5% underlying growth again and a better finishing career where as you know, growth's been a bit soft over the course of the last year or so. And Oliver Wyman had a strong finish too, where we're starting to see some demand pick up. The macros remain largely supportive of growth. Fiduciary income, as we mentioned, is the one real exception to it. But economic growth in most major markets remains resilient. Strong labor markets in most of the economies that we're exposed to. Of course, there are a lot of risks out there, big geopolitical risks, uncertainty around tariffs and potential trade wars. As I talked about, the frequency of extreme weather impacts economies around the world as well. And then, risks around technology and other areas. But those are areas that we help our clients and give them advice so that they can invest with a level of confidence. So, we're optimistic about growth for 2025. I wouldn't read much into it. We feel like we're well-positioned. We continue to invest and shape the mix of our business. McGriff coming in and then admin businesses at Mercer going out in 2024 would be a good example of our focus there. And so, our team's highly engaged and we're executing well. So, we feel good entering 2025.
Jimmy Bhullar: And just on McGriff, should we assume that it actually is a positive for your organic growth beyond '25, just given their market focus and the fact that they'll be part of a larger platform. So maybe they could do a little bit better than they might have done in the past, or should we not expect much of an impact on their or your growth as a result?
John Doyle: We're excited about McGriff. As Mark noted, from an earnings point of view, it'll be slightly dilutive to us or modestly dilutive to us early in the year, but accretive over the full year and more so in '26 and beyond. I talked about it. So far, so good in terms of the integration. Culturally, things seem to be going well. McGriff's a business that we've admired for a long time, as a competitor. We knew there were going to be a few big assets in the market in 2024. And McGriff was the business that we wanted. And it doesn't just make us bigger, they make us better. They've got terrific talent and leadership. As I talked about, they got some real specialty capabilities and it extends our reach into the middle market where we're quite focused on bringing scale benefits to that segment of the market. So, we're excited about McGriff.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
John Doyle: Thank you, Jimmy. Andrew, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Barclays.
Alex Scott: Hey, good morning. First one I have for you is on Marsh. I just want to see if you could help us unpack the strong organic growth. I mean, just with rates in the US being more flattish, I'm guessing most of that came from growth in the book and was just interested if you had any comments on new business versus retention. Maybe just helping us understand the underlying dynamics where you're winning.
John Doyle: Sure. Alex, again, really strong finish. I'll ask Martin to comment in a second here. We're really well-positioned. In terms of rates, I would say, we're most exposed to pricing through commission in the middle market. So, it's a subset of our business overall. So, it's an impact. It does have an impact. Of course, pricing does, but we have a lot of fee-based business as well. Mark commented on the notable pickup in M&A activity in the quarter that certainly helped with growth in the quarter and we see a more positive environment there going forward as well. But Martin, maybe you could share a little bit more color on the broad-based growth we had at Marsh in the quarter.
Martin South: Of course, John. So, we had a great year in '24, 7% on top of 8% in '23. Good balance of growth throughout the globe with International at 8% in US and Canada at 7%. Looking at Q4, revenue was 8%, which is a reacceleration from Q3. That signifies the 16th consecutive quarter of 6% or better underlying growth. US and Canada had a very good year with growth of 7% consistent with the full year underlying growth at '22 and '23 and for the fourth quarter 8%, which is supported by improvement in retention and lost as well as a better balance of recurring business. The US business also beginning to see some green shoots from deal activity from capital markets. However, we continue to see rate pressure on financial lines to offset that. International had a terrific year. Underlying growth of 8%, 4% in the quarter and consistently strong growth for EMEA, Latin America for both the full year and the quarter. APEC continues to show some signs of moderation with solid growth at 5%. We've got great talent in all the markets, we've been investing well, extremely well positioned for the future. So, we feel very good about that. So. Yes.
John Doyle: Perfect. Thank you. It was a strong finish. Alex, do you have a follow up?
Alex Scott: Yeah, I do. The other question I wanted to ask you all is on the potential for M&A, IPOs, et cetera, to have the environment improve more activity. As I think across your businesses, can you help us think through the different ways that that benefits you? And is there any way you can help us frame the kind of impact that that would have on organic growth if we do have a return of that kind of activity?
John Doyle: Yeah. We're not going to report out separately around M&A or IPO activity, but we have important capabilities across the firm. At Marsh, Mercer and Oliver Wyman in particular, of course, Guy Carpenter's almost entirely focused on the insurance industry, but we help with different levels of due diligence. We have a suite of products that can help facilitate transactions when there might be some terms that need to be settled between buyer and seller. So, it's an important capability set that we bring to our clients. And it's obviously an important moment when a company is selling itself or divesting of a business. And then, of course, on the buy side, meaningful investment. And so, those are important moments where we can really distinguish ourselves and show the overall strength of our company. So, it's an important capability. As we noted, we saw a pickup in M&A activity in the fourth quarter. We'll see with 2025 brings. I know a couple of IPOs have been out in the market, not sure ready to declare some giant IPO year in 2025, but we'll see. It's an important capability. We distribute through a range of investors. We stay close to our corporate clients, of course, and spend a lot of time with law firms as well, again to support our clients efforts to invest. Thank you, Alex. Andrew, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I had just a question more prospectively just on the market and obviously the wildfire is still very early days. But I'm wondering if you guys are seeing any impact on both the primary and reinsurance property markets and what your outlook is there given an over $30 billion insured loss.
John Doyle: Yeah. Thanks, David. Maybe I'll make a couple of comments and then I'll ask Dean and Martin to talk about what they're seeing in the market, which I think highlight is not a lot in terms of market impact at this point. But as I noted in my prepared remarks, just absolutely devastating events in Southern California. And our focus is on helping our colleagues and our clients recover. It's going to be a long road back and we're going to support them along the way. We're helping with relocation of families, beginning to think about claims prep and filing claims with insurers and then the rebuilding effort. I would say that our exposure as a business is primarily as an advisor to high-net-worth homeowners. So, it's a limited view in that perspective and not overall that impactful to Marsh McLennan from a financial perspective. But as a major risk advisor, we certainly have something to say about the future and efforts to build back with greater resilience. And I would say reading lots of comments about how to support the fair plan or how to create subsidies for insurance. Candidly, it's the wrong conversation. The conversation we should be having really is about building greater resilience into these communities rather than trying to find ways to subsidize insurance that will lead to happier homeowners and residents of Southern California and other cat prone areas over time. And, of course, that conversation isn't limited to Southern California. So important steps need to be taken so that we're not in the same place. This sad and devastating place again sometime soon. But with that, Dean, maybe you could talk about what you're seeing so far in the reinsurance market and then we'll have Martin comment on the insurance market.
Dean Klisura: Thanks, John. David, from a reinsurance perspective, as John noted, we're first and foremost committed to supporting our clients as they navigate the complexity of this loss. Guy Carpenter has formed a dedicated wildfire taskforce comprised of our best meteorologists, cat modelers, analytics, claims, colleagues, brokers. We're fully engaging with our clients, give them insights so they can better assess the magnitude of the loss. It's clear that many of our reinsurance clients will have losses resulting in claims to the reinsurance programs. As John noted, we've seen industry estimates expect the loss to exceed $30 billion, although we saw bigger numbers than that in the market yesterday being reported. The impact on the reinsurance market is uncertain at this time and will certainly depend on the ultimate magnitude of the reinsurance loss. But I would say, David, at this stage the risk adjusted rate reductions that we witnessed at January 1st could certainly be tempered moving forward as we go into the April 1st renewal season.
John Doyle: Thanks, Dean. Martin, any thoughts?
Martin South: Yeah. The overall rates came down 2% in the fourth quarter. You have to put that in context. It's focused on a large account segment and it's gone up one and a half times since 2012. We did see some rate decreases in property book in the last quarter and slowdown across the world. It's really too early to say what this impact is going to have. It's not a big commercial event for our clients. I think we're going to have to wait and see. And our focus is really on making sure that our colleagues, our clients, and we're providing the right advice for our high-net-worth clients as they think about resilience and building forward. So not market hysteria, that's for sure.
John Doyle: David, as you know, the California market was on -- homeowners market was under real stress before these events. And so, again, it just underscores just the critical need to build better resilience into these communities. Do you have a follow up?
David Motemaden: I do, yeah. And thanks for that answer. So, just switching gears to consulting and the health business within Mercer. Could you help me think through the underlying growth deceleration? I know the comp got a little bit more difficult, but I was surprised to see the 5% growth. I think it's the lowest it's been since 2021. And I know John, you mentioned health costs still increasing. I think it was 11% was the expectation in '25. So, could you help me think through the deceleration there, and how you guys are thinking about growth as we go into '25?
John Doyle: Sure, David. I'll ask Pat to comment in a second. I would say we're not necessarily exposed directly to those cost increases that I spoke about in my prepared remarks. So, it was mostly raising those issues just around the critical nature of the advice that we provide to employers where you have employer sponsored care or maybe supplemental care in other markets around the world outside of the United States. Obviously, inflation and broader cost increases are a real source of stress for employers around the world and for economies as well. And so, again, it just underscores the critical nature of the advice we provide. So Pat, maybe you could talk about the results in '24 and a little bit of our outlook in health.
Pat Tomlinson: Sure. And thanks for the question. Listen overall for Mercer, I just want to start that we're pleased with our Q4 underlying growth of 5%. It's our 15th consecutive quarter with 5% or more growth and also really pleased that all the practices are contributing to that growth. Full year results of 5% I think highlights the resilience and the consistency of our business during uncertain and volatile times, and really underscores the continued relevance that we have in our solutions in helping our clients. Now specifically on the health, health grew 5% in the fourth quarter as you highlight 8% for the full year. I would say the performance was broad-based across regions and it comes from a few different things. Our continued hiring in new talent, our focus on thought leadership, John highlighted a few of the pieces during his opening around our national survey of employer sponsored health plans, our 2025 health trends report, our people risk survey. We've also been expanding the digital tools. We're now in 102 countries with those digital tools and we've got a real focus on client segmentation to go ahead and make sure that we can match client healthcare needs with the innovative and tailored solutions we have based on large market, mid-market global multinationals. We think we continue to see some tailwinds from continued high employment rates, regulatory changes and then, obviously, medical cost inflation. All of which drives clients' focus on affordability and access to quality healthcare for the [Technical Difficulty]. And I think collaboration as we've talked about before across the firm continues to support our growth momentum. Now from the quarter, I would say we can have some variability in any given quarter including one-offs in timing, but we believe our full year growth is much more reflective of our performance, right, which was the 8% that I talked about. I think we maintain a positive outlook and anticipate our growth momentum will continue due to the strong value proposition we offer clients and that we have the thought leadership, the strong ongoing demand. John mentioned the various different pieces of our business in his tee up just now. Absolutely. Higher medical inflation drives up health and benefits costs for employers. Right? So, absolutely. Employers are facing elevated prices combined with structural industry obstacles like labor shortages, like health system consolidation. And we definitely see continued demand for health expertise. But globally our health revenue does have a balance of fixed fee and commission work. So, I would say generally speaking, we don't directly see the full impact of inflation and that medical inflation that John was talking about on our revenue either when it's in periods of high like it's been in the last couple of years, or in periods of low. But at the same point, while not necessarily directly through higher commissions, higher medical costs and higher medical inflation absolutely drives client demand as we think about how we have to do fee-based plan design work and projects to try and help clients mitigate that cost escalation and the impact on their clients and on their colleagues.
John Doyle: Thanks, Pat. And I would note that Oliver Wyman does a lot of important work in the industry as well. So, thank you David, for the questions. Andrew, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James.
Greg Peters: Good morning, everyone. Can I go back to the comments on McGriff? I think you mentioned $450 million to $500 million in total retention incentives that are going to be somehow flowing through or recaptured. I guess, the reason why I'm triggered by this as I look at your income statement, I see the $60 million of acquisition retention related costs that go into the adjustments. So, just trying to map out what I should think about in terms of the adjustments as I think about '25.
John Doyle: Yeah. Sure, Greg. I'll ask Mark to jump in for a second. But, of course, retention is a critical part of any acquisitions we do. And we had a meaningful seller funded retention plan that was put in place to help our transaction work here. But Mark, maybe you could talk on the cost specifics.
Mark McGivney: So, as I said, we expect $450 million to $500 million of noteworthy charges in total over the next three years. And even though retention isn't -- it's not solely retention that'll be the biggest chunk of it. What you're seeing come through in the fourth quarter is actually that -- you might have heard me mention $26 million of just bridge financing costs and then the beginnings of starting to amortize those retentions. And it is important to recognize that a healthy amount of that retention was put in place by the seller and was funded through a purchase price adjustment. But it has to be amortized and flow through our financial statements. That's why we'll consider it noteworthy.
John Doyle: Thanks, Mark. Greg, do you have a follow up?
Greg Peters: I do. Just keeping in the adjustment category. For the full year, I think you recorded $148 million of restructuring charges. That's risk and insurance, total 276. Is the restructuring charges that we think about for '25, is it going to be exclusive or independent of what's going on in McGriff and what kind -- what are you expecting in terms of restructuring charges in '25?
John Doyle: Sure. Yeah. '24 was -- as Mark noted, we wrapped up our restructuring program. I talked about it a bit as well. But Mark, maybe you could share outlook in '25.
Mark McGivney: So, as we said, we're really happy with the execution of the restructuring program we started back in 2022 and it's a big driver of the margin expansion that we've seen and definitely contributed to our earnings growth. But it is -- that program is exceptionally closed at this point. So, the remaining charges were in the fourth quarter. So, as you look forward, the largest -- our expectation at this point is the largest piece of noteworthy items coming through will be related to McGriff. I mean, from time to time we'll have things like true ups to earn outs and some other stuff that'll go through there. But in terms of major programs, it's really McGriff at this point.
Greg Peters: Thank you.
John Doyle: Thanks, Greg. Appreciate the questions. Andrew, we're ready for our next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.
Michael Zaremski: Hey, morning. Going back to the organic or just mid-single-digit growth commentary that you made, John, in the prepared remarks, I know I heard your answer to Jimmy was don't read into it. But I guess we're analysts, we're going to try to read into it still. The last few years at least you said mid-single-digit or greater. So, is it -- is there did something maybe change in the planning process for '25 that we'll see in a proxy or I guess just also like now you told us the Marsh index, pricing index is down too. And so, I'm assuming there's some right sensitivity to your revenues from it being kind of a softish market for a while in the large account marketplace. So maybe that's kind of playing into your prepared remarks.
John Doyle: Yeah. No, thanks, Mike. I appreciate the question. Look, I think where we're most exposed to P&C pricing is in the middle market and middle market pricing tends to be more stable. So, I certainly -- your attempt to read into that, I don't think that's a major factor. The primary issue is FID. Right? And so, it's an uncertain outlook. Mark shared some insights on what we thought the first quarter headwinds would be like. We'll see from here. Obviously, inflation has remained stickier than most central banks would like, certainly here in the United States. But I think there's some volatility -- with potential volatility from some of the steps that the new administration is taking around trade and tariffs. And we'll see what that means. Right? But FID really is the primary driver.
Michael Zaremski: Got it. And quick follow up also on -- probably for Mark on capital. So, the $4.5 billion of deploy guide for '25 and no change year-over-year. I'm assuming most of that is just due to charges to integrate McGriff or are there other material moving pieces we should be thinking about?
Mark McGivney: So, the outlook for capital deployment, I think is what you're asking about $4.5 billion, we're really happy with that outlook. If you think back to last year, we spent close to $12 billion and we had built up a significant amount of flexibility and that was certainly a lot more than we had planned coming into the year. But to be looking at a year, having done all of that and be looking at a year in 2025, that's a normal year of capital deployment and have still a lot of flexibility to do M&A, pay dividends and buy back stock is just a great position to be in. So, we feel really good about where we are.
John Doyle: Largest deal in our history in McGriff, two top 100 agencies, Cardano, Vanguard's OCIO business. And we've got $4.5 billion to deploy. So, yeah, I mean it speaks to the cash flow generation of the company and the strength of our franchise. I would add that we're quite active in the market too, the M&A market, I mean, and we have a great brand and reputation in that market and that's important in people businesses. Of course, we do have the ability to do bigger deals if the right deal presents itself. I think we're more likely to continue our string of pearls strategy that's served us so well and we're likely to bring our leverage back down. But Mark and I both talked about we want to retain the flexibility to strike when it makes sense. Thank you, Mike. Andrew, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Great. Thanks, and good morning. John, I want to follow up on the point that you just made. Does the effort required to integrate McGriff impede the ability to do big deals in the United States, either overall or with an MMA.
John Doyle: I'm not sure I understand. Impede for what reason? What do you mean?
Meyer Shields: Just management effort in the…
John Doyle: Well, look, again, these are people, businesses, right? So, there's no question, social issues are important. That's why I highlighted our reputation of really doing what we say we're going to do when we're getting to know businesses and talking about what the possibilities are when we come together as an organization. So, there's always going to be a capacity -- some level of capacity constraint around management time and attention. And, of course, we won't make any big mistakes either. We've been very, very successful and have been a consolidator for much of our 150-year-plus history. And so -- but again, we're more likely to continue our string of pearls strategy, Meyer, but we do have the ability to do something bigger. There's no question. At MMA, Dave and his team have obviously a lot of experience in doing this. And I would also note we're not meeting these target firms for the first time when we're welcoming them to the family. So, we work on many of these deals for many, many years. Do you have a follow up, Meyer?
Meyer Shields: Yeah. Just a quick one. Mark mentioned that there was a difficult organic growth comp coming up and I just wanted to dig in a little bit. I know other brokers have talked about that as well. Was there something in last year's first quarter revenues that are less recurring than the typical book?
John Doyle: No, no, not at all. We just -- we have some unusual headwinds in the first quarter, FX, tax. We've got some of the seasonality that Mark mentioned around McGriff's revenue in the first quarter being a bit seasonally light. We do have some FID headwinds as well, but we're planning on that to persist throughout the full year. So anyway, no, nothing unusual about prior year's first quarter. All those things. And a bit of a tougher comp in the first quarter.
Meyer Shields: Okay, perfect. Thank you.
John Doyle: Thank you, Meyer. Andrew, another question please.
Operator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs.
Rob Cox: Hey, thanks. Good morning. My first question was a bit of a bigger picture question for you, John. A large insurer recently highlighted a secular shift in the small and middle market where more premiums are flowing to a smaller number of middle market insurers, kind of based on their scale and data and analytics advantages. I'm curious if you agree with that trend and if you could talk about what that trend means for Marsh growth opportunities.
John Doyle: I'm not sure I'm familiar with those comments, so I want to be careful about commenting on what somebody else might say about the middle market. Do I think scale matters? Yes, I think scale matters in our business. I think it matters to intermediaries and I think it matters to underwriters. There's no question, data matters. The ability to develop broader insights. And then, of course, having diversification of risk on both the asset and liability side of a balance sheet, all of those things matter. So, we do. We are through Marsh, I guess if your comment -- question was about the middle market, maybe in the United States, we originate more risk than just about anybody, certainly on a global basis. And as we talked about in the middle market, MMA will be on a standalone basis, the fifth largest broker out there. Our ability to trade with some of the larger insurers there. Yeah, we have terrific relationships and they bring innovative solutions to the middle market. I commented really in the context of McGriff. One of the things that we find so attractive about the middle market is our ability to bring scale benefits to that segment of the market and that matters to that customer base. And so, to the extent an insurer can bring similar scale benefits, yeah, it matters. Do you have a follow up, Rob?
Rob Cox: Yeah. And just for clarification, I mean, I think the comments were meant to imply that more market share is going to larger insurers. And I would think that that might be a benefit for Marsh as you have relationships with those larger insurers.
John Doyle: Got it, got it. Thank you. Do you have a follow up, Rob?
Rob Cox: Yeah. The follow up, appreciate no specific guidance on McGriff margins, but I was hoping you could give us some rough insight into whether you expect the acquisition to be directionally additive or dilutive to margins in 2025, and if you think there's an above average opportunity to expand those McGriff margins over time.
John Doyle: Yeah. I think we mentioned this in last quarter. McGriff really was a carve out of a carve out. So, the possibilities around McGriff are not built around meaningful expense synergies, just to be clear. But as I mentioned earlier, scale matters not just to our clients, it matters for our colleagues because we can give them tools and data and insights and technology that others can't. And it matters to our shareholders as well. So, we expect to bring scale benefits to all three. And we're excited about what McGriff will mean to adjusted EPS later in '25 and into '26 and '27.
End of Q&A:
John Doyle: So, thank you, Rob. With that, Andrew, we've got to wrap up. We're past the bottom of the hour. Thank you. I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning. And I also want to thank our colleagues for their hard work and their dedication. I also want to thank all of our clients for their continued support and confidence in Marsh McLennan. Thanks again to everyone, and we look forward to speaking with you all again next quarter. Thank you, Andrew.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-17 08:00:00) =====

[Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.
John Doyle: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. On the call with me is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Pat Tomlinson of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning for her last quarter as Head of Investor Relations is Sarah DeWitt. We’d like to congratulate Sarah on her new role as Chief Financial Officer of Marsh. Before I get into our results, I’d like to take a moment to comment on Hurricane Helene and Milton, which have devasted communities in Florida and the Southeast United States. These events are first and foremost the human tragedy and our thoughts are with all of those impacted by the storms. Our primary concern has been the wellbeing of our colleagues and their families as well as our clients and we’re actively working to assist in their recovery. While the ultimate insured loss won’t be known for sometime the impact of these storms will be significant and given their wide paths of destruction and close timing they will put enormous pressure on resources available for recovery. Both hurricanes also highlight the meaningful disparity between economic loss and insured loss. According to some estimates, Helene may have the largest multiple of economic to insured loss of any U.S. storm. This protection gap imposes a meaningful burden on the economy, makes near-term recovery more challenging and undercuts resilience. In addition, rising frequency and severity of extreme weather events, higher property values and increased development in cat prone areas are driving the need for greater protection. We and the insurance industry help communities, businesses and governments build resilience to manage these perils. But as these storms highlight, there is opportunity to do more through risk mitigation, event preparedness and alternative solutions such as community based parametric products. Turning to our results, the third quarter marked another milestone for Marsh McLennan. We continue to perform well across our business and we were thrilled to announce the acquisition of McGriff Insurance Services. In the quarter, we generated 5% underlying revenue growth following 10% in the third of last year, reflecting solid execution in RIS and Consulting. We grew adjusted operating income 12%. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points, adjusted EPS grew 4% or 11%, excluding a discrete tax benefit in the Q3 of last year and we completed $300 million of share repurchases in the quarter. Turning to McGriff, it is a leading provider of insurance broking and risk management services in the U.S. with approximately $1.3 billion in revenue. I have long admired McGriff. They have excellent leadership, talented colleagues and a track record of strong growth. Their deep specialty and industry capabilities will strengthen the value proposition and expand the reach of Marsh McLennan Agency in the vast and growing middle market segment. McGriff's client focus, culture of collaboration and commitment to excellence and integrity mirror our own. Together, McGriff and MMA will create new opportunities for colleagues to be their best and helping them delivers even greater value to clients. The $7.75 billion transaction will be funded by cash on hand and debt financing. We expect to close by year end, subject to regulatory approval. We would also expect the transaction to be modestly accretive to adjusted EPS, excluding amortization in year one and become more meaningfully accretive in year two and beyond. We have a terrific track record of acquiring and integrating businesses and we are excited to welcome McGriff's over 3,500 colleagues to the company when the deal closes. McGriff has added to what is already an active year for M&A across our business. We are on track record for the largest M&A year in Marsh McLennan's history, with nearly $10 billion of capital committed to acquisitions year to date, including McGriff, Vanguard's U.S. OCIO business, Cardano, Horton and FBBI. These acquisitions highlight our strategy to deploy capital to faster growing segments of our business. As we have said before, we consistently focus on delivering in the near-term, while investing for sustained growth over the long-term. Shifting to the macro environment, the overall backdrop remains supportive of growth despite what continues to be a complex and volatile landscape. Central banks have begun a cycle of easing and consensus views of the likelihood of near-term recession for most major economies are well below where they were coming into the year. We continue to see economic growth across most of our major markets. Inflation remains elevated, but declining. Labor markets remain healthy and the cost of risk in healthcare continues to rise. That said, uncertainty remains with rising geopolitical tensions and continuing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Clients across the world continue to assess the implications of technology advances in AI, the ever persistent threat from cyber-attacks, supply chain risk and the impact of increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events on their businesses. Our talent, expertise and solutions help clients manage challenges and accelerate opportunities to thrive, so we remain positive in our outlook for growth. We are well positioned and have a track record of performing across economic cycles due to the enduring value we bring to clients and the resilience of our business. Turning to insurance and reinsurance market conditions, the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index was down 1% overall in the third quarter versus flat in the second quarter. Rates in the U.S. and Latin America were up low-single-digits. Europe was flat, and in the UK, Asia and Pacific rates were down mid-single-digits. Global property rates were down 2% versus flat in the second quarter, however, global casualty rates increased 6% with U.S. excess casualty up approximately 20% in the quarter. Workers' compensation decreased low-single-digits. Global financial and professional liability rates were down 7%, while cyber decreased 6%. In reinsurance, demand continued to rise and capacity remained adequate in the quarter. While it is too early to know the ultimate insured losses from hurricanes Helene and Milton, we expect there to be an impact on 2025 property insurance and reinsurance pricing. Cat bonds, which posted record volume in the first half, remain likely to have elevated issuance activity through year end, driven by a heavy maturity schedule and capacity for casualty programs is expected to be adequate despite concerns over the pace of lost cost inflation. As always, we are helping clients navigate these dynamic market conditions. Now, let me turn to our third quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.63, which is up 4% from a year ago or 11%, excluding a $0.10 discrete tax benefit in the third quarter of last year. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 5%. Underlying revenue grew 6% in RIS and 4% in consulting. Marsh was up 7%. Guy Carpenter 7%, Mercer 5% and Oliver Wyman grew 1%. Overall in the third quarter, adjusted operating income grew 12% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points year-over-year. For the nine months, consolidated revenue grew 7% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 12%, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $6.93, up 10% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, we are well positioned for another great year in 2024. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth, another year of margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Our outlook assumes current macro conditions persist. However, the environment remains uncertain and the economic backdrop could be materially different than our assumptions. Overall, I'm pleased with our Q3 performance, which demonstrates execution of our strategy and continued momentum across our business. I'm grateful to our colleagues for their focus and determination and the value they deliver to our clients, shareholders and communities. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, John, and good morning. Our momentum continued in the Q3, with solid underlying revenue growth, significant margin expansion and 4% growth in adjusted EPS or 11% excluding a large discrete tax benefit last year. Our consolidated revenue increased 6% to $5.7 billion with underlying growth of 5%. Operating income was $1.1 billion and adjusted operating income was $1.2 billion up 12%. Our adjusted operating margin increased 110 basis points to 22.4%. GAAP EPS was $1.51 adjusted EPS was $1.63. For the first nine months, underlying revenue growth was 7%, adjusted operating income grew 12% to $4.9 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 110 basis points to 28% and adjusted EPS increased 10% to $6.93. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue was $3.5 billion, up 8% from a year ago or 6% on an underlying basis. This result marks the 15th consecutive quarter of 6% or higher underlying growth in RIS and continues the best stretch of growth in two decades. Note that fiduciary income was $138 million in the quarter and looking ahead to the Q4, we expect to see this amount decline by approximately $30 million reflecting recent rate cuts and a seasonal drop in fiduciary assets. Operating income in RIS increased 15% to $733 million. Adjusted operating income increased 16% to $775 million and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 24.7%. For the first nine months, revenue in RIS was $11.7 billion underlying growth of 8%. Adjusted operating income increased 12% to $3.7 billion and margin increased 100 basis points to 33.6%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.9 billion, up 9% from a year ago or 7% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 8% growth in the Q3 of last year. Growth in the Q3 was broad based and reflected solid retention and new business growth. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 6% for the quarter led by strong growth in MMA and in Victor, our MGA business. In international, underlying growth was 7% and comes on top of 10% in the Q3 of last year. Latin America was up 8%, EMEA was up 7% and Asia Pacific was up 5%. First nine months of the year, Marsh's revenue was $9.2 billion with underlying growth of 7%. U.S. and Canada grew 7% and international was up 7%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $381 million in the quarter, up 6% or 7% on an underlying basis, driven by strong growth in international including global specialties. For the first nine months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated $2.2 billion of revenue and 8% underlying growth. In the consulting segment third quarter revenue was $2.3 billion, up 3% from a year ago or 4% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $462 million and adjusted operating income was $478 million, up 7%. Our adjusted operating margin in consulting was 21.7% in the third quarter, an increase of 90 basis points. The first nine months consulting revenue was $6.7 billion with underlying growth of 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $1.3 billion and our adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points to 20.7%. Mercer's revenue was $1.5 billion in the quarter, up 5% on an underlying basis. This was Mercer's 14th consecutive quarter of 5% or higher underlying growth. Health underlying growth remains strong at 8% and reflected growth across all regions. Career grew 5%, where we saw strong growth in rewards and talent strategy. Wealth grew 4% driven by continued demand and defined benefits consulting and growth and investment management. Our assets under management at the end of the third quarter rose to $548 billion, up significantly from the third quarter of last year and up 11% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven by the impact of capital markets, our transaction with Vanguard and positive net flows. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $4.3 billion with 6% underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $810 million, up 1% on an underlying basis. This reflects a tough comparison to 12% growth in the third quarter of last year and softness in certain geographies. We currently see this trend extending into the fourth quarter. The first nine months of the year revenue at Oliver Wyman was $2.4 billion, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis. Foreign exchange had very little impact on earnings in the third quarter, assuming exchange rates remain at current levels we also expect minimal FX impact in the fourth quarter. Total noteworthy items in the quarter were $78 million. These included $54 million of restructuring costs mostly related to the program we began in the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as some transaction related charges. Our other net benefit credit was $68 million in the quarter. For the full year 2024 we expect our other net benefit credit will be about $270 million. Interest expense in the third quarter was $154 million, up from $145 million in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting higher levels of debt and higher interest rates. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $151 million of interest expense in the fourth quarter, excluding any amounts related to the McGriff transaction. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 26.7% compared with 20.5% in the third quarter of last year. Our tax rate last year included the release of evaluation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets. Excluding discrete items our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 26.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 26.5% for 2024. Turning to our McGriff transaction. McGriff is a terrific company with excellent leadership, a culture similar to MMA's, a diversified business mix, presence in faster growing U.S. markets and a strong track record of performance. We will be paying $7.75 billion in cash consideration, funded by a combination of cash on hand and new debt and we expect to close by year end subject to regulatory approval. As part of the transaction, we expect to assume a deferred tax asset valued at approximately $500 million. As we've noted in the past, we maintain considerable balance sheet flexibility to position us for this type of opportunity. We've secured a committed bridge loan facility for the full amount of the purchase price and currently plan to replace these commitments with permanent financing in the Q4 as we get closer to closing. Based on our outlook today, we expect to raise $7.25 billion in new debt to fund the transaction. We value our high quality ratings and we were pleased that all three rating agencies recently affirmed our current ratings with no changes in outlook. The financial and capital management plan contemplated in the transaction is not only consistent with maintaining our current ratings, but we also expect to have meaningful flexibility for capital deployment next year. Although initially our leverage ratios will increase, the substantial cash flow we expect to generate as well as increased debt capacity through earnings growth will enable us to bring our leverage ratios back in line with levels necessary to maintain a strong ratings profile. As a result, while we intend to pause share repurchases in the fourth quarter, as we think about capital management into next year, we expect we will maintain our balanced approach that includes increasing our dividend and reducing our share count each year as well as continuing to fund high quality acquisitions. We will obviously have more guidance around our outlook for capital deployment in 2025 on our Q4 earnings call early next year. As John noted, we expect the transaction will be modestly accretive to adjusted EPS excluding amortization in year one becoming more meaningfully accretive in year two and beyond. This transaction is a great reflection of several elements of our capital management strategy, maintaining flexibility to take advantage of opportunities, a bias to reinvest capital for growth and delivering in the near-term, while challenging ourselves to invest to sustain growth into the future. Earnings capital management and our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total debt of $12.8 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in the first of 2025, when $500 million of senior notes mature. We currently expect to deploy approximately $4.2 billion of capital in 2024 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases excluding the McGriff transaction. Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $1.8 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1.1 billion and included $404 million for dividends, $435 million for acquisitions and $300 million for share repurchases. For the first nine months, uses of cash totaled $3.3 billion included $1.1 billion for dividends, $1.3 billion for acquisitions and $900 million for share repurchases. I want to spend a minute on our plans to change how we report adjusted EPS. Starting next year, we will exclude the impact of acquisition related amortization from adjusted EPS. We will also exclude the other net benefit credit, another non-cash item. These changes will improve the comparability of our results and give investors a better sense of our core earnings power. They will also conform our adjusted EPS reporting with how we report adjusted operating margins. While there continues to be uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy, we feel good about the momentum in our business and the current environment remains supportive of growth. Overall, we are well positioned for another great year in 2024. Based on our outlook today for the full year, we continue to expect mid-single digit or better underlying growth, margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to John.
John Doyle: Thank you, Mark. Andrew, we're ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question. And our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: My first question is on the McGriff deal, when you guys say right, that you expect it’s accretive to earnings less intangibles, what are your -- can you give us some color on what your assumptions are for revenue growth relative to the $1.3 billion that you're taking on? And then also what are you assuming for margin, I guess my questions for the year one guide, but any guide you kind of want to give us for year two and beyond would be helpful as well.
John Doyle: I just want to reiterate how excited we are to bring welcome McGriff into the family. Obviously, it is subject to regulatory approval, they have a really strong culture. It's a competitive group, they're so client focused. I spoke to the talent in my prepared remarks and they'll extend our reach into, it's a vast and fragmented middle market. They have excellent specialty capabilities and industry focus. And working together with MMA, we know they can drive better outcomes for clients and we can create new opportunities for their colleagues as well. So we're excited about all that. We've shared the details that we're going to share about the business, like other MMA transactions, we don't disclose their margins when we acquire them or for that matter how they're growing or -- but we're excited about it. As I said, it'll be modestly accretive in year one. And more so, after that and we expect to earn a good return on the investment over time. So there are synergies of course, but we're conservative in our modeling and we're very excited about what the combination can mean.
Elyse Greenspan: And then my follow up on U.S. and Canada growth was 6% again this quarter. Can you just give us a sense of some of the dynamics that you're seeing within that market and then relative to like the IPO and SPAC in that business, right? That's been a headwind for a couple years. Have you seen any improvement there in the quarter?
John Doyle: Sure. I'd start Elyse just with overall I'm very pleased with our underlying growth in the quarter. I thought we had a terrific quarter. Marsh, Guy Carpenter and Mercer all had terrific growth. And it was really widespread. It was across all regions and practices and so we felt good about that. We obviously had a softer quarter of growth at Oliver Wyman. But overall, I thought the growth was good and we're well positioned. I spoke to the macro environment, it is shifting and changing. And obviously, interest rates have begun to come down in some major economies around the world and that's meant some new opportunity in SPACs and IPOs and well, maybe not SPACs, but IPOs and M&A activity, we're starting to pick up a bit. But Martin, maybe you could talk a little bit about the U.S. marketplace and some of the opportunities we're seeing.
Martin South : Sure, John. As you said, very pleased with underlying growth of 7%, which is kind of in line with 8% in 3Q '23 and 3Q '22, very good balance of growth across international and in the U.S., but I'll double-click a little bit on the U.S. performed very well, 6% on top of 6% in Q3. We saw very good growth from MMA and Vector. And to Elyse’s question, we did see double-digit growth in the capital markets and MMA products. Construction & Aviation performed well and globally, very strong growth in our benefits business as well. So overall, pleased with that good momentum and expect that to continue.
John Doyle : Double-digit growth at least in capital markets, of course, is off a lower base, right, after a couple of years of a soft environment there. So thank you for your questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.
Jimmy Bhullar : So first, I just had a question following up on your comments on Milton and its impact on the market. So, just specifically on reinsurance. Just wondering what your expectations are on how Milton affects renewals? And should one assume that prices could actually go up or they're just going to go down given the high loss.
John Doyle : Yes. I think, Jimmy, at the end of the day, it's too early to know that at this point. There's obviously a range of estimates out there and the ranges are quite wide. And so there's still a lot for us to learn, many property owners are just getting to their facilities at this point. And so, I spoke about the overall economic impact to the Southeast and what it means to those communities at a human level as well, it's going to be a challenging recovery and it's going to extend for a bit of period of time. Maybe I could ask Dean to comment a little bit about where we're expecting in advance of those storms? And any thoughts he has on the impact it might have. Dean?
Dean Klisura : Yes. Thanks, John. And Jimmy, as we entered the kind of fall conference season ahead of Helen and Milton, I think our clients and we anticipated a very competitive market environment at the upcoming January 1 property cat renewal. I think post Milton, it's still early, but I think we see a flattening of pricing in the property cat market at the upcoming January 1 renewal. If you think about kind of lower and mid-level layers and programs, we kind of see risk -adjusted flattish at this point without all the data in, and you could still see some softening, some rate reductions in more remote risk layers and property cat towers. As John said, keep in mind, it's early. We're still in wind season. There could be additional cat events over the next several weeks that would shape the market. And as John noted, it will be several weeks before we have sufficient claims data to make accurate loss estimates and those impacts on our clients. And right now, we're just relying on all of our cat modeling partners to come up with some of those estimates. But to sum it up, Jimmy, I would say, overall, property cat demand should increase at January 1 from our clients. We think capacity in the marketplace will be adequate. We think the renewal will be manageable for most of our clients. The market is well capitalized to trade forward and meets client demand. And keep in mind, I think the headline, Jimmy, is the major of the cat losses this year will be borne by our clients given the high attachment points that were imposed on that after Hurricane Ian two years ago.
John Doyle : Thank you Dean. Jimmy, do you have a follow-up?
Jimmy Bhullar : Just on Oliver Wyman. Obviously, the comps were tough as well, but you noted seeing weakness in some geographic regions. Was that a function of the economy? Or is there something else that's affecting results in the areas that you mentioned.
John Doyle : Yes, sure. 1%, obviously, underlying was softer than we'd planned for. It was a tough comp and we're up 5% year-to-date. And what I would also say is, I mentioned to you in the past, there's going to be more volatility quarter-to-quarter at Oliver Wyman. We do expect higher underlying revenue growth from Oliver Wyman over the medium- to long-term. But Nick, maybe you could share some insights on what you're seeing in the market.
Nick Studer : Thank you, Jimmy. We often say this is a mid- to high-single-digit business through the cycle. And I think it's fair to say we're at a low point in the cycle. And we've talked for a few quarters now about that being a tough market and we do see that continuing. Maybe at a macro level, I'd just note, we're more than 50% larger than we were pre-pandemic. We're 2/3 larger than that pandemic year. And I think we are consolidating those gains in that tough market. But for the quarter itself, no one likes a one, no one likes a one following a three. They were at 12 and 11 comp. Thank you for noting that in the question. When we look at the year as a whole, we're five, I think I do want to note we're on the front foot inorganically as well because there are parts of our business where scale does matter. And so the business is 8% larger than in the same periods first three quarters of last year. And that represents a form of progress. We've seen very strong growth in Asia and the Pacific region, bouncing back from a tougher period, our India, Middle East and Africa business continues to grow. The regional softness has been more in the Americas and in Europe. I think some of that is linked to the economy, but also just corporate buying habits given uncertainty in the Americas, maybe in the U.S., particularly some waiting for the election. Sector-wise, our best growth has been in our communications, media and technology practice. Our insurance and asset management practice growing very strongly. Automotive and manufacturing doing well and our large banking practice continuing to be pretty robust. But overall, we see it as being a relatively tough market, which we'll continue to work our way through.
John Doyle : Thank you, Jimmy for your questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James.
Greg Peters : I guess for my first question, I'd like to focus on the free cash flow results. I was looking in the statement of cash flows, operating cash flow through the nine months, down a little bit, not growing in line with revenue. And just -- I'm sure there's some puts and takes in there. Just some color there would be helpful.
John Doyle : Yes. Sure, Greg. As we've noted in the past, there's going to be more volatility to free cash flow growth, certainly than our earnings growth. But Mark, maybe you could share some color.
Mark McGivney : Yes, just I'll repeat that John. We -- free cash flow is something that is volatile quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. So best looked at over long stretches of time. Our track record in free cash flow growth, as we've noted before has been terrific. So we're a double-digit free cash flow growth for a decade plus. And that's what you'd expect for a company that's grown its EPS double-digits given our high cash generation capital type model. There's no story in the results year-to-date. So free cash flow is down. Year-to-date was up 28% last year. It was actually up in the third quarter. So what you're seeing year-to-date is just a number of factors that caused this period-to-period volatility. So we had higher variable compensation payouts in the first quarter because of our strong results last year. Receivables are up because of growth and it's just a little bit of business mix and timing. And there's just a handful of one-timers in last year's period, this period that affect the year-over-year comparison. So overall, we have an outlook for continued strong growth in earnings, and therefore, our free cash flow growth into the future should be strong as well.
John Doyle : Thanks Mark. Greg, do you have a follow-up?
Greg Peters : Yes. Mark, in your comments, I think you mentioned something about fiduciary income and interest income and you provided some guidance. And I'm wondering if you could just -- you guys are flying through so many comments. If you could just revisit those comments and sort of -- I think you're framing it for fourth quarter. And if we could push it out and sort of frame it for next year or two for us would be helpful.
Mark McGivney : Yes, sure. Let me repeat what I said. We did have a lot in the script this quarter. So we just wanted to flag that as we look into the fourth quarter, we typically see, especially in Guy Carpenter, just given the seasonality of their revenue with so much activity in the first half, we do see fiduciary balances that tend to fall off in the fourth quarter. So we do expect fiduciary income to be $30 million or so lower in the fourth quarter from the level we saw in the third quarter. And it's a combination of the rate cuts that have happened and the impact that they will have as well as the seasonal drop in fiduciary balances. We look out to 2025, it's really going to depend on what rate actions happen from here. What happens in the balance of this year, what happens since the next year. And so we're going to stay away from speculating there, but just to repeat some of the things we've said in the past. The math is pretty straightforward. So we've got roughly $11.5 billion of balances on average these days. And so you can use that as a basis to try to do some sensitivity analysis around what that could mean to fiduciary income. There would be some offsets. There are -- there is some interplay with some of our variable compensation programs. We obviously would pay less in terms of interest on short-term debt. But we'll just have to wait and see what happens with further cuts as we look into next year.
John Doyle : Greg, I would just add, we're accustomed to operating in a lower rate environment. So we'll adjust our plans accordingly. I will likely be an increasing headwind for us into 2025. And we model out the various scenarios, not just from this headwind but from other headwinds as well. And so we make plans accordingly. But a lower rate environment could also or likely will impact other parts of our business as well. We touched on increasing transaction risk as a result of higher volume in M&A markets, IPOs, construction, Mercer Wealth, of course, overall, our cost of capital will be impacted as well. So there'll be lots of ins and outs from a lower rate environment and we're working our way through all those issues.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.
Mike Zaremski : First question on the -- thanks for the update on the Marsh pricing index, which moved to negative 1 territory, I believe. Can you help tease out how this index and kind of pricing in this marketplace is having an impact on Marsh's organic growth? I know that there's an element of fees and then commissions as well. But is this -- is the index as it's decelerated in the last year or so, has it had any material impact on your Marsh's rate of organic growth?
John Doyle : Look, first of all, Mike, what I would say is that the markets overall, on average are stable. Insurers have picked up quite a bit of price over the course of the last several years. So minus 1 was some welcome relief, at least for many of our clients at Marsh after what's been a tough pricing environment. Of course, price is ultimately a reflection of the cost of risk over time. And so as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the cost of risk continues to escalate. About half of our business at Marsh is sensitive to our revenue. That is a sensitive to P&C pricing through commission. The rest of it, of course, is on a fee. And it's not a direct line. You have buying habits change as markets soften a bit and the risk environment changes. You may have clients retain less risk than they had over the course of the last few years. We've talked on prior calls, for example, about the growth in our captives business, the premium and the captives that we manage have been growing faster than the premiums that we see into the marketplace. If the market continues to get a bit more competitive, that may change. So obviously, it has an impact, but it's not a straight line from price. What I would also point out to you is that our index is skewed to large accounts and that the middle market pricing is more stable and it's up low to mid-single digits. I hope that's helpful. Do you have a follow-up?
Mike Zaremski : Yes, a quick follow-up. I'll stick with your pricing commentary. Hopefully, other people asked about Mercer Health being strong. But so U.S., I believe, you said was plus 20, that's a pretty big number. Maybe you can talk about whether there's dislocation in that marketplace? Or what's going on? Is it going to be moved to the E&S market? Or maybe that's not even in maybe just anything -- any color you could add that seems like that's a number that's distressed for certain some of your clients.
John Doyle : Yes. I'm sure, Mike, on the last call, in fact, I talked about some real troubling signs in the U.S. liability market. Maybe I'll ask Martin to share some insights on what we're seeing in that marketplace.
MartinSouth : Yes. Thank you, John I'll just start with a comment that overall, the composite rating index is up about 1.5x since 2012. The casualty book is up 6% in North America with the excess book up 21%. At the moment, we're not seeing dislocations in that the capacity that clients are requesting we can place, there are smaller limits that insurers have and we're doing jobs to think what we can do to place quota share programs for our clients to avoid compression of limits. And so we don't see anything too sinister in terms of supply for clients at this point. Certainly, there's been a movement to the E&S market and we're big players in that space. And that segment of the market has grown significantly. There's more agility and rate movement in those areas there. So we're well positioned to help them with that and we're continuing to work with them as our clients deal with some of the social inflation that we've talked about in the past as well. So lots of other services that we need to wrap around that to help our clients navigate this market.
John Doyle : Thank you, Mike, and thank you, Martin.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith : First one for Dean on the reinsurance side. You mentioned that you expect ample capacity in the casualty lines. I'm just curious, can you maybe talk a little bit about how are the reinsurers do you think going to be reacting to this tort inflation that we continue to see in the marketplace at 1/1? Do you think -- we'll see a lot of tightening in terms and conditions. What are you hearing? What are you seeing from them?
John Doyle : Yes. Thanks, Brian. I'll hand it to Dean in a second, but loss cost inflation in casualty lines remains a real challenge for the marketplace overall and we're concerned about it from our clients' perspective and was the talk of conference season, I think in advance of Helene and Milton. So Dean, maybe you could share some thoughts on what you're seeing in reinsurance casualty.
Dean Klisura : Yes. Thanks, John. And Brian, as John said, I think reinsurers generally continue to express great concern about the U.S. casualty reinsurance market focused, in particular, on excess casualty as noted by John and Martin for all the factors we've been discussing. That said, as we head to the 1/1 renewal season, we think current market conditions will largely prevail in the casualty market at 1/1, that said, we continue to see downward pressure on ceding commissions for quota share deals averaging 100 basis points. Therefore, that's a rate increase, excess of loss contracts, more robust rate increases in the 5% to 25% range and maybe many structural changes to get those deals across the line. We do expect adequate capacity in the marketplace, maybe more limited for [XLL] deals. Thus far, these deals are challenging but they're getting done, they're getting across the line in the marketplace. And I really think the key for our clients, as Martin and John have said is going to be the performance of their underlying portfolios. Are they getting underlying rate increases in their books? Are they managing limits in excess casualty and other lines that will be the key formula for successful for renewal. But casualty is challenging right now in the market, but we think it's stable and most deals will get done.
John Doyle : So clear signs of loss cost inflation, loss development patterns disrupted by the impact of the economy and closing of courts during the pandemic and then kind of the economic rebound. So it's challenging for all of us to get our arms around it. And we're obviously doing our best to help clients navigate the uncertainty around it. Brian, do you have a follow-up?
Brian Meredith : Yes, absolutely, John. And I know we've talked about this before, but maybe just your perspective on the business continuing to flow to the non-admitted market. Do you think that's slowing here? And then also, how can Marsh kind of react to that to mitigate that or maybe recapture share? And does McGriff have anything that could potentially help you benefit you in the non-admitted area?
John Doyle : To be clear, we're not losing share as a result of the growth in the E&S market in the United States, you're seeing -- you have seen and observed outsized growth in wholesale broking as a result of that. But we have access to those markets and we'll access that capital if it's the right solution for our clients. Generally, we prefer admitted solutions for our clients given kind of what comes with being an admitted insurer. So our strategy is about accessing as much of the market directly, including E&S insurers as possible. And overwhelmingly, the E&S premium that we place into the market today, we do directly today, right? So to be clear. In terms of market growth, future market growth, it's hard to say, but -- and I certainly understand in this dynamic risk environment, certainly multichannel insurers that have both admitted and non-admitted, why they want to use more non-admitted solutions, it gives them more flexibility to react more quickly to the changing risk environment. So I understand that. Again, our focus is accessing capital as directly as possible and as efficiently as possible so we can continue to drive the best solutions for our clients. We'll continue to use wholesale brokers, but for niche expertise where they serve us and our client well. So anyway, that's really how we see it, Brian.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Grace Carter with Bank of America.
Grace Carter : I was hoping to ask a couple of cleanup questions regarding McGriff. Is there any possibility that you all might give us some of the below-the-line impacts, like, how much you're thinking amortization might increase associated with the deal? And any sort of transaction or integration expenses that we should expect over the next few quarters?
John Doyle : No, we're not prepared to do that. As I said, it's typical MMA transactions. So we haven't disclosed margins or the underlying performance of the businesses other than I will say, we're very impressed with the performance of McGriff. It's had strong underlying revenue growth. Sales velocity is quite strong as well, very similar to the performance of MMA.
Grace Carter : And I guess on the tax rate, I know it's a bit early to be looking at next year, but just kind of considering how the geographic mix of the business might be impacted by the deal. I mean is kind of the 25% to 26.5% original guide for this year still kind of fair to assume. And while we're on the subject of tax, if you could help us maybe think about the time line for utilizing the DTA that you're getting?
John Doyle : We're not going to guide to 2025. We'll talk about that in January on the call. So Mark, anything else to share on tax overall?
Mark Christopher : Just to your question on the deferred tax assets. So the value I talked about is the present value of the future tax deduction stream that we affect and that is going to go out over a long period of time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs.
Rob Cox : Appreciate that it's the largest MMA year in MMC's history. I'm curious if the price you're paying for top 100 brokers has changed your thought process at all on relative capital deployment across the different avenues.
John Doyle : Look, we've talked about our approach to capital management. We favor investing in the business over buybacks. We -- as you know, aspire to be -- to raise our dividend each and every year as well. We have a responsibility, obviously, to be good stewards of our capital. So we are -- although multiples have increased over the course of the last several years, we have great confidence in our ability to earn a return well in excess of our cost of capital. And so should that change or should we see a deal that doesn't accomplish those objectives. We'll deploy capital elsewhere. But we have a very strong reputation as a buyer in the marketplace. We spend a lot of time game planning various scenarios from small to mid-sized kind of tuck-in store business to more material deals like McGriff and we're very well positioned in that marketplace. Mark talked about even after McGriff, we maintain a lot of flexibility if we see the opportunity to make -- not make ourselves not just bigger but better as a business going forward. So that's our approach. Do you have a follow-up, Rob?
Rob Cox : Yes, I just wanted to ask a question on something that I feel like doesn't get a lot of airtime, but I was hoping to get an update on the commission rates and fee rates in the brokerage operations. Is there anything you can tell us about how these take rates have changed over the course of the hard market in recent years? And if not, what's driving the stability?
John Doyle : I actually -- I don't view the last several years as a hard market, right? Just to start with that. I thought what we observed as challenging it was for our retail clients at Marsh was largely kind of a catch-up period for insurers on average to catch up with the accelerating loss cost. Not to say certain markets in a shorter period of time were challenging. For example, when ransomware picked up in the cyber market and the underwriting community have not really priced for that kind of risk, the market jumped pretty quickly, but then it settled quite quickly as well. And in fact, the market is coming back in favor of our retail clients a bit at the moment. So I would start with that. But over a fairly extended period of time, our average commission rates at Marsh have remained fairly stable. From product line to product line, there's some movement, but for the most part average acquisition expense through Marsh has been pretty constant.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with TD Cowen.
Andrew Kligerman : Your underlying growth in RIS is nothing shy of outstanding. And we looked last year at double-digit underlying growth this year, it's kind of decelerated down to 6%, which is still excellent, but the question for you going forward and I know you guide to mid-single-digit or better underlying growth across businesses. So what kind of gives you the confidence that it kind of holds in this kind of zone, maybe even slightly less and doesn't decelerate further?
John Doyle : We always have time for you, Andrew, just to be clear. Look, as I mentioned in our -- in my prepared remarks, the macro environment remains supportive of growth overall, but we're in this elevated risk environment, geopolitical risk, frequency and severity of weather, cyber events, loss cost inflation, all those things creating opportunities for us to help clients. And pricing has moderated but markets have been disciplined overall. And we've been very focused on building and adding to our capabilities, right? And McGriff is kind of the latest example of that. We're investing organically and inorganically. We've been reshaping the mix of our business over time, right? So McGriff is another example of deploying capital into the faster-growing middle market. I would also note that we're working together better than we ever have as well. That's driving some real growth opportunities for us as well. So again, we'll guide around 2025 in January. But I feel like we're executing well and in this elevated risk environment. There's real opportunities for us to continue to drive good growth in our business.
Andrew Kligerman : And you just touched on the faster growth in MMA. Any color, John, that you could provide around how much it outpaces large corporate business.
John Doyle : Yes. I mean we're not going to disclose kind of segment growth, but it is higher. It's over time. And by the way, not in every quarter and in every year for that matter over the course of the last several years has it outpaced the upmarket growth at Marsh, but it's been a more consistent growth business for us. And what really excites me about that marketplace is how we can bring scale benefits to clients really at a different level. So -- and I think McGriff is a great example. It's a terrific business with outstanding fundamentals, terrific leadership outstanding talent all throughout its business. And we've shown, and as we've brought firms into MMA, we can make them even stronger. We can bring capabilities from MMA and Marsh to help them better serve clients. So we are excited about that.
John Doyle : So thank you. Andrew, I appreciate the questions. And Andrew, I think we'll wrap up the call at this point given that we're having a fire alarm in our building. So I want to thank you all for joining us on the call. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. So thank you all and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This does conclude today's program, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-18 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh McLennan's Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Second quarter 2024 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn this over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.
John Doyle: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second-quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. On the call with me is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Pat Tomlinson of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. Before I get into our results, I'd like to comment on the attempted assassination of former US President, Donald Trump, this past weekend. We're thankful that he is safe and our hearts go out to the victims and their loved ones. Violence has no place in our politics or our society. We condemn it and affirm our commitment to civil discussion, debate, and resolution. Our political process and democracy depend on all candidates having the ability to safely convey their visions for our country. We believe that each of us can help shape peaceful public discourse and advocate for a culture of respect and unity. Now, turning to the second quarter, Marsh McLennan delivered strong results across our businesses and geographies. We generated 6% underlying revenue growth on top of 11% in the second quarter of last year, reflecting strong execution in both RIS and Consulting. We grew adjusted operating income a 11% from a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points and adjusted EPS grew 10%. We also announced a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.815 and completed $300 million of share repurchases during the quarter. These results highlight our consistent focus on delivering in the near term while investing for sustained growth over the long term. We're benefiting from organic investments we've made in our talent and capabilities, and we also continue to make high-quality acquisitions that build on the scale and breadth of our business. In the second quarter, we announced several significant transactions. Mercer announced an agreement to acquire Cardano, a long-term savings specialist in the UK and Netherlands. With approximately $66 billion in AUM, Cardano operates the third-largest UK master trust platform and serves more than 2 million customers across 27,000 employers. This transaction builds on our leading position in OCIO, enhances our DC offerings, and adds important trading capabilities. Oliver Wyman agreed to acquire Veritas Total Solutions, an advisor in commodity and energy markets. And Marsh McLennan Agency completed three acquisitions in the quarter. Fisher Brown Bottrell, one of the five largest bank affiliate agencies in the United States. Specializing in commercial P&C insurance and employee benefits, FBB expands our presence across the Southeast. AC Risk Management builds on our scale in commercial P&C in the Northeast and Perkins Insurance Agencies adds to our commercial P&C business in Texas. Last week, MMA also announced the acquisition of Horton, a Top 100 broker with over $100 million in revenue, operating primarily in the Midwest. And we recently announced the acquisitions of AmeriStar, a commercial P&C high-net-worth agency based in Minnesota, and Hudson Shore, a public sector employee benefits agency in New Jersey. These acquisitions are great examples of our ability to attract the very best insurance agencies to our company. And along with high rates of sustained underlying growth, they've helped to make MMA a $3.5 billion annual revenue business. We also continue to help our clients thrive by investing in innovation. Drawing on our expertise, perspective, data and insights, we are creating new solutions for a complex environment. For example, Marsh continues to evolve Blue[i], a digital suite of solutions for insurance strategy decisions that uses our data and analytics to generate insights for clients. This quarter, we added Blue[i] Risk Appetite Analytics to help clients define the amount and type of risk they're willing to retain. With customizable calculations, our insights help clients navigate a challenging landscape with greater confidence. Guy Carpenter launched CatStop+, a new solution to address the volatility of cyber risk using GC's proprietary analytics. CatStop+ offers clients protection against Cyber CAT losses. Mercer launched SelectRx, a technology solution in the US that creates competition amongst pharmacies for high-cost specialty medications. Leveraging Free Market Health's cloud-based platform, SelectRx lowers costs for employers and delivers savings to employees by directing prescriptions to a curated network of specialty pharmacies. And Oliver Wyman is helping our clients innovate in their own businesses with the launch of Quotient, which combines our expertise in AI implementation, deployment, and strategic advisory with our deep industry knowledge. Quotient moves clients beyond the hype surrounding AI to deliver real value and meaningful outcomes. Our approach to balancing near-term performance with investment and innovation delivers significant value to our clients. It also enables us to sustain growth over the long term and drive consistent exceptional performance for shareholders. Shifting to the macro picture, we continue to see significant opportunity to help clients navigate the complexity they're facing today. Beyond the shocking assassination attempt in the US, the geopolitical backdrop is unsettled with ongoing wars and areas of tension across the globe. Uncertainty also remains around the frequency of extreme weather, escalating cyber-attacks, and key variables in the economic outlook, like the persistence of inflation and the timing of changes to central bank policy. Despite this uncertainty, the environment remains supportive of growth in our business. In general, we see continued economic growth in most of our major markets. The cost of risk in healthcare continues to rise and labor markets remain tight. And the consensus probability of a near-term recession for major economies continues to decrease. We have performed well across economic cycles due to the resilience of our business, sustained demand for our advice and solutions, and consistent execution for our clients. Turning to insurance and reinsurance market conditions, the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index was flat overall in the second quarter versus a 1% increase in the first quarter. Generally, rates in the US, Europe, and Latin America continued to increase in the low to mid-single-digits, while the UK, Asia, and Pacific saw low to mid-single-digit decreases. Global property rates were flat versus up 3% in the first quarter. Casualty increased in the low-single digits with US excess casualty up 10% in the quarter, while workers' compensation decreased low single-digits. Financial and professional liability rates and cyber pricing were down 5% and 6%, respectively. Midyear reinsurance renewals reflected increased demand for property cat with easing rates after significant increases in 2023. The majority of property placements were completed at renewal with adequate capacity. The global property cat reinsurance rates were generally flat to down mid-single-digits with greater decreases for upper layers on accounts without losses. The cat bond market had the most active quarter on record with over 30 new bonds issued involving approximately $8 billion of limit. Casualty programs faced continued underwriting scrutiny, but there was adequate capacity in the market. Excess of loss programs with US exposure saw upward pricing pressure, while quota share ceding commissions were flat to down slightly. As always, we are helping our clients navigate these dynamic market conditions. Now, let me turn to our second-quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.41, which is up 10% from a year ago. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 6%. Underlying revenue grew 7% in RIS and 4% in Consulting. Marsh was up 7%, Guy Carpenter 11%, Mercer 5%, and Oliver Wyman grew 3%. Overall, the second quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 11% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points year-over-year. Turning to our outlook, we are well-positioned for another great year in 2024. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth, another year of margin expansion, and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Our outlook assumes current macro conditions persist. However, meaningful uncertainty remains and the economic backdrop could be materially different than our assumptions. Overall, I'm proud of our second-quarter performance, which demonstrates continued execution on key initiatives and momentum across our business. I'm grateful to our colleagues for their focus and determination, and the value they deliver to our clients, shareholders, and communities. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, John, and good morning. Our second-quarter results were strong with solid underlying growth, significant margin expansion, and 10% growth in adjusted EPS. Our consolidated revenue increased 6% to $6.2 billion with underlying growth of 6%. Operating income was $1.6 billion and adjusted operating income was $1.7 billion, up 11%. Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points to 29%. GAAP EPS was $2.27 and adjusted EPS was $2.41. For the first six months of 2024, underlying revenue growth was 8%, our adjusted operating income grew 11% to $3.7 billion, our adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points and our adjusted EPS increased 12% to $5.30. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, second-quarter revenue was $4 billion, up 8% from a year ago or 7% on an underlying basis. This result marks the 14th consecutive quarter of 7% or higher underlying growth in RIS and continues the best stretch of growth in two decades. RIS operating income was $1.3 billion in the second quarter. Adjusted operating income was also $1.3 billion, up 12% over last year and our adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 35.3%. For the first six months of the year, revenue in RIS was $8.3 billion with underlying growth of 8%, adjusted operating income increased 12% to $2.9 billion and our margin increased 90 basis points to 37.3%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $3.3 billion, up 8% from a year ago or 7% on an underlying basis. This strong growth came on top of 10% growth in the second quarter of last year. Growth in the second quarter reflected strong new business and solid renewals. In US and Canada, underlying growth was 6% for the quarter. International underlying growth was 7%. EMEA was up 7%, Asia-Pacific grew 7%, and Latin America was up 8%. For the first six months of the year, Marsh's revenue was $6.3 billion with underlying growth of 7%. US and Canada grew 7% and international was up 8%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $632 million in the quarter, up 10% or 11% on an underlying basis. This terrific result came on top of 11% growth last year and was driven by double-digit growth across most geographies and specialties. For the first six months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated $1.8 billion of revenue and 9% underlying growth. In the Consulting segment, second quarter revenue was $2.2 billion, up 2% from a year ago or 4% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $410 million and adjusted operating income was $426 million, up 6%. Our adjusted operating margin in Consulting was 19.8% in the second quarter, an increase of 60 basis points. For the first six months of 2024, Consulting revenue was $4.4 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 6%. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $870 million and our margin increased 50 basis points to 20.3%. Mercer's revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, flat compared to a year ago, but up 5% on an underlying basis. This was Mercer's 13th straight quarter of 5% or higher underlying growth and continues the best run of growth in 15 years. Wealth grew 3%, driven by growth in both Investment Management and DB Consulting. Our assets under management were $492 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 1% sequentially and up 25% compared to the second quarter of last year. Year-over-year growth was driven by our transaction with Vanguard, impact of capital markets, and positive net flows. Health underlying growth remained strong at 9% and reflected growth across all regions. Career revenue increased 2%, continuing the trend of modest growth following a two-year stretch of strong growth in demand. For the first six months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $2.8 billion with 6% underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $837 million, an increase of 3% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 11% growth a year ago. For the first six months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $1.6 billion, an increase of 8% on an underlying basis, up from 6% growth in the first half of last year. Foreign exchange was a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.02 headwind in the third quarter and $0.02 in the fourth quarter. Total noteworthy items in the quarter were $73 million. These included $44 million of restructuring costs, mostly related to the program we began in the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as some transaction-related expenses. Our other net benefit credit was $66 million in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect our other net benefit credit will be approximately $265 million. Interest expense in the second quarter was $156 million, up from $146 million in the second quarter last year, reflecting higher levels of debt and higher interest rates. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $154 million of interest expense in the third quarter and approximately $620 million for the full year. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 26.2% compared with 24.2% in the second quarter of last year. Our tax rate in both periods benefited from favorable discrete items. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 26.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of between 25.5% and 26.5% for 2024. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with total debt of $13.5 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in the first quarter of 2025 when $500 million of senior notes mature. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4.5 billion of capital in 2024 across dividends, acquisitions, and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. Last week, we announced a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend, making this our 15th consecutive year of dividend growth. This comes on top of a 20% increase a year ago and reflects our strong earnings growth and confidence in our outlook. Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $1.7 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1.2 billion and included $352 million for dividends, $500 million for acquisitions, and $300 million for share repurchases. For the first six months, uses of cash totaled $2.2 billion and included $706 million for dividends, $847 million for acquisitions, and $600 million for share repurchases. While there continues to be uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy, we feel good about the momentum in our business and the current environment remains supportive of growth. Overall, our excellent first half leaves us well-positioned for another great year in 2024. Based on our outlook today, for the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or better underlying growth, margin expansion, and strong growth in adjusted EPS. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to John.
John Doyle: Thank you, Mark. Andrew, we are ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: Thanks. Good morning. I just had a question on the underlying revenue growth outlook of mid-single-digit or greater. You guys just did 8% in the first half of underlying revenue growth, but are increasing the range to high single-digit. Could you just help me think through the puts and takes in terms of why you guys aren't increasing the range?
John Doyle: Good morning, David. Sure. So yeah, let me first of all, just say, I was pleased with our growth in the quarter. It was on top of a very big quarter a year ago at 11%. Marsh had good solid growth by region and practice on top of a tough comp. Guy Carpenter had an excellent quarter. Market improvements led to increased demand after a pretty volatile reinsurance market in 2023. Mercer again had another solid quarter of growth, as Mark noted in his comments, best growth -- stretch of growth in a long period of time. Health remains very strong. Wealth growth was solid and we actually saw an uptick in career growth from the first quarter. And Oliver Wyman had a very tough comp, but had good growth -- has had good growth year-to-date. And as we pointed out in the past, we'll have more quarter-to-quarter volatility than our other businesses. What I would say is broadly speaking, the macros continue to be supportive of growth. It's a risky environment we're all operating in, but GDP, inflation, labor markets, the cost -- rising cost of risk, rising cost of healthcare, all supportive. And I feel very, very -- I feel like we're very well-positioned. We have the best talent in the markets that we compete in. And so, we're positive on our outlook for the second half, that again remains a good market for us. And so we feel good about where we are.
David Motemaden: Got it. Thanks, John. And then, Mark, I think you mentioned on last quarter's call that you guys are expecting greater margin expansion in the second half than in the first half. Is that still the case?
John Doyle: You want to go ahead, Mark?
Mark McGivney: Yeah. We're really happy with 130 basis points and it validated the statements we made about the first-quarter margin expansion facing headwinds from several items. So we were good -- we're glad to see the acceleration and we're on track for solid margin expansion for the year.
John Doyle: Thank you, David. Andrew, next question.
Operator: One moment please for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hey, good morning. So first, John, just following up on your comments on Oliver Wyman. The growth this quarter slowed versus what it's been in the last few quarters. How much of that is a function of just tough comps and normal volatility in the business versus maybe a slowdown in the pipeline?
John Doyle: Yeah, Jimmy, thanks for the question you know and I'll hand it to Nick here. But was it -- I think it's sum of both, right? But it's a -- it was a tough comp for sure, but we feel very good about the year-to-growth -- growth -- year-to-date growth. Excuse me. Nick, you want to add a little bit more depth?
Nick Studer: Yeah. I think John is right, Jimmy, it's a little bit of both, but in the same way that I noted last quarter that our 13% was against a weak 0% comp, this 3% is against a tougher 11%. That 8% year-to-date, I think is bang in that zone of mid to high-single-digit growth we expect to average through the cycle. And as you know, our quarters are always somewhat volatile. Mark kindly noted in his comments that the first half actually accelerated versus the first half last year. To give you a little bit of color on where we are seeing higher growth, regionally, both Asia and our India, Middle-East, and Africa regions have continued on strong growth. From an industry perspective, our communications, media, and technology practice has been our fastest-growing year-to-date, but our very strong banking and insurance practices also in positive territory as is our public sector practice. And we have a wide array of capabilities. And our economic research business, NERA, growing strongly. Our market-leading finance and risk practice, particularly in financial services, our pricing team. And importantly, our people and organizational performance practice, which really works across our industries to help on big client transformative moments. But the market is a little bit uncertain. While the economy seems to be better, it's still a pressured environment for discretionary spending, some uncertainties as John and Mark have highlighted. And we do see -- we're sort of working through some pricing pressure due to excess capacity as some of our competitors work through some of their headcount actions.
John Doyle: Thank you, Nick. Jimmy, do you have a follow-up?
Jimmy Bhullar: Yeah, just on -- and maybe it's for Mark on fiduciary investment income. It was -- it's been sort of flattish on a sequential basis. So should we assume given where rates are that going forward, it's going to grow just with growth in the business or was the sequential flat results in 2Q more of a function of seasonality and balances or other factors?
John Doyle: Mark?
Mark McGivney: Jimmy, there is -- there is seasonality in balances as we've talked about in the past. But I think the biggest driver, I think, from here is just going to be the outlook for rates. As we've talked about and you saw on our balance sheet in the quarter, we've got about $11.5 billion of fiduciary balances and so I think just where we go from here is just going to be what the central banks do with short-term interest rates. And just as you're modeling going forward, keep in mind that our balances do reflect the revenue mix of our business. So it's not just US rates, obviously that drive -- we've got balances because of the distributed nature of business all over the world. So yeah, so as I said, the outlook really is going to be mostly a function of what the rate picture looks like.
John Doyle: Thank you, Jimmy. Andrew, next question?
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, within RIS, can you give us a sense of how much of the expenses helped your margins in the quarter?
John Doyle: Expense saves, can you give me a [indiscernible] Okay. Okay. Sure. Sure. Thanks, Elyse. Mark?
Mark McGivney: Yeah. Elyse, we're definitely seeing the benefit of it. We've stayed away from quantifying specifically how much is going to drop quarter-to-quarter. But you just even see the trend in expense growth quarter-to-quarter that was definitely a factor. Our strong growth and the benefit of savings contributed to that 130 basis points of margin expansion. So we're -- as I said, we haven't quantified the amount that we're seeing each quarter, but we are on track for the level of savings that we talked about and we're seeing the benefit of it.
John Doyle: Do you have a follow-up, Elyse?
Elyse Greenspan: Yeah. And then my second question within Marsh, could you just give us a sense of what you're seeing, some more color in both the US and internationally within organic growth, both for the Q2 and then how you think about the outlook in the back half of the year? And are US or internationally, are you guys more indexed to property in one versus the other?
John Doyle: Yeah. I mean the markets are quite dynamic, right? And so, I would just caution you a little bit on pricing, right? I think Guy Carpenter is a good indication of that, right? So we saw a better market lead to increased demand. But as I mentioned earlier, it was a good solid growth by region and by practice, again in the second quarter and on top of a tough comp. But Martin, maybe you could share a little bit more color on growth international versus US and the demand you're seeing.
Martin South: Sure. So just to restate 7% in the quarter, which is on top of 10% for the second quarter of '23. Quite balanced growth, the international at 7% and the US at 6% -- US and Canada at 6%. Our US business MMA and Victor continued to perform very well in the US. Canada had a weaker quarter, some macros there affected that, that pulled down a little bit. But across the international region, international was a 7% on top of 10% in '23. Asia-Pacific accelerated from 7% on top of 6% in '23, and Latin-America did 8% on top of 17% in the second quarter of '23 and EMEA did 7% on top of 11% in '23. The performance was driven really by very strong performance internationally in the benefits business. Construction, energy, and power all came off strong double-digit growth as well, repeating what happened last year. And we're beginning to see some revitalization in the US capital markets, which has been a headwind for new business growth going back to '21. Renewal base growth was strong and solid, as was new business in both US and Canada and international. And our lost business improved slightly as we continue to build stickier relationships with clients as we engage more deeply, and we aspire to be the risk advisor of the future, talking to them well beyond conventional risk. We feel very well-positioned. Overall, the mix of premium in the US will be more weighted to casualty in its broad terms and probably more balanced in international for property-casualty to answer your -- in terms of property to answer your question.
John Doyle: Yeah, reflection of the liability environment in the US for sure. Thank you, Elyse, and thanks, Martin. Andrew, next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Heleniak with RBC Capital Markets.
Scott Heleniak: Yeah, good morning. Just a quick question. Given the M&A pace has been pretty strong over the past few quarters and certainly for the year, just wondering if we should assume kind of a deceleration in the run-rate for share backs -- share buybacks in the second half versus the first half? Just how you're thinking about that and how is your M&A tracking versus kind of what you thought going into the year?
John Doyle: Yeah. Sure, Scott. Thanks for the question. No change to our philosophy. We continue to take a balanced approach to capital management. We have about $4.5 billion to deploy during the course of the year. Broadly speaking, we favor attractive investments in our business, whether it's organic or inorganic over buybacks, but we're not going to let cash build up on the balance sheet either. And as I noted earlier, we increased our dividend beginning in this quarter. I mean, we aspire to raise our dividend every year. We bought back $300 million in the -- of shares in the second quarter. We're pleased with what we've seen in the -- in the M&A market. As I said, it was an active quarter. I mean, we announced a couple of deals really at the start here of the second quarter just after the 1st of July. And so, we're excited about those deals and we'll continue to be active in the market. But ultimately, the amount of share repurchase will depend on what's obviously a volatile M&A. You never know what the ultimate outcome will be in M&A but we're seeing some good opportunities to invest in our business. Do you have a follow-up?
Scott Heleniak: Yeah. Just one quick one, too. Just generally on Mercer, the Health organic growth really strong again, and 9% has been strong for quite a while. And Career and Wealth, I guess, is a little bit slower compared to Health, but just wondering if you can just kind of flesh out what you're seeing there, the strength in Health versus the other areas, if there's anything kind of holding those -- back those areas besides just the kind of difficult comps?
John Doyle: Yeah. Thanks, Scott, and I'll ask Pat to comment in a second. But I mentioned rising healthcare costs in my opening remarks. It's a big pressure point for our clients in this economy. And so -- and particularly given the tight labor markets in most major economies around the world. So -- it's really a terrific value we're delivering to our clients in a very tough marketplace there. Wealth is going to have some volatility as well Career quarter-to-quarter, but Pat, maybe you could talk a little bit about what we're seeing in the marketplace.
Pat Tomlinson: Sure. Thanks, and thanks so much for the question. First off, we're pleased with the Q2 underlying growth of 5%. As Mark highlighted, our 13th consecutive quarter with 5% or more growth and that all the practices are contributing to growth. Certainly, health has been contributing at a higher rate. Quickly to kind of go through the practices and what we're seeing. Health, as you highlighted, had that impressive quarter with 9% growth. The strong performance was broad-based, right? So there was double-digit growth across most regions. It comes predominantly from investments in hiring new talent, investments in thought leadership, including our Health on Demand survey, new digital tools, and a focus on client segmentation that's really designed to match our clients' healthcare needs with our innovative and tailored solutions. We benefited from renewal and some new business growth, some insurer revenue, and has been highlighted a couple of times in the call, medical cost inflation, certainly. We continue to see strong demand for digital solutions and innovative benefits underscoring really the value of -- and the breadth of advice and solutions we bring to clients. Little less growth in Wealth and Career. So let me quickly go through them. Wealth, we grew the 3% in Q2. That was balanced between DD&A and IMS, right? So DB plans funding status continue to benefit from elevated interest rates. It's driving an increase in project work, predominantly revolving around risk transfers as well as certain regulatory requirements that are out in some of the jurisdictions around the world. We head in the volatile capital markets, it's been driving some strong demand for actuarial and the investment solutions. John had highlighted in OCIO we did benefit from the transaction with Vanguard. We had some net new inflows and capital markets also provided a revenue lift. It's important to note that on IMS, from a business perspective, it's a portfolio of solutions, right, that includes some advisory work and some DC administration in addition to OCIO. So a lot of times, it's typically looked at as OCIO. And only our OCIO business is directly impacted by AUM. So as we've seen a market run-up, really, we only have a subset of that business that's directly impacted by AUM. And our AUM is a diversified portfolio where equities only make up about half of our exposure, right, because we have a lot of clients that have heavy fixed income exposure. So while the markets can drive some volatility for us, the impact of equity markets is a bit more muted in IMS growth. And then on Career, which had the most modest growth of 2%, which was up sequentially over quarter, it is following a long period of growth after the pandemic. We saw good growth momentum from a couple of our practices, talent and transformation. Rewards was a bit more muted. And I think that's predominantly reflecting the impact of lower wage inflation and reduced employee turnover, which is driving some slightly lower demand for our clients at rewards projects. But I think it's also important to note here that while the growth rates fell down, has been flat even over the last couple of quarters, it's been a bit more modest. The overall size of our Career practice is nearly 20% larger than it was pre-pandemic. So that's -- so we feel very strong about that that we've been able to maintain those levels in a predominantly project-based business. So, overall, I think the conditions have us very positive about the outlook for Mercer.
John Doyle: Terrific. Thank you, Pat. Scott, thank you for your questions. Andrew, next question.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. Great. Good morning. Focusing on the property cat's key pricing environment, I guess, competitive environment. John, I believe you said that Marsh index [deceled] (ph) again to zero from one. Just curious, given Marsh does have a lot more small to mid-account business now too, it feels like there's like two different tales, two different stories going on between the large account and the SMid accounts. I don't know if you'd agree with that. And if yes, any color you could offer kind of why we're seeing two different trends there on pricing?
John Doyle: Sure, sure. Sure, Mike. Thanks. Thanks for the question. I'll share some high-level thoughts, and then maybe I'll ask both Martin and Dean to talk about some market observations. I would note, Mike, just right out of the gate here that typically, larger account pricing has more volatility attached to it. If you look back on historical cycles, that's been the case. Mid-market pricing has historically been more stable or more consistent, I guess, and have less volatility from cycle to cycle. And our index is weighted towards large accounts to be clear, where we have the best data. But insurance and reinsurance markets continue to settle in the quarter after what's been many years of increases. It's not just middle versus large, it's a collection of markets. And while as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, cyber and FinPro, maybe the best example, prices continue to moderate. Some segments of the market are showing some -- what might be early signs of stress. US Excess Casualty, for example, prices were up 10%, and loss cost inflation there remains quite challenging. But overall, right now, market is providing an opportunity for our clients to revisit some decisions they've made about financing risk and that tighter market conditions led them to make uncertain decisions. So it's a welcome moment for many of our clients to revisit some of those decisions. And Guy Carpenter, as I mentioned earlier, it led to greater demand in the second quarter as evidenced by our strong growth. But Martin, maybe you could share a little bit more color on what we're seeing in the pricing market?
Martin South: Sure. Just reminding ourselves, 26 quarters of rate increases, which just turned flat now. And as John noted, the -- our index is geared much more towards the larger account segment of our business. And obviously, the mid-market business in the smaller end has less volatility in pricing. But just by line of business, casualty in the US is up 3%, which, as John said, is really dominated by the 10% increase in the umbrella book, which we talked about in earlier calls about the volatility in claims inflation there. Property is flat in most regions, except for the Middle East and India, where we're still seeing some increases in property, maybe as a result of some of the activity in the Middle East in this past quarter. Core FinPro contracting at 5%, with rate decline pretty much across the world, and cyber contracting 6% which is mostly consistent with what we saw in Q1. The pricing trends consistent with recent quarters, we're seeing some slight increases in geographies, but rate contraction is more than normal. And so those are the key issues really that I would comment on now. But of course, as far as our business is concerned, we -- a lot of our business is fee-based or controlled commission basis, and exposure growth has been significant over the last few years as well, which is a counterweight to that.
John Doyle: Thanks, Martin. Dean, maybe you can just quickly cover the reinsurance market.
Dean Klisura: Yeah, thanks, John. And, Mike, just a couple of headlines about the property cat reinsurance market, which certainly is connected to the underlying property market that Martin is describing. As John noted, it's a much more predictable and smooth market than we experienced last year in the 2023 hard market for property cat. Placements have been completed on time. There's been adequate capacity in the marketplace for our clients. There's an increased reinsurer appetite in the market, and we know why, right? They're driving 20% plus ROEs in this market given the rate increases of last year and the higher attachment points our clients have been forced to absorb with greater volatility. We're seeing very strong ILS activity in the market. John noted, record cat bond issuance in the quarter, 34 discrete cat bonds, some $8 billion of limit in the quarter. And I think that we're seeing moderating cat rates in the market compared to 2023. But I would say that if you look at year-over-year premium spend for property cat and our rate online index, it's still up 1% year-over-year. It has not gone negative in the market. And really, as John noted, Mike, I think the headline, the key takeaway is significant increased client demand for additional property cat limit. In the first half of the year, two-thirds of our US clients bought more property cat coverage across an additional $10 billion of limit, which is truly significant in the marketplace. We're also seeing clients reinsure by more retrocession coverage with improved pricing, market dynamics, improved appetite by sellers, both rated and ILS vehicles in the market. And I think the last headline for you is there's caution in the property market. There's $50 billion-plus of insured losses in the first half of the year. When you think about severe convective storms in the US and Japan, Taiwanese earthquake, floods in Germany, the UAE, Baltimore bridge collapse, Hurricane Beryl, I mean we could be on track for another $100 billion a year of insured losses. So there's caution in the market around property and property debt.
John Doyle: Thanks, Dean. So, Mike, not a big shift from the first quarter, but a modest evolving market more in favor of buyers. And so that obviously factors into the advice we give to our clients and help them navigate what's a world where, again, the cost of risk continues to escalate. Do you have a follow-up?
Michael Zaremski: Yeah. Very quick follow-up. Thank you. Just not to nitpick, but if I'm just looking at total revenue growth and I guess, ultimately, EBITDA adjusted, I think divestitures and maybe a little FX is what, I think, us and maybe the consensus was off on a little bit. Just want to make sure there's nothing missing, it's still a net acquirer in terms of M&A, but is there chunky divestitures? Is there anything I should be thinking about in the very near term that -- in terms of that impact?
John Doyle: No, no. I mean at Mercer, we sold two admin businesses, one in the US, one in the UK to Aptia. And the reason we sold them is they're relatively low-growth and lower-margin businesses. And again on a relative basis, they were capital-intensive. And so we think they have a better owner now and so we feel good about that decision. Thank you, Mike. Andrew, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James.
Gregory Peters: Well, good morning. I guess I'd like to just go back to some comments you made in your prepared remarks. You mentioned Blue[i]. I was wondering if you could provide some more specific data around that. It's a data analytics business, just provide some scope of how big it is inside the business because you called it out in your call.
John Doyle: Yeah, it's not a business. It's part of really how we advise our clients at Marsh. And so Blue[i] is kind the brand, if you will, for our suite of analytics. And Martin, maybe you could just share some insight on the range of types of tools that we use that help our clients think about how they manage and finance risk.
Martin South: Sure. So as you said, John, this is a suite of analytics tools that we use to help our clients across different product lines assess what risks to retain, what risk they could transfer, the economic cost of that. We pay them across multiple lines to give them exposure and total cost of risk scenarios. We help them analyze claims and the analytics tools in that are able to help our clients who self-insure a lot of losses to identify which losses they need to get at early and how to settled those. So it's a range of real-time analytics built really, and it's one of the unique things about our business is that we have an enormous lake of data, and we think that's one of the big moats that we have to support our business. And some of these analytics tools that we use, we call them generically Blue[i]. We deploy on clients that actually don’t even buy insurance. They tend to be some of our biggest clients in the US. So we'll continue to invest in that. And as we announced in the call last year, we added to that with supply chain capability and -- so it's the way clients expect to be engaged, and that's the tool that we use.
John Doyle: So we use these tools to help -- and it's really mostly upfront, but to help them understand -- our clients understand those risks, strategies to manage and mitigate those risks. We spend most of our time on these calls for good reasons, talking about the financing of risk when we go to market, but it's an important part of our value proposition. It's another example of where we can bring scale benefits to the market, given the unique data set that we have and the range of proprietary analytics we use. And while it operates under a different brand, the same will be said for the way we approach our clients in the market at Guy Carpenter. Do you have a follow-up, Greg?
Gregory Peters: I sure do. Thanks for the color on that. Just going through the operating cash flow and the free cash flow for the six months, down a little bit. It looks like it's changes in working capital. Wondering if you could just provide some additional color on the operating cash flow for the quarter and the year -- six-month basis?
John Doyle: Sure, Greg. Yeah, it's going to be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. But Mark, maybe you can.
Mark McGivney: Yeah, Greg. Thanks. You will -- we always -- we'll always caution against focusing too much on a quarter's results, and that's certainly true when it comes to cash flows and free cash flow. They tend to be volatile, not only quarter to quarter, but year to year because of timing of balance sheet items. As you -- so when you look at the six months, we are seeing a decline of course, given the significant bonus payouts that we have in the first quarter, you have a little bit of a denominator -- small denominator issue. And so, you have to be cautious. But two big factors just in the first six months are the higher comp payouts that we had in the first quarter and then receivables are up because of the growth in the business. But we've got a, as you know, a long track record of double-digit growth in free cash flow that has stacked up well against our growth in earnings, and that's what you'd expect in a capital-light business like ours.
John Doyle: Thank you, Mark, and thanks, Greg, for the questions. Andrew, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning. I just had a follow-up on an earlier question on margins. So I think last quarter, you had said that you expected the margin to accelerate, particularly in the second half of the year. Sounded like from the response this morning that maybe that's no longer the case. So I guess just to be very clear, if we look at the 100 basis points or so of margin expansion in the first half of this year, would you expect that to be better in the second half or not? And I guess the second part of the question, will be -- if there was a bit of a change, is it because the margin expansion in the second quarter was greater than you initially expected or are you all expecting some softening relative to your guidance for the second half of the year?
John Doyle: No. We expect margin expansion in the second half to be better than the first half. Sorry, if we created any confusion earlier, but that's what we continue to expect. And maybe I can just share a little bit of color and just remind everybody, too, margins and outcome, right? This will be year 17 of -- 17th consecutive year of margin expansion, and so we feel terrific about that. But margin is an outcome of the way we run the business. We manage investments and costs within the revenue growth of the business. It's not going to happen in every business in every single quarter, but that’s -- it's the way we approach our business. We're going to continue to make attractive investments to support medium to long-term growth. But we see opportunities. As I've mentioned in the past, we've got workflow and automation efforts inside of Marsh. Mercer and Guy Carpenter. We're testing AI at scale. So that value creation is not a meaningful 2024 or probably 2025 event. But as technologies emerge, we'll continue to challenge ourselves to get better. But again, we do expect second-half margin expansion to be better than first half. Do you have a follow-up?
Yaron Kinar: Thanks so much for the color and clarification. I asked a two-part question, so I'll turn it back to you.
John Doyle: Got it. Thank you. Andrew, next question please.
Operator: One moment please. And our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Great. Thanks. Good morning, all. I guess to start, can you talk about how you're advising both insurance and reinsurance clients to think about their exposure to casualty lines following the overturning of the Chevron doctrine?
John Doyle: Well, I'm not sure I see a direct line between that particular case and the overall environment. But what I would say to you is that -- and what we've talked about on this call historically -- or I shouldn't say historically, but over the course of the last couple of years is just troubling signs of loss cost inflation, particularly here in the United States. And the amount of large or mega judgments and settlements is quite challenging. And so we spend a lot of time, and Martin talked briefly about the suite of analytics we use. It's inside of that suite of analytics, we help our clients think about a range of outcomes, what type of limits they should consider buying, how they might benchmark anonymously against others in their industry as an example. But that's -- those are all important inputs and ultimately, our clients make decisions and judgments and some have the ability to finance more risk or choose to finance more risk on their own. And others will look to finance risk on the balance sheets of insurance companies or in certain cases to capital markets as well. So I hope that's helpful, Meyer?
Meyer Shields: It is. Thank you. It is very good big picture. This is more of a small-picture issue. But when we look at, let's say, the two-year stacked organic growth in Career, that grew dramatically from the first quarter, I guess, you had [12% plus 1% at 13% in this quarter 6% plus 2%, to 8%] (ph). Is your outlook for Career based on the items or the issue you identified earlier, is that slowing compared to maybe what you thought at the end of the first quarter?
John Doyle: No, I don't think there's a real change from the first quarter. As Pat mentioned some of the dynamics, less active labor markets from a turnover point of view, lower comp [and ban] (ph) so it's a -- we didn't have expectations of higher growth in that business during the course of 2024, and we haven't seen anything through six months that changes that outlook.
Meyer Shields: Fantastic. Thank you very much.
John Doyle: Thank you. Andrew, time for maybe one more?
Operator: Certainly. And our final question comes from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs.
Rob Cox: Hey, thanks for fitting me in. John, I wanted to go back to something you said last quarter, which was that Marsh accesses most of its E&S market solutions directly today. I'm curious how that split between the percentage of premiums placed directly in E&S versus through a third-party wholesaler has trended over recent years and how you think that might trend going forward?
John Doyle: Yeah. Again, I -- just to be clear, we're not looking to build a third-party wholesale business. We want to bring the best solutions to our clients. The E&S markets moved quite a bit over the course of the last several years. That's really a reflection of the high risk environment that I've talked about where insurers have, broadly speaking, more freedom to change rate, to get off risk, to change price -- or to change terms and conditions as well. And so just broadly speaking, we want to manage our clients' outcomes and experiences directly as possible and not outsource what's an important part of the value proposition. It's not to say that wholesalers don't do a nice job for us, they do and we'll continue to access them where it makes sense. But -- but we -- most of the -- majority of the wholesale premium, we actually access directly today or E&S markets, we do that directly today. But there's been more growth in intermediated wholesale premium over the course of the last couple of years. And so our efforts are to try to get as much access to market as we can. Do you have a follow-up, Robert?
Rob Cox: Yeah. Thank you. That's a great color. Yeah, second question was just on sort of the different economics Guy Carpenter gets from cat bonds versus traditional reinsurance placement. And if you could help us think about how much that record cat bond quarter contributed to organic growth?
John Doyle: Yeah. The economics can be different, of course, and they're different from treaty to treaty as well. We work with our insurance company clients. As we talked about when the market was particularly tight last year, while commission is a factor and growing price was a factor in many respects, really what we do with our large insurance company clients is big wholesale relationships where effectively we work on, what amounts to a fee.
John Doyle: Thank you. Go ahead, Andrew.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan for any closing remarks.
John Doyle: Thanks, Andrew, and thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. Thank you all very much, and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-18 20:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh McLennan's Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. First quarter 2024 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn this over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.
John Doyle: Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. On the call with me is Mark McGivney, our CFO, and the CEOs of our businesses: Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman; and Pat Tomlinson of Mercer, who is joining us -- joining this call for the first time. Welcome, Pat. Also with us today is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh McLennan had a strong start to 2024. Our first quarter results were excellent, and we are well-positioned for another good year. Top-line [Technical Difficulty] continued with 9% underlying revenue growth, which was on top of 9% growth in the first quarter of last year. All of our businesses had strong revenue growth with Marsh, Mercer and Oliver Wyman accelerating growth from the fourth quarter. We grew adjusted operating income by 11% from a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023. We had adjusted EPS growth of 14%. And we completed $300 million of share repurchases in the quarter. In addition, we continue to add to our talent, capabilities and scale through acquisitions. These investments will help strengthen our strategic position and sustain top-line growth. For example, Mercer completed the purchase of Vanguard's OCIO business, which expands our reach into the endowments and foundation segment. MMA acquired two leading agencies in Louisiana, and Oliver Wyman closed the acquisition of SeaTec, which extends our capabilities in the aviation, transportation and defense industries. At Marsh McLennan, we bring together specialized capabilities and perspectives across risk, strategy and people to help clients make critical decisions with confidence. For example, in the area of supply chain risk, we developed a solution called [Centrisk] (ph), which draws on the perspective and capabilities of Marsh and Oliver Wyman to identify key risks in our client supply chains. Using this framework, we create a digital twin model of a client supply lines, which provides for a scenario-based vulnerability assessment to help manage risk. This product is already helping clients across multiple sectors, including in the banking, manufacturing, aviation and defense industries. As we noted last quarter, Marsh, Oliver Wyman and Guy Carpenter developed the Unity facility, a public-private insurance solution that enables grain shipments from Ukrainian ports. In the first quarter, we worked with the Ukrainian government, DZ Bank, Lloyd's and others to expand the facility to all ships carrying non-military cargo. This will help support Ukraine's economic resilience in time of war. In the healthcare sector, Marsh and Mercer are working together to help clients evaluate connections between talent retention, patient safety and the cost of malpractice insurance. Marsh's risk assessment capabilities and Mercer's extensive health and human capital expertise, combined with our rich datasets, are creating new, highly-valued perspectives in the healthcare sector. These are just a few examples of how we're applying our unique expertise to address pressing challenges and deliver significant value to clients. Recently, we released our Annual ESG Report. The report includes enhanced disclosure on our ESG efforts and underscores how the actions we're taking [Technical Difficulty] and on behalf of our clients also have a positive impact on the communities where we live and work. Let me share some examples. We collaborated with the Center for NYC Neighborhoods to launch a community-based catastrophe insurance program. This parametric insurance program helps finance emergency grants to community members following an event, with funds reaching households within days of a catastrophe. In cyber, we developed a global personal microinsurance solution to protect against threats like online identity theft, viruses, cyber-bullying and failure to deliver purchased goods. With regard to sustainability, we are supporting the Dubai Energy and Water Authority's commitment to provide 100% of its energy from clean sources by 2050. As part of this work, we conducted a client -- a climate resilience assessment of one of the world's largest solar parks. We modeled the site's ability to withstand future climate conditions and proposed adaptation measures to mitigate extreme risks. We continue to improve sustainability in our own operations as well. For example, in 2023, we expanded the use of renewable electricity across our US offices and in our largest UK locations. And we submitted our climate targets for validation as part of our goal to achieve net zero globally by 2050. We remain committed to generating exceptional financial performance and returns for shareholders, and we also recognize that the successful outcomes we help enable for our clients and our own actions can have a lasting positive effect on communities around the world. Shifting to the macro picture, we see significant opportunity to help clients navigate the range of outcomes driven by a more complex environment. The geopolitical backdrop remains unsettled with multiple major wars and rising tensions globally. More than half the world's population will go to elections in 2024, and the economic outlook remains uncertain as well. Despite this uncertainty, the environment is supportive of growth in our business. In general, we see continued economic growth in most of our major markets, inflation and interest rates remain elevated, labor markets are tight, the cost of risk is up, and healthcare costs continue to rise. We have a strong record of performance across economic cycles due to the resilience of our business and demand for our advice and solutions. Turning to insurance and reinsurance market conditions, primary insurance rates increased, with the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index up 1% overall in the quarter. Property rates increased 3% versus 6% in the fourth quarter. Casualty was up 3%, in line with last quarter. Workers' compensation decreased mid-single digits while financial and professional liability rates were down 7%, and cyber pricing decreased 6%. Reinsurance market conditions remained stable, with increased client demand and adequate capacity. In the April renewal period, US property cat reinsurance rates were flat with some decreases for accounts without losses. Loss-impacted accounts averaged increases in the 10% to 20% range. The US casualty reinsurance market was challenging, but rates were in line with January renewals. In January, April 1 property cat rates overall were down slightly on a risk-adjusted basis. Early signs for June 1 Florida cat risk renewals point to improved market conditions for cedents. Increased reinsurance appetite for growth should be adequate to meet higher demand. As always, we are helping our clients navigate these dynamic market conditions. Now, let me turn briefly to our first quarter financial performance, which Mark will cover in detail. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.89, which is up 14% versus a year ago. Revenue grew 9% on an underlying basis with 9% growth in both RIS and in consulting. Marsh was up 8%, Guy Carpenter grew 8%, Mercer 6%, and Oliver Wyman was up 13%. Overall, in the first quarter, we had adjusted operating income growth of 11%, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points year-over-year. Turning to our outlook, we are very well-positioned for another good year in 2024. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth, another year of margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Our outlook assumes current macro conditions persist. However, meaningful uncertainty remains and the economic backdrop could be materially different than our assumptions. In summary, the first quarter was a great start to the year for Marsh McLennan. Our business delivered strong performance and we continue to execute well on our strategic initiatives. I'm proud of the focus and determination of our colleagues and the value they deliver to our clients and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, John, and good morning. Our first quarter results were outstanding and represent an excellent start to the year. We saw continued momentum in underlying growth, strong margin expansion, double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. Our consolidated revenue increased 9% in the first quarter to $6.5 billion, underlying growth of 9%. Operating income was $1.9 billion, and adjusted operating income increased 11% to $2 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points to 32%, and we expect higher margin expansion for the rest of the year, particularly in the second half. GAAP EPS was $2.82, and adjusted EPS was $2.89, up 14% [Technical Difficulty] last year. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, first quarter revenue was $4.3 billion, up 9% compared with a year ago on both a reported and underlying basis. This result marks the 12th consecutive quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth in RIS and continues the best stretch of growth in two decades. RIS operating income was $1.6 billion in the first quarter. Adjusted operating income was also $1.6 billion, up 11% over last year, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 39.1%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter increased 9% to $3 billion or 8% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 9% growth in the first quarter of last year. In US and Canada, underlying growth was 8% for the quarter, reflecting solid renewal and new business growth. In international, underlying growth was strong at 8% and comes on top of 10% in the first quarter last year. EMEA was up 9%, Latin America grew 8%, and Asia-Pacific was up 6%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $1.1 billion, up 7%, or 8% on an underlying basis, driven by growth across most regions and Global Specialties. This was the fifth straight quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth at Guy Carpenter. In the Consulting segment, first quarter revenue was $2.2 billion, up 9% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $432 million, and adjusted operating income was $444 million, up 9%. Our adjusted operating margin in Consulting was 20.7% in the first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. Mercer's revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 6% on an underlying basis. This was Mercer's 12th straight quarter of 5% or higher underlying growth and continues the best run of growth in 15 years. Health underlying growth was 10% and reflected strong momentum across all regions. Wealth grew 5%, driven by growth in both investment management and DB Consulting. Our assets under management were $489 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 17% sequentially and up 38% compared to the first quarter of last year. Year-over-year growth was driven by our transactions with Westpac and Vanguard, rebounding capital markets and positive net flows. Career revenue increased 1%, reflecting a tough comparison to a period of strong growth last year, as well as softness in the US. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the first quarter was $789 million, up 13% on an underlying basis from the slow start we had in the first quarter of last year, and reflected strength across all regions. Foreign exchange had very little impact on earnings in the first quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter and a further $0.01 headwind in the second half. Total noteworthy items in the quarter were $49 million. The majority of these items were restructuring costs, mostly related to the program we began in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our other net benefit credit was $67 million in the quarter. For the full year, we expect our other net benefit credit will be approximately $265 million. Interest expense in the first quarter was $159 million, up from $136 million in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting higher levels of debt and higher interest rates. Based on our current forecast, we expect $158 million of interest expense in the second quarter and approximately $620 million for the full year. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter was 23.9% compared with 25% in the first quarter of last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discrete items, the largest of which was the accounting for share-based compensation, similar to a year ago. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 26.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of between 25.5% and 26.5% for 2024. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with total debt of $13.5 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in the second quarter, when $600 million of senior notes mature. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $1.5 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1 billion, and included $354 million for dividends, $347 million for acquisitions, and $300 million for share repurchases. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4.5 billion of capital in 2024 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how our M&A pipeline develops. While there continues to be uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy, we feel good about the momentum in our business and the current environment remains supportive of growth. Overall, our strong start leaves us well-positioned for another good year in 2024. Based on our outlook today, for the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or better underlying growth, margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to John.
John Doyle: Thank you, Mark. Andrew, we are ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: Certainly. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is just on the Marsh growth. John, I caught what you said on the global pricing index, which moved down or decelerated a little bit to 1% from 2% last quarter. But the Marsh organic growth accelerated to 8% this quarter from 6% last quarter. So, I'm hoping you can help me bridge the gap between accelerating growth and the decelerating pricing.
John Doyle: Thanks, David, for the question, and good morning. We work very hard not to be an index on P&C pricing, right? It's an element. It's a macro factor that obviously does have some impact. But less than half of Marsh's revenue is exposed to P&C pricing. What I would also say to you is that where we're most exposed to commission is in the middle-market. Our index skews to larger account data. Pricing is up a bit more in the middle-market than it is in the large account segment, and typically is less cyclical than what you see in the large account market. But I want to just talk about growth overall. I was very pleased with the start to the year, 9% on top of 9% last year and accelerated growth from the fourth quarter of 7%, as I mentioned. Marsh, Mercer and Oliver Wyman all had accelerated growth from the fourth quarter. The macros continue to be supportive, David. Solid GDP growth in most major markets, although it's under a bit of pressure. Inflation and interest rates remain elevated. There's tight labor markets, as I said before, rising healthcare cost. The overall cost of risk continues to increase. And demand remains very strong. Not long out of the pandemic, of course, we've got a couple of global wars happening, supply chain stress. Our clients are showing broader risk awareness. We're talking to them about that and really trying to help them find better balance between resilience and efficiency. And we continue to invest through this cycle, right? I talked about a couple of the acquisitions we did. We're improving our mix of business as well. We sold some admin businesses at Mercer in the quarter. And I'm very, very pleased with how our colleagues are executing, too. We've been working on our client engagement model and improving that, continue to invest in sales operations. And as I've talked about, over the course of the last year, we're collaborating more than ever. It starts with the talent that we have. We have the best talent in the markets that we operate in. We're, of course, not immune to macros, including pricing on some level, but we're a resilient business and we're quite excited about 2024. Do you have a follow-up?
David Motemaden: I do. And thanks for that answer, that's helpful. I guess, just specifically zeroing in on the US and Canada within Marsh, that had a nice acceleration in the quarter. Could you talk about the drivers specifically for that business? Was it middle-market, was it your capital markets activity coming back and sort of your outlook on the sustainability, further recovery and growth there?
John Doyle: Sure, yeah. Marsh in the US got off to a terrific start, US and Canada, I would point out. And Martin, maybe you could give David a little bit more color.
Martin South: Yeah. It wasn't just the US and Canada, it was great balanced growth across the business. But I'll dig into the US a little bit and give you some color on some of the drivers of growth there. And it's really been a product of a lot of work in the last few years to get where we are. So, the overall growth of 8%, our businesses -- the mid-market business, MMA, had a terrific start to the year. The growth in that business is driven both by renewal and fantastic new business. Victor, our MGA business, rebounded, has a great performance, very strong performance in Canada. [Just they] (ph) had a tough year last year, it bounced back and the core business in the US grew nicely. So, very good. The drivers really, particularly in the specialty areas, construction was very strong in the first quarter. Our MMB business was strong. Our advisory business in the US was very strong as part of the risk advisor of the future to the tip of the spear and makes our relationship much stickier. So, our renewal growth was good. And our loss business rate was down. So, we feel very good about all the areas that we've been focusing on, about client relationship, specialization, industry focus advisory, all these things are the drivers for growth. So, we feel very good about things.
John Doyle: Thanks, Martin. David, I would add, it wasn't a bang-out quarter in terms of M&A activity in our transaction risk business, but it's a smaller part of our -- smaller part of our business now. It's a little feedback there. It's a smaller part of our business after the slowdown. So, the impact was less. But we did see some volume in M&A activity pick up during the quarter, which of course is encouraging. So, thank you for your questions. Andrew, next question, please.
Operator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.
Jimmy Bhullar: Good morning. So, I was wondering if you could just elaborate on the comments John had on the reinsurance market. And it seems like things -- the market is less tight than it was over the past year. But what are you seeing in terms of buyer behavior? Are cedents trying to buy more, given that pricing has come in a little bit, or are they trying to save money and keep sort of coverage levels consistent with what they've had in the past year?
John Doyle: Sure, Jimmy. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll elaborate a little bit on some of my prepared remarks and then ask Dean to talk a bit about the reinsurance market. But I think both markets continue to stabilize on average in the quarter. And again, I would remind everyone it's a collection of markets, not a single market. That stabilization is good for our clients. And in some cases, a better market has led to increased demand in both insurance and reinsurance. I would also point out that in recent years, we've had higher premium growth in the captives that we manage at Marsh compared to the premium flow into the traditional market. That may change a bit now, we'll see as markets stabilize and our clients can adjust to what the market looks like going forward. I mentioned earlier our index skews to major accounts. So, pricing in the middle-market continues to move up a bit more than the data points I mentioned earlier. But I would also say that insurers and reinsurers are cautious about that rising cost-of-risk environment that I mentioned as well. And so, while again, a stabilizing market is better for our clients overall, I don't expect that relative stability to change anytime soon given some of the rising cost of risk issues that the insurance community is confronting. So, Dean, maybe you can talk a little bit more about what's happening in reinsurance.
Dean Klisura: Yeah. Thanks, John. And Jimmy, I'll give you a little bit more color on the April 1 reinsurance renewal, that would be helpful. As John noted, we saw a continuation of market conditions that we experienced at January 1. And as John noted, market conditions are stable, but we're definitely seeing increased client demand to provide additional property cat limit, particularly at the top end of programs. That was very pronounced throughout the first quarter at 1/1 through the quarter. And certainly that trend continued on April 1. Strong capital inflows into the reinsurance market, driven by strong reinsurer returns, double-digit returns in 2023. We talked about last quarter on the call, reinsurer appetite has increased for property cat. There is an inflow of capital and capacity. Competition at the top end of programs, it's been good for both buyers and sellers in the marketplace. Specifically to property cat, in the US, at April 1, as I said, capacity was strong. As John noted, the market was generally flat to down incrementally for clients without cat losses. Accounts with cat losses saw 10% to 20% kind of rate increases. But keep in mind, we give you rate-adjusted figures. But when you factor in inflation, exposure growth, value growth, premiums on these cat programs are still increasing year-over-year. It continues to be a tailwind for Guy Carpenter in the marketplace. And as I said, there's a lot of competition for cat business. US casualty, as John noted, was challenging, just as challenging on April 1 as it was at the January 1 renewal. Reinsurers are exerting pressure on pricing in terms and conditions. Ceding commissions are facing downward pressure from reinsurers on certain quota-share contracts, particularly financial lines, which Martin has talked about in the past. Excess-of-loss contracts are seeing rate increases across the board, in some cases, double-digit. However, there was adequate casualty capacity in the marketplace at April 1, and all of the programs that we placed got completed in full. But I would balance that against continued reinsurer concern with the adverse development, driven by social inflation and increasing loss cost trends. I think that's a good summary of where we were in the US market. Just a note on Japan. Big April 1 cat date in Japan, a very orderly market, sufficient capacity, many cat programs were oversubscribed. We didn't observe any structural changes. Attachment points stayed where they were from a year ago. And again, it was a market that was down on average 5% from a rating perspective, and we didn't really observe any rate impact from the January earthquake in Japan. Overall, a very orderly market at April 1 in Japan.
John Doyle: Terrific, Dean. Thank you. Jimmy, do you have a follow-up?
Jimmy Bhullar: [Technical Difficulty] income, it was flat sequentially and lower than 3Q. I'm assuming that's more seasonality. But if you could just talk about your expectation for that given where short-term rates are currently?
John Doyle: Mark, you want to jump on that one?
Mark McGivney: Yeah. Jimmy, there is a little season, as you pointed out. There is a little -- tends to be a little seasonality in our fiduciary balances. Q1 and Q4 tend to be seasonal lows modestly. So that would explain that. In terms of outlook, we'll see what happens to the rate environment. The interest -- our fiduciary interest income is going to be a function of balances and rates, and we've got about $11.5 billion of balances. So, depending on what you want to assume for the trajectory of rates, the math is pretty straightforward.
John Doyle: Thank you, Mark. And thank you, Jimmy. Andrew, next question, please.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. Good morning. My first question was on the margin guidance. You guys said more margin expansion in the back half of the year. What's driving that? Is there just more investment in the first half, more savings falling in the second half, or something else that's driving the seasonality within the margin expansion this year?
John Doyle: Good morning, Elyse. We expect again good margin expansion in 2024. As you pointed out, Mark noted, we expect the second half to be better than the first half. We have some expected headwinds, not really seasonality, but really driven from a higher [merit pool] (ph) a year ago, some acquisition-related costs, and some higher reimbursable expenses. But I want to remind everybody not to focus on any one particular quarter. Again, margin is an outcome of really how we run the business, and it's not a primary objective of ours. Again, having said that, we see opportunity for margin improvement, continued margin improvement. But we're going to continue to make attractive investments to support the medium to long-term growth of the business. We have a number of different efforts underway, ongoing workflow and automation efforts at Marsh, Mercer and Guy Carpenter. And we continue to press for opportunities to improve efficiency at the intersections of our businesses as well. So, we see opportunity. And as we pointed out, we expect the second half to be better than the first. Do you have a follow-up, Elyse?
Elyse Greenspan: Yes, thanks. And then my second question, Marsh recently launched its wholesale venture Victor Access. I know it's early days, but what was the impetus for this strategy? And is there any reason why the majority of the wholesale risk currently placed by Marsh with third-party wholesalers couldn't potentially be internalized through Victor over time?
John Doyle: So, let me be clear, Elyse, we're not looking to build a third-party wholesale business. There's obviously been considerable growth in the wholesaler to E&S market over the course of the last several years. We want to bring the best solutions in the marketplace to our clients. Generally, we're preferring admitted solutions for our clients. Not that there aren't good things that happen in the E&S market. Of course, there are, and innovation is one of the areas where the E&S market is important. But we want to access as much of that E&S market directly. We actually access most of our E&S market solutions directly today. But we want to continue to press and make sure that we can access as much of that market directly. So, it's client-driven, It's about us managing the client outcomes, client experiences, really as directly as possible. Having said that, we'll continue to use wholesalers for niche expertise. They serve us very well and our clients very well. In those cases, they also have strong program businesses as well. So, anyway, that's what it's about. It's just, again, making sure we can directly access as much capital directly as possible for our clients. Thank you for that. Andrew, next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James.
Greg Peters: Good morning, everyone. I'd like to pivot to -- for the first question, pivot to the Consulting business, which had a nice quarter. I'm wondering if you can provide some additional color around how the different pieces are moving. I know some of the management consultants have pre-announced that they're going to be cutting staff this year. Not really seeing any signs of weakness in your pipeline, but maybe you could give us some color, because forecasting this out seems to be a little bit of a black box?
John Doyle: Okay. Thanks, Greg. Yeah, we are very pleased with the start to the year. As you recall, of course, Oliver Wyman had a slow start to the year in 2023, had a nice year overall of growth. There's going to be a bit more volatility to revenue growth at Oliver Wyman, but we also expect better growth on average from Oliver Wyman over the medium to longer term. Nick, maybe you can share with Greg some color on demand in the first quarter.
Nick Studer: Thank you, John, and thank you, Greg. Yeah, 13% was a very pleasing start to the year, it makes a marvelous headline, and we're very, very proud of a good start on what, as you noted, is a tough environment for many in our profession. John has already given the caution about taking the two-year view. We also probably benefited from a few little timing benefits of things that might have shown up in Q2, might have shown up in Q1. And we still very much give guidance through the cycle. This should be a mid-to-high single-digit business. And you noted the sort of forecasting it out is a tricky challenge. That is true because we have a relatively short backlog. The nature of our work is such that when clients need assistance, they need it quickly. And so, we are always ready to move very, very nimbly. To give you a little bit more color, we grew pretty strongly across all the four regions of our management consulting business and our economic research business, NERA, also grew very strongly, fastest in the Middle East, but in the double-digits or very close to double-digits in all three of the other major regions we have. And sectorally, it was also fairly broadly spread. Our communications media and technology team grew well, healthcare grew well, banking seeing a rebound in private capital work, which I've noted on previous calls, has been pretty robust even in the face of obviously a very much lower deal market, but our work on portfolio company performance has helped us there. But insurance also growing, and quite broadly across the capabilities that we bring to bear as well. So, we think we're in a good position. We're very confident we gained share over the last few years, but it's a tough consulting environment. And our pipeline indicates that mid-to-high single-digit growth environment, growth forecast, is how we think about this business through the cycle.
John Doyle: Thank you, Nick. That's very helpful. And Greg, maybe I'll ask Pat Tomlinson also to share some thoughts just on the first quarter at Mercer, given our consulting operations there. And Pat, while you have the floor, as I mentioned, obviously, you're joining this call for the first time. Maybe you could talk a bit about your priorities at Mercer.
Pat Tomlinson: Sure. Thanks, John. Yes, we are pleased with our Q1 2024 underlying growth, as mentioned earlier, of 6%. It was our 12th consecutive quarter with 5% or more growth, especially the breadth across the practices. Health, another impressive quarter with 10% growth in Q1. That growth was really [Technical Difficulty] double-digit growth nearly across all regions. And it comes on the back of investments in hiring new talent, focus on thought leadership, creating digital tools and really focusing in on client segmentation, trying to match client healthcare needs, based upon industry segment size with the innovative and adaptive solutions that we have. So, really trying to meet clients where they are. We certainly benefited from strong retention. We had good renewal growth. Insurer revenue and medical cost inflation has an impact there. We see significant demand for digital solutions and the innovative benefits that are kind of underscoring the value that we're providing to clients. If I pivot over to wealth, we grew 5% in Q1. There was good, balanced, equally strong performance in [DB&A] (ph) and IMS. We see DB plans funding statuses continue to benefit from elevated interest rates that's driving an increase in risk transfer over the last couple of years, as well as we have some regulatory requirements and demands that are creating some project work. If you add in some capital -- some volatile capital markets, it's driving strong demand for both our actuarial and our investment solutions business. Speaking of investment solutions, in OCIO, we benefited from some transactions in Westpac and Vanguard, Mark mentioned that earlier, but also good net new inflows and capital markets provided us some revenue lift in Q1. From a career perspective, growth was muted to 1% for the quarter, but we're following a period of strong growth over the past several years, including a challenging 12% comparable last year. The growth was strong in international, is very broad across all practices and regions. We did see, as was mentioned, some softness in US career, specifically in rewards in the transformation space, as I would say, clients are starting to navigate some of the macro conditions, right? So, let me highlight the career practices coming off that very long period of high growth. As I mentioned, double-digits in -- for the past eight quarters, driven in large part, I would say, by inflation and employee attrition. If we all remember the great resignation back coming out of the pandemic, which drove a lot of labor shortages and really created a lot of demand for projects with clients as they were trying to think about the rewards and how to pay people to keep them retained, the skills that they might need if they had to pivot, because they didn't have the right resources, and also starting to think about transformation as they were having less resources to work with, and there was innovation in technology, as we've all talked about AI, in the past and helping clients through those. So certainly, I think from that perspective, we feel good that there's good breadth of our solutions and demand in the market as we go ahead and fill those needs. John quickly asked me to talk a little bit about how I think about the business and the priorities too. So, obviously, my first call. On April 1, I got to step in and begin this opportunity of a lifetime leading Mercer and our 21,000 colleagues from around the world, as we are focused on creating brighter futures for our clients and for their people. I am extremely humbled and honored to be the CEO of this fantastic firm. And personally, I really want to thank Martine Ferland for a very smooth transition and for the growth momentum and culture that she helped create here. Priority-wise, I want to accelerate that momentum. From the impact that we're having to clients to the fantastic careers we build for colleagues here, the collaboration amongst our colleagues across Marsh McLennan, we can leverage new technologies, and we perform really purpose-driven work, and can have a positive impact on our communities as well. I think we're very well-positioned, as we've been repositioning ourselves over the last several years, reshaping our portfolio. Mark mentioned the divestitures. We've been divesting admin practices. We've been building capabilities and reach and global benefits in OCIO. We've been accelerating acquisitions and we're really just creating more value for clients at scale. And that's what we've been focused in on. So, I'm very optimistic about our future.
John Doyle: Thank you, Pat. We're excited to have you at this table. Greg, do you have a follow-up?
Greg Peters: I do. Thanks for the detail on that answer. I want to pivot to M&A. And specifically, Mark, I think you mentioned the interest expense outlook for the company and we note the higher interest rate cost of the debt that's being issued versus that which is being paid off. So, I'm curious if there's been any follow-through on those higher costs in the terms of valuation of transactions that you're looking at. And, I'm also curious if there's any valuation difference between larger properties versus smaller properties that you're looking at in the M&A market. Thank you.
John Doyle: Yeah. Thanks, Greg. What I would say is we remain quite active in the market. There's a good -- we have a good strong pipeline, as I've talked about in the past, we have an excellent reputation in that marketplace as being a good owner as well. So, we're excited about the deals we did in the first quarter. And again, we're going to continue to remain active in the market. I think valuations have remained stubbornly high, I would say, on the other side of things. And while we might expect that for top-quality assets, I would also point out that some lesser-quality assets have traded at some very, very high multiples of late. And so, we're going to be picky. We're looking for well-led businesses with real strong growth fundamentals that make us better and are a good cultural fit for our organization. We've been very successful at it. And again, as Mark pointed out, we expect to continue to deploy capital in the market going forward. Thank you, Greg. Andrew, next question, please.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.
Michael Zaremski: Hey, great. Good morning. Probably for Mark on the margins and the expense bucket. If I look over the last year-plus, the margin improvements come much more so from the general and other bucket, rather than comp and ben. It looks like that it flipped a little bit that relationship this quarter, if I'm correct. Anything changing there, given the expense management programs, or just in terms of how we should think about where the margin improvement is coming from on a go-forward basis?
John Doyle: Thanks, Mike. Mark, you want to...
Mark McGivney: Yeah, I think it's a great point that you're making and I think it reflects the strategy of the company. We've said we continually invest in positioning ourselves for the future. And over the last several years, we've talked about the heavy investments we've made organically in talent. And so, I think we've done a terrific job of really being thoughtful about all of our other operating expenses, functional costs, how we're leveraging things across the firm, T&E. Really some of the gains we made in the pandemic, we've harvested them. So, as you point out, a lot of our margin expansion over the last five years has come from being really disciplined on things far away from the client and investing heavily in client-facing talent. And so, I think that is a factor in our growth. And I think also as we look forward, there's going to be leverage in those investments, which is why we're optimistic about margins going forward.
John Doyle: Thank you. Mike, do you have a follow-up?
Michael Zaremski: Yeah, a quick follow-up. And I know you gave a lot of commentary on kind of commercial primary insurance pricing power, you told us the Marsh Index declined a bit. Just curious if you can offer any more context. 1% kind of feels like a soft market number. What is it -- are you seeing just returns on behalf of your career partners being kind of excellent that's kind of driving the pricing power downwards in light of kind of what still seems like inflationary trends, or just any more color there on kind of what's causing the decel? I know you gave us by-line commentary. So, I don't know if there's a lot more to add.
John Doyle: Yeah. Mike, I would say that, it doesn't feel like a soft market to our clients after five years of price increases. And as I noted, our index skews to larger accounts and where there's a bit more volatility, typically, throughout the cycle. I expect cycles to be shorter and narrower than what they've been in the past, right? There's better data, better technology on the underwriting front. Capital moves so much more quickly in and out. That's part of the E&S market dynamic that you all have observed over the course of the last several years. So, I expect kind of more relative stability. And from time to time, of course, certain areas of risk, things will change in some meaningful way and that will maybe bounce a particular product outside of a normal cycle. Insurer and reinsurer underwriting results have improved in the aggregate over the course of the last couple of years. And I think most feel good about how their book -- how their portfolios are positioned. It's not all one result, of course. We saw some reserve additions in the fourth quarter results overall. And as I mentioned on our call in the first quarter, the great unknown is casualty loss costs, right? There's lots of emerging data that's troubling for our entire ecosystem, for our client, and it contributes to that rising cost of risk that I mentioned earlier. I maybe should also point out, and Dean touched on this a little bit that our index adjusts for limit, exposure, attachment point, and it includes new business, right? You see some other indices that are out in the market that don't necessarily adjust for all of those factors. And then maybe the last point, Mike, that I would make is that, that number doesn't necessarily correlate directly with what premium growth is in the market, right, because at the end of the day, I mean, it might be at -- you might have less of an increase, you might have certain clients buying more. I think that's most prevalent in the reinsurance market at the moment, but we're seeing that in some cases at Marsh as well, where clients again having adjusted to the new market pricing and new market equilibrium has led to a higher level of demand for coverage from our clients. So, anyway, I hope that's helpful. Andrew, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning. Two questions on Marsh and the market environment you're seeing there. And I think the first one maybe ties well to your last comments, John. Are you surprised to see casualty rates only up 3% just given the loss trends? I guess I'd love to hear your views both as the CEO of Marsh but also maybe as a former underwriter.
John Doyle: It's a -- I actually -- it's very, very hard right now. As I mentioned earlier, there's some troubling data points, right? And thrown in the mix of the last several accident years, of course, a couple of years of the impact of the pandemic, right? And so, just on the clients where we help them, larger clients, with big risk management programs that have a level of frequency, it's very, very difficult to project where loss costs are. But as I said, the underwriting community is better than it's ever been. They have better data, better technology. But there, again, are some troubling signs. It's not just increased frequency. It's not just kind of nuclear verdicts, that term gets kind of thrown around or even some of the bigger settlements. There's a frequency of larger events. See the Francis Scott Key Bridge as an example, that will be a big loss in the market, maybe not as much a casualty loss, but a big loss in the market. But even in like commercial auto, and you've certainly seen that play out in the personal lines auto market, just kind of more frequency type events just costing more to get resolved. And so, we're putting our efforts to helping our clients think through how to better run off liabilities that they assume and even transfer into the market. And the insurers are investing quite a bit in their claims capabilities as well to try to get ahead of this. But I think we're all pointing to again some flashing yellow signals out there about the rising costs overall. Do you have a follow-up?
Yaron Kinar: Yes, I do. And thanks for the color there. So, in Marsh, organic, obviously, was strong and then we certainly saw a very nice result in US and Canada. I guess the only place I could maybe poke a little bit if I were to try would be Asia Pacific where we saw a step down. Is that -- is there a timing issue there with some one-offs? I know you had a very, very strong 1Q '23 there. But anything you could point to in terms of the organic results in Asia Pacific would be helpful.
John Doyle: Yeah, I don't -- no one-offs or major issues there, just on top of a couple of years of very, very good comps and strong growth. We love how we're positioned in Asia, big protection gaps throughout Asia. We have really strong country -- in-country operations all throughout the region. So, we're not just a regional center. We're in-country and working very, very closely with our clients there. As we've said to you in the past, I wouldn't look at any one particular quarter. And again, it's on top of what's been some outstanding growth in Asia over the last couple of years. So, we feel good about where we're headed in Asia overall. Andrew, next question, please.
Operator: Certainly. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Great. Thanks. I was hoping to discuss the competitive environment in RIS maybe from two perspectives. First, I'm wondering whether there is a difference in the market share gain potential when you're in a rising rate environment and the enormously fragmented brokerage world includes a lot of companies that just don't have the resources to help clients manage higher insurance costs as successfully as a company with Marsh's resources. How much of a difference does that make?
John Doyle: It's a good question, Meyer. We're very, very focused on trying to bring scale benefits to our -- well, to all of our key stakeholders, right, including our colleagues, right? We want them -- when they work here, we want them to feel like they have nearly 90,000 folks helping support them with learning and development, data and analytics, market access that you might not have, should you choose to work somewhere else in our industry. So, we certainly think about it from the colleague perspective, we think about it from the client perspective, and we think about it from an investor point of view as well. What I would say, from a client perspective, broadly speaking, again, and this is maybe a bit more upmarket than some of the fragmented segments that you talked about before. Our clients are more risk aware than they've been in the past. I think we have had a role to play in that in trying to make them more risk aware of some meta risks. And again, recent events have certainly helped heighten that. But it's incumbent upon us to bring those scale benefits to the market. And not just scale benefits in terms of data analytics or market access, but different types of solutions. I mentioned earlier, our captive business. We're the largest captive manager in the world, and that's been a meaningful outlet for our clients to manage risk and the rising rate environment over the course of the last several years. So, yes, scale matters. I would also tell you that it plays a role for some of the sellers in the market as well as we talk through with potential M&A targets, why they may look to sell at the moment at times. It's regarding scale type -- scaled-up-type capabilities that we have that are difficult for them to replicate. And so, as I said earlier, we're looking for well led businesses with really solid growth fundamentals, but we know we can make them better too. And that's the exciting part for us. Do you have a follow-up?
Meyer Shields: I do, but I want to thank you for that. That was very thorough. When we look at the parts of the brokerage market that are more concentrated here, I guess I'm thinking reinsurance or Fortune 100-type accounts, in your view, is the competitive -- are competitors fighting at full strength? Are they all -- is competition right now as intense as it normally is, or any differences from longer-term norms?
John Doyle: No, it's -- I mean, in both of the segments you mentioned, it is a highly competitive market, and we love competition. There's nothing that gets me more fired up than getting out in front of clients and, of course, winning ultimately. And our team is the same way. We're passionate about the value that we try to deliver to our clients. And so, as I mentioned earlier, we're collaborating more than ever. And in those particular segments you mentioned, I think it's been particularly meaningful over the course of the last year or so, our efforts to bring a broader set of capabilities to that client set. But no, it's a very, very competitive market and we welcome it. It makes us better. Thanks, Meyer. Andrew, next question? And maybe the last one.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Cox: Hey, thanks. In the prepared remarks, there were some comments on healthcare costs continuing to rise. I was hoping you guys could talk about what you're seeing there and maybe parts of the business, maybe between brokerage and consulting that are generating the strongest organic growth in that 10% organic in health.
John Doyle: Sure. Thank you, Robert. Healthcare and the healthcare industry is a big part of our business overall. And I don't think it's any secret that medical inflation and healthcare-related cost inflation is a major pressure point for our clients in many markets really around the world. It's been a big driver of growth for us, and we continue to invest in it. I talked about in my prepared remarks some of the collaboration between Marsh and Mercer to try to bring some sort of relief to an angle of cost pressure in that marketplace. But Pat, maybe you could talk about the growth we're seeing and some of the cost inflation as well.
Pat Tomlinson: Sure. So, the way that healthcare inflation impacts the business varies based upon the area of the world that we're in. In certain areas of the world where predominantly fee based, it's more large market that would predominantly be from a Mercer perspective inside like the US and some of our more mature larger markets. And then, in a lot of the markets, we are a little bit more brokerage-based to where it's based that way. But let me be clear, even the spots where we're fixed fee, healthcare inflation drives significant increased cost to clients. So, it does create a lot of -- it creates demand for work for us, a lot of project work. So, we will see projects out of that healthcare inflation, it's not necessarily directly driven that way. And even if there's healthcare inflation in the other areas where it's brokerage, it's not a linear type activity from a commission perspective because we're -- once that cost is flowing through to the client P&L, we're always out there doing plan redesign for a client to help make sure that that full cost of healthcare inflation is not flowing through their P&L, right, because they really don't control -- that's one of the larger costs that they don't control themselves based upon the activity that they've had. So that's really where a lot of the inflation helps us. Part of it is increased activity and project work. Occasionally it does create higher rates that flows through in brokerage, but many times those higher rates, we're still doing plan design with the client to try and mitigate the impact that is going to have on the client P&L even in a spot where it's straight commission based brokerage, we're trying to mitigate those costs.
John Doyle: So, rising health and benefit costs in a tight labor market, again, is a pressure point. And another example of where, again, we can bring scale and a broader set of capabilities to the market that our clients appreciate. Do you have a follow-up, Robert?
Robert Cox: Yeah, very helpful. Thank you. Maybe just last question. On the wealth segment, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think last year, probably, the pension business was growing stronger than your investment business. Did that occur as well in the first quarter here or were both of them kind of similar to the 5% organic growth that was achieved in well?
John Doyle: Yeah, we had good solid growth across investment management and defined benefits. As Pat mentioned, our DB business and this period of elevated interest rates have seen a bit more growth than we expected over the course of the last couple of years, but good growth in our OCIO business and our broader set of consulting capabilities inside of our investment business. So, yes, we felt good about that. Thank you, Robert. Andrew?
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan, for any closing remarks.
John Doyle: All right. Thank you, Andrew. And I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. Thank you all very much, and I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-01-25 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh McLennan's earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. Fourth Quarter 2023 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at Marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn this over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.
John Doyle: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO, and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh, Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter, Martine Ferland of Mercer, and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, head of Investor Relations.  2023 was an outstanding year for Marsh McLennan. Total revenue grew 10% to $22.7 billion. We generated 9% underlying revenue growth, continuing our best period of growth in more than two decades, with each of our businesses delivering strong results. Adjusted operating income grew 17% to $5.6 billion. This on top of 11% growth in 2022. Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points, marking the 16th consecutive year we've reported margin expansion, and adjusted EPS grew 17%. We invested $1.6 billion in acquisitions that added to our talent, capabilities, and scale. This was our largest year for acquisitions in nearly two decades, aside from 2019 when we acquired JLT. Our acquisition of Graham expanded MMA’s mid-Atlantic presence, Honan’s strength in our Australian middle market business, and our transaction with Westpac created one of Australia's most competitive super funds. At the same time, we continued to optimize our portfolio, with the sale of two administration businesses at Mercer, which closed on January 1, 2024, and we delivered significant capital return to shareholders, raising our dividend by 20%, and completing $1.15 billion of share repurchases. I'm proud of what our team achieved in 2023. Our colleagues executed on key initiatives and generated value for clients and shareholders.  Our performance reflects execution of a well-defined strategy, which includes building a culture that attracts and retains top talent, strengthening our capabilities through organic and inorganic investment, positioning ourselves in segments and geographies with attractive growth and margin profiles, leveraging data insights and innovation to support clients in managing uncertainty and finding new opportunities, and delivering the power of Marsh McLennan’s perspective to help clients thrive. I just returned from the World Economic Forum where geopolitical, economic, climate, technology, and social risks were all very much top of mind for business and government leaders. Marsh McLennan is uniquely positioned to help clients manage the broad range of outcomes they're confronting from these issues. The launch of the Unity facility with Ukraine in November is a great example. Marsh, Oliver Wyman, and Guy Carpenter, came together to create an innovative insurance solution through a public-private partnership. Unity is now providing access to affordable war risk insurance for grain shipments in the Black Sea. The Ukrainian government's ambition is for the facility to enable nearly 1,000 shipments annually, helping to support their economy and global food security. Launching this facility was a proud moment for us, and I can't think of a better example of our purpose, our capabilities, and our impact in action. In so many ways, Marsh McLennan is well positioned to address today's challenges, and we are only just beginning to harness our combined capabilities, which are a distinct advantage. We are inspired by the possibilities, and consider it a privilege to do this important work. Our business strategy is complemented by a balanced approach to expense and capital management. We focus on generating consistent, strong earnings growth, and have a discipline of growing revenue faster than expenses. Our approach to capital allocation delivers results today, while investing to sustain growth in the future. And we are implementing new ways to operate, reduce complexity, and organize for impact. The strong value propositions of our individual businesses, the upside from bringing our collective strength to clients, and our restructuring actions, position us well for 2024. Looking to the year ahead, we continue to see a complex macro environment. Major economies continue to face the risk of recession, but moderating inflation and the possibility of easing interest rates make a soft landing more likely. The geopolitical situation remains unsettled, with multiple wars, escalating conflict throughout the Middle East, and rising tension in the South China Sea. Despite these challenges, we continue to believe there are factors that are supportive of growth in our business. Nominal GDP expectations for 2024 remain healthy for our major markets. While inflation has moderated, it is still elevated, and tight labor markets and supply chain challenges persist. Continued low unemployment and sustained payroll growth, support demand in health and benefits and exposure unit growth in workers' compensation. The cost of risk continues to increase as insurers account for rising frequency and severity of catastrophe losses, the risks of social inflation, and higher reinsurance costs. Healthcare costs, driven in part by the rising cost of prescription drugs, accelerated in 2023, and are expected to remain elevated. And while short-term interest rates could ease, they remain at the highest level since the financial crisis. As we've stated before, we have a track record of resilience and performance across economic cycles. Now, let me turn to insurance and reinsurance market conditions. Primary insurance rates increased for the 25th consecutive quarter, with the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index up 2% overall, compared to a 3% increase in the third quarter. Property rates increased 6% versus 7% in the third quarter, and casualty pricing continued to be up low single-digits. Workers' compensation decreased slightly, while financial and professional liability rates were down mid-single-digits. Cyber pricing decreased modestly after several years of increases. In reinsurance, the January 1 renewals reflected a market with more balanced trading conditions than a year ago. As we expected, underwriting discipline continued, but the market was more responsive to client objectives. Capacity was generally adequate, and we saw increased demand from clients. In global property cat reinsurance, accounts without losses saw rates up modestly, while loss-impacted accounts increase between 10% and 30%. Casualty programs faced more scrutiny this year, with pressure on pro-rata seating commissions, and excess of loss pricing. However, casualty capacity was adequate. As always, we're helping our clients navigate these dynamic market conditions.  Now, let me briefly turn to our fourth quarter financial performance, which Mark will cover in detail. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.68, which is up 14% versus a year ago. Revenue grew 7% on an underlying basis, with 8% growth in RIS, and 7% in consulting. Overall, in the fourth quarter, we had adjusted operating income growth of 16%, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points year-over-year. In summary, 2023 was another outstanding year for Marsh McLennan. All of our businesses delivered, generating excellent revenue and earnings growth. We executed on our strategic initiatives, invested in high quality acquisitions, made the largest dividend increase in 25 years, and made meaningful share repurchases. Looking forward, we are well positioned for 2024. We expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth, margin expansion, and strong adjusted EPS growth. Our outlook assumes current macro conditions persist. However, meaningful uncertainty remains, and the economic backdrop could be materially different than our assumptions.  With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, John, and good morning. Our strong fourth quarter results capped an excellent year. Our consolidated revenue increased 11% in the fourth quarter to $5.6 billion, with underlying growth of 7%. Operating income was $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating income was $1.2 billion, up 16% from a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points to 23.3%. GAAP EPS was $1.52. Adjusted EPS was $1.68, up 14%. Our full year of 2023 results were outstanding. Operating income for the year was $5.3 billion, and adjusted operating income was $5.6 billion, an increase of 17% over 2022. Adjusted EPS grew 17% to $7.99, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points, marking our 16th consecutive year of reported margin expansion. 2023 was also a strong year for capital management. We deployed $4 billion of capital, enhanced our short-term liquidity, raised our quarterly dividend 20%, and saw Moody's upgrade our senior unsecured debt rating to A3.  Looking at risk and insurance services, fourth quarter revenue increased 11% to $3.3 billion, or 8% on an underlying basis. This result marks the 11th consecutive quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth in RIS, and continues the best stretch of growth in two decades. RIS operating income was $753 million in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 15% to $791 million, and our adjusted margin expanded 140 basis points to 27%. For the full year, revenue in RIS was $14.1 billion, representing an increase of 11% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 17% for the year, and our adjusted operating margin in RIS increased 150 basis points to 31.3%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter increased 7% to $2.9 billion, or 6% on an underlying basis. For the full year, revenue at Marsh was $11.4 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 8%. In US and Canada, underlying growth was 5% for the quarter, reflecting solid renewal and new business growth, despite continued headwinds in financial and professional lines. We also saw a headwind of nearly a point from lower flood claims in our MGA business.  For the full year, underlying growth in US and Canada was strong at 7%. In international, underlying growth was 7% in the quarter, with Latin America up 11%, Asia Pacific up 10%, and EMEA up 5%. For the full year, underlying growth in international was excellent at 9%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $252 million, up 9% on an underlying basis, driven by growth across global specialties in most regions. For the year, Guy Carpenter generated $2.3 billion of revenue and 10% underlying growth, our strongest year since 2003. In the consulting segment, fourth quarter revenue was $2.3 billion, up 10% from a year ago, or 7% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $443 million, and adjusted operating income was $480 million, up 18%. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points in the quarter to 21.3%. For the full year, consulting revenue was $8.7 billion, an increase of 7% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income for the year increased 13% to $1.7 billion, and our adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 20.4%.  Mercer's revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, reflecting underlying growth of 5%. This was Mercer's 11th straight quarter of 5% or higher underlying growth, and continues the best run of growth in 15 years. Health grew 9% in the fourth quarter, reflecting strength in employer and government segments, and momentum across all regions. Wealth was up 4%, driven by growth and investment management and DB administration. Our assets under management were $420 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 11% sequentially, and up 22% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Year-over-year growth was driven by our transaction with Westpac, a rebound in capital markets, and positive net flows. Career revenue increased 1%, reflecting tough comparables following a period of strong growth in the reward space. For the year, revenue at Mercer was $5.6 billion, an increase of 7% on an underlying basis, the best result since 2008. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the fourth quarter was 856 million, an increase of 9% on an underlying basis, like strength in Europe and the Middle East. For the full year, Oliver Wyman's revenue was $3.1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 8%.  Adjusted corporate expense was $78 million in the quarter. Foreign exchange had very little impact on earnings in the fourth quarter and was a $0.07 headwind for the full year. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX will have a negligible impact on the first quarter and full year of 2024. Total noteworthy items in the quarter were $90 million, the majority of which related to our restructuring actions, partly offset by a $58 million gain related to a legal settlement. We reported $131 million of total restructuring costs, approximately $113 million of which relates to the program we launched in the fourth quarter of 2022. These charges largely reflect costs related to severance, lease exits, and streamlining our technology environment. We expect total charges under this program of approximately $475 million, and expect total savings of roughly $400 million, of which approximately $230 million was realized in 2023. We expect to realize the bulk of the remaining savings in 2024. To date, we've incurred approximately $440 million of charges under this program. Our other net benefit credit was $59 million in the quarter and $239 million for the full year. For 2024, we currently expect our other net benefit credit will be up slightly. Cash contributions to our global defined benefit plans were $111 million in 2023. We expect a similar amount in 2024. Investment income was a loss of $1 million in the fourth quarter on both a GAAP and adjusted basis, and we aren't currently projecting any investment income in the first quarter of 2024.  Interest expense in the fourth quarter was $151 million, up from $127 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting higher levels of debt and higher interest rates. Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense for the full year 2024 of approximately $625 million, with $159 million in the first quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 25.5%. This compares with 22.9% in the fourth quarter last year, which benefited from favorable discrete items. For the full year 2023, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, compared with 23.5% in 2022. Both periods benefited from favorable discrete items. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of between 25.5% and 26.5% for 2024. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet, we ended the year with total debt of $13.5 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturities are in the first quarter of 2024, when $1 billion of senior notes mature, and in the second quarter when another $600 million of notes come due. Recall that last September we issued $1.6 billion of new debt to fund these maturities. Our cash position at the end of the fourth quarter was $3.4 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1.1 billion, and included $354 million for dividends, $486 million for acquisitions, and $250 million for share repurchases. For the year, uses of cash totaled $4 billion and included $1.3 billion for dividends, $1.6 billion for acquisitions, and $1.15 billion for share repurchases.  I want to take a minute to reiterate our approach to capital management. We have consistently followed a balanced capital management strategy that helps us deliver solid performance in the near term, while investing for sustained growth over the long term. We prioritize investment in our business, both through organic investments and acquisitions. We favor attractive acquisitions over share repurchases, and believe they are the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long term. However, we also recognize that returning capital to shareholders generates meaningful returns for investors over time, and each year we target raising our dividend and reducing our share cap.  Looking ahead to 2024, based on our outlook today, we expect to deploy approximately $4.5 billion of capital across dividends, acquisitions, and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. As John noted, there is significant uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy. However, we feel good about our momentum and position, and despite the uncertainty, there are factors that remain supportive of growth. For 2024, we currently expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth, margin expansion, and strong growth in adjusted EPS.  With that, I'm happy to turn it back to John. 
John Doyle: Thank you, Mark. Andrew, we're ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, earlier this week, we had another insurance broker who's updating their reported EPS metric to back out intangibles. So, that does leave you guys as the only broker peer, right, that doesn't back out intangibles out of your adjusted EPS figure. Have you guys given consideration to moving towards what's become industry common practice?
John Doyle: Good morning, Elyse. Mark, maybe you could comment on that. 
Mark McGivney: Elyse, we don't have any current plans to change our reporting. We do provide amortization and other information that allows you to stack us up against other companies, but we don't plan to change how we report at this point.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks.
John Doyle: You have a follow-up, Elyse?
Elyse Greenspan: And then my second - yes, my second question. I was hoping to get more color on both the US and Canada and EMEA, which did see growth slow in the quarter. I know Mark alluded to one point headwind from lower flood business within the US and Canada. I wasn't sure if there was anything else to point out in the quarter, and also hoping to get similar color on anything one-off within organic growth within EMEA as well.
John Doyle: Sure, Elyse, and I'll make a couple of comments and then ask Martin to jump in. First of all, Marsh had an excellent year of growth at 8% underlying revenue growth for the year, a strong finish to the year. We saw fourth quarter of 2022 have slightly lower underlying growth as well, but we feel like we're very well positioned. Mark made a few comments about the growth in the quarter, but Martin, maybe you could add a little bit more color.
Martin South: Yes, thank you, John. As you said, we had a very good year, with 7% growth this year. And Marsh for the quarter at 5% growth, was also the same as the prior year. MMA had an outstanding performance, driven really by great retention new business. Our M&A pipeline is robust. The US business continued to perform well. There's some headwinds in the capital markets activity and pressure on financial minds, but our advisory business grow - it was partially offset by Canada, which is impacted more by macro headwinds. And of course, we mentioned a lot of flood claims in the MGA business. So, in EMEA, we had an excellent year in EMEA, 9% growth. Q4 was 5% growth. The European business within EMEA is the smallest quarter by some margin. And so, it's susceptible to some slowdown in some of the projects, but we had a very strong year, strong quarter in the Middle East, steady results in the UK. And so, that was really it. Nothing remarkable, strong momentum, we'd expect to be very confident going into next year.
John Doyle: Thanks, Martin. So, Elyse, FINPRO pricing, as Mark mentioned, flood claims and the continued slow M&A environment, all factored in in the US, but again, we feel like we're very well positioned and demand is quite strong for us in in 2024. Operator, next question.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hey, good morning. So, first, just a question on the reinsurance brokerage business. Obviously, prices this year haven't gone up like they did last year. But what have you seen in terms of terms and conditions and buying behavior? Because last year we saw the primaries retain a lot of risk and attachment points went up. Have those come back down or are like sort of terms and structures programs similar to how they were last year?
John Doyle: Yes, thanks for the question, Jimmy. Guy Carpenter just had an excellent year helping clients navigate what was a very, very choppy market in 2023. We certainly began 2024 with a more orderly market, but growth was outstanding, and I feel terrific about how we're positioned to help clients going forward. But Dean, maybe could share a little bit more insight on the market on 1/1.
Dean Klisura: Sure. Thanks, John. And Jimmy, let me give you a little bit more color on the 1/1 renewal in reinsurance. As John stated, we saw a balanced reinsurance market at the January 1st renewal. Overall capacity was adequate for the completion of most programs across products and classes of business. Capacity did increase given rebounding capital in the marketplace and improved reinsurer returns in 2023. We estimate the dedicated reinsurance capital increased double-digit for the 1/1 renewal. Turning to property cat, which I think you're mainly referring to, as John noted, was more consistent trading rhythm than last year. Capacity overall was adequate to cover most non-frequency cat exposed layers. But as John noted, reinsurers held firm on terms and conditions. Attachment points did not come down. So, reinsurers held on what they achieved in 2023, continuing to expose our clients' balance sheets to attritional volatility moving forward. So, that certainly didn't change. But overall, I thought it was a positive renewal. Clients bought more capacity at the top of cat programs. You saw some of those reported in the marketplace. So, clients were able to get more capacity than last year, achieve their objectives, as John noted. John talked about risk-adjusted rate increases. For clients with non-loss impacted portfolios, they saw a range of flat to high single-digit kind of rate increases, but clients with cat losses were in the 10% to 30% rate increase range, right? So, I think that was pretty robust in both kind of the US and European markets. Maybe a minute on casualty as well. In prior calls, we talked a lot about casualty and increased scrutiny of casualty portfolios heading into the 1/1 renewal. Reinsurers have been expressing concerns about adverse loss development now for several quarters and real and social inflation. However, I would say that at 1/1, that pricing movement was more constrained, slightly more muted than we anticipated kind of earlier in the fourth quarter. That said, as John, as John mentioned, there was downward pressure on seating commissions for quota share contracts. And excess of lost contracts saw double-digit rate increases moving forward. But in the casualty renewal, I would say overall capacity was adequate.
John Doyle: Thanks, Dean. Jimmy, I would add, just in both the insurance and reinsurance market, the pace of loss cost inflation in casualty is the great unknown at the moment. We all know it's increasing. We all see mounting evidence of it, but that's the challenge for all of us in the market to sort through at the moment. Do you have a follow-up, Jimmy?
Jimmy Bhullar: Yes. Just on fiduciary investment income. So, it had been increasing at a pretty sharp rate and declined modestly sequentially. Is that a function of just what's happened with interest rates or something to do with fiduciary balances or seasonality or something else?
John Doyle: Sure. Mark, you want to? 
Mark McGivney: Yes. Jimmy, it is seasonality. Our balances tend to have a pattern of seasonality. It results in - Q4 and Q1 tend to be seasonal lows for average balances. So, it's purely a function of that.
John Doyle: Thanks, Jimmy. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.
MichaelZaremski: Good morning. Back to the organic growth commentary, especially on the brokerage side, you’re loud and clear on kind of some of the pluses and minuses. I didn't hear anything about any influence from maybe a diminishing tailwind from some of the excess hires you've made in past years. Is that a dynamic we should be thinking about as we think about 2024 and 2025?
John Doyle: Yes. Thanks, Mike. No, I don't think so. We continue to invest both organically and inorganically, maybe not that at the pace of a few years ago, but that's an important metric for us that we track around how we're driving production capacity in all of our businesses. So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we think the macro environment continues to be supportive of growth in our business. Nominal GDP will drive some growth. Inflation, while easing, is still elevated, tight labor markets. We were just talking about the cost of risk in casualty as well. And as a result of that, we think pricing in the market will maintain - will remain relatively stable as it's been really throughout most of 2023. So, we’re quite optimistic about 2024. Our outlook is positive. I would also say a couple of other things. We're a better business entering 2024. We've been working hard at that. Our mix continues to improve. I talked about that a little bit about some of the divestiture activity, but also the inorganic investment we made. And we'll continue to invest organically in the business as well, and demand remains strong. So, we're excited about 2024.
MichaelZaremski: Understood. And my follow-up, switching gears a little bit to Mercer. In your prepared remarks, I think you made, John, some comments about medical or health inflation. Some of the data points we've seen are - the medical costs for employers should - might accelerate in 2024. Should that have a tailwind or any influence on the health segment specifically? Thanks.
John Doyle: Sure. Health was a terrific story for us in 2023, and helping employers navigate what's a very, very complex and increasing cost environment will be very much on the top of our agenda in 2024 as well. Maybe, Martine, I'll ask you to comment a little bit about how we finished the year and what your outlook is around health for 2024.
Martine Ferland: Yes. Thanks, John, and thanks, Mike, for the question. We're very pleased with the results in health, and we have had a quarter of 9% a year of 10 in overall health, and it comes from all regions, and it comes from many places. Of course, full employment does drive good results there, more people to cover in our employers’ benefit programs. But we also have invested in innovative and adaptive solutions. And medical cost inflation is there, and what it drives for us is a lot of consulting around trying to help clients and their employees control costs by better design, better fit for purpose programs. So, we'll see. There's not a huge portion of our business that is actually directly linked to inflation. We have a lot of fee-based revenue in the business. So, usually, whether there's a lot of inflation or inflation abates a little bit is not a big factor in the overall results. I think it's more around access to healthcare, innovative form of healthcare, like digital health, mental health, good affordability for clients and their employees. That's mostly driving our business results.
John Doyle: Thanks, Martine. Andrew, next question, please.
Operator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I had a question just on Oliver Wyman, and I know a few quarters ago, we spoke about the pipeline that had slowed a little bit, but growth has remained pretty resilient there. I'm wondering if you could just talk about some of the drivers there within Oliver Wyman for organic. And we've seen a few more - a little bit more activity on the life insurance transaction side, just M&A activity. Is that something that's been an outside driver to results?
John Doyle: Yes, thanks, David. Oliver Wyman had a terrific year, and as we all recall, we had a flat start to 2023. So, demand continued to pick up and sales continued to pick up throughout the course of the year, and we had a real strong finish. But Nick, maybe you could share a bit more color on what drove the growth and your outlook a bit.
Nick Studer: Thank you, David, for the question. Yes, 12 months ago, we were coming off a pretty strong year, but we knew the first quarter was going to be tough. And looking back on the year, it was indeed a pretty tough marketplace for many of our competitors and for the industry, and we're very proud of clawing back from that slow start to a strong year. It was pretty wide-based growth. As Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks, our Middle East business grew very strongly, had excellent growth in Europe. We had strong growth in our economic research capabilities, as well as in digital, in finance and risk. Some of our other capabilities grew, our people and organizational performance capability. And I've mentioned a few times that we've been building a restructuring practice. It's still not a big restructuring cycle, but that practice continues to grow very strongly. And across the industry is, again, broad-based growth in the public sector, which is a strong practice for us, particularly in the Middle East. Some good growth in banking. You mentioned life insurance and consolidation. We have a strong insurance practice. We've seen a lot more activity in post-merger integration and M&A across our sectors. And then our transportation and services and our communications media and technology practices also grew strongly. And I think it's off the base of just good hiring, good organic growth, and also some good inorganic growth. We've made a number of acquisitions over the last few years. We announced one which we hope to complete in the next couple of months, and both great partner level hires and M&A are helping fuel that growth as well. So, the business is now 50% bigger than it was three years ago. That scale, that breadth, allows us to play in more places, allows us to help our clients with their big transformative moments.
John Doyle: Thank you, Nick. And David, I would add, Oliver Wyman is just one of the ways in which we can show up in a very, very different way in front of clients and prospects. And so, we have a unique collection of capabilities, certainly with them and the family. Do you have a follow-up, David?
David Motemaden: I do, yes. Thanks for that. Just a bigger picture question. I just sort of look over the last decade or the decade pre-pandemic, Marsh as an enterprise has grown organically in the 3% to 5% range, and we've obviously been well above that over the last three years, including 9% here in 2023. There've been a number of tailwinds, but you guys have also been investing in the business. So, I'm wondering if you think we can sustainably grow above that 3% to 5% organic growth we saw in the decade pre-pandemic as we think about the next several years.
John Doyle: Yes, thanks, David. As I said just a couple of minutes ago, I think we're a better business entering 2024 than we were in 2023. I thought we were an outstanding business leading into 2023, but we've been working hard at being a better growth business for many years now. Part of that's reshaping the mix of business. As we've talked about, investing organically and inorganically. We've spent a lot of time refining our client engagement models and investing in sales operations and technology to support sales. And of course, in 2019, we made the biggest acquisition in our history with JLT. So, we were building up these capabilities going into 2020 when, of course, the pandemic hit. So, I knew we were ready to run coming out of the pandemic. The macro environment, of course, has been supportive since the pandemic. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect the macros to continue to be supportive in in 2024. So, we think we're well positioned. As I mentioned earlier, we expect mid single-digit revenue growth or better. So, we're excited and quite optimistic heading into the year. Operator, next question, please. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Cox: Hey, thanks for taking my question. So, just curious if you could give us some more color on any changes in the middle market operating environment in particular, and anything you guys are thinking about in terms of competitive dynamics as some large peers enter this space in a bigger way.
John Doyle: I think you could ask Aon about NFP. I'm happy to talk about our middle market offering. I believe we have the best-in-class middle market US platform in MMA. It has been 12 years that we've been building our business here in the United States. And we've been building it out methodically and I’m very, very proud of it. We love competition. And so, I'll take our team in the market, but we're excited about our prospects at MMA. And candidly, I think we're just getting started. And when we began this effort 12 years ago, there were 30,000 independent agents in the United States, and today there are 30,000 independent agents in the United States. So, there's much more in front of us. Do you have a follow-up? 
Robert Cox: That's great. Yes. So, just for a follow-up, maybe going back to the health space, I think you guys have discussed how you're largely compensated on a fee per employee basis, and employment growth is much lower than the 9% organic you achieved in the quarter. So, I was just wondering if you could help me understand, is this more consulting, new business opportunities out there? Are you raising fees and maybe is brokerage growing at a similar pace to the headline 9% organic?
John Doyle: Yes. it's I think all of the above, but good sales and a value proposition to clients and prospects that they appreciate very much. I don't know, Martine, do you have anything to add to that? 
Martine Ferland: Yes. Well, first a correction. The large part of our business is actually consulting fees. It's not fees per member, as you mentioned, Robert. So, just to be clear about that. There's a small portion of the business in the US that is fee per participant, but that's the business that we divested. It's more in a (NIM) business. It’s how those businesses are usually paid out. So, the bulk of our business, some of it is based on the commission, but as I said, clients are really trying to control costs. So, there's not a direct link to inflation in premium there, because they would change the attachment point, as my colleagues in reinsurance like to talk about. They would vary the benefit programs, et cetera. And there's a large part that is project-based. And to your point, our growth has been in part full employment because there's much more work to be done to cover the employee population. But there's also a lot of change. High cost of prescription drugs, for example, accessibility through different means, technology coming into the space to help out people choose the right providers, the right programs, and we're there with them helping them design those programs, communicate them to employees, measure them in terms of efficacy, but also cost, et cetera. So, that's what's been - and you know that the health space everywhere is also seeing lots of change, lots of pressure on cost. So, I don't see us being not busy anytime soon. Nothing climbs through that.
John Doyle: Thank you, Martine. Thank you, Robert. Andrew, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Great, thank you. Two quick questions. First, can you give us a sense of the seasonality of the reinsurance acquisition that contributed so much to this quarter's growth?
John Doyle: Mark, maybe you can?
Mark McGivney: Meyer, what you're seeing - I think you're referring to the underlying growth schedule and what looks like a large acquisition in Guy Carpenter, is actually that column is acquisitions, dispositions, and other adjustments. And we had a - in my prepared remarks, I mentioned a legal settlement that we had, a noteworthy item in the quarter. So, that's what's running through that schedule. It wasn't a large - not M&A for Guy Carpenter.
Meyer Shields: Oh, okay. Thank you.
John Doyle: You have a follow-up, Meyer?
Meyer Shields: Yes, a quick one. When you've got the flood claims revenues in last year's I guess US and Canada operations with risk and insurance services, did that have any impact on last year's margins or the year-over-year progress?
John Doyle: Well, we don't report margins by business, but you saw a good margin expansion during the course of the year. And again, our outlook for 2024 is for 17th year in a row to expand margins yet again. So, it wasn't material. We managed through it. There are parts of our business that are lumpy, right? That's why we caution everybody not to get too worked up about growth rates in a particular quarter. And the flood claim activity was largely related to Hurricane Ian-related work that we did at that time last year. Thank you, Meyer. Andrew, next question, please.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith: Hey, thanks, John. Just quickly and kind of following on Rob's question a little bit. If we look at the middle market space, there are some kind of larger competitors of yours that are going through some transitions, be it being acquired, maybe being acquired, not sure, all sorts of stuff. Is that creating maybe another opportunity here for you to kind of ramp up talent acquisition? You obviously were really successful a couple of years ago doing that. Is that opportunity out there you think again?
John Doyle: Yes. Look, Brian, what I would say first and foremost about talent acquisition is that we are very, very focused. I mentioned this in my prepared remarks about building a culture that attracts and retains the best in our work. The way we frame it, and we talk about being at your best at Marsh McLennan, right? How can we - for those that want to commit their career to risk strategy and people-related work, how is it that being at Marsh McLennan, you can be your best? And we frame those programs around learning and development, mobility, various aspects of wellness. And you get to do really purposeful work here. I mentioned the Ukraine work as an example earlier. You get to work with exceptional talent, and it's a collaborative environment and a learning environment. And so, I feel like we have the best talent in our business. I feel like our brand as an employer in the market is very, very strong. It doesn't mean everybody wants to work here. Of course, we're a big company and as we all know, there's lots of things that come with working at a bigger company. But I like how we're positioned. So, M&A, yes. Does it create opportunities for talent acquisition? Much like - we saw a bit of talent breakage when we acquired JLT. Folks sign up for working at a certain place, and when you have that kind of change, it's an opportunity possibly for folks to think through what they want to do going forward. I like how we're positioned in that respect. And then back to your other comment, yes, there are a number of bigger businesses, particularly in the risk space that are likely to change hands over time.
Brian Meredith: Great, thanks. And then I guess my next question, could you talk a little bit about kind of the M&A environment, particularly in the risk business, multiples being paid, what the pipeline kind of looks like there, more competitive, less competitive.
John Doyle: Yes, thanks, Brian. We remain very active in the market. As I said earlier, last year was our biggest year of acquisitions, other than 2019 when we did JLT, over a long period of time. We're very selective. We’re looking for high performing businesses, well led businesses in attractive markets. As I mentioned, we want growth businesses with the ability to grow earnings as well. The three bigger deals that I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we're very excited about Honan in Australia. It gives us really an anchor platform deeper into the middle market in what's a very important and attractive market for us. Graham here in the United States, another step forward for us at MMA and then BT Westpac in Australia, strengthening our wealth business. So, we have a couple of deals that we announced in the later part of last year. Vanguard's OCIO operation, a career business, those will close sometime over the next the next few months. So, we're going to continue to be active. Much like I was talking about our brand as an employer, our brand as a buyer is also quite strong, right? We do what we say we're going to do. And so - and then on valuations, four really attractive assets. Their multiples remain high. And so, anyway, but we'll continue to deploy capital that way. And as Mark mentioned, we'd rather deploy capital on attractive inorganic and organic investment for that matter over share buybacks. But in the course of a year, you never know how things will run. But the pipeline is quite strong at the moment. Thank you, Brian. Andrew, next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with TD Cowen.
Andrew Kligerman: Hey, good morning. John, you talked about the great unknown in terms of loss cost inflation, social inflation. On the flip side, we've seen a few carriers report, and their results have been exceptional. So, I understand that you're kind of projecting out some good pricing, but at what point does that give and take ratio change and we kind of see some softer pricing, and how would that affect Marsh?
John Doyle: So, look, as I've said a couple of times on this call, we've been working very hard at becoming a better growth business. We're not an index on P&C pricing. Of course, we're exposed to it. And just to be clear, I wasn't trying to project higher casualty prices over time. Our job is to get the most efficient risk financing as we can for our clients. But what I can tell you is, it is quite clear that there's stress emerging in casualty. There's no question about it. There are some casualty cats that are out there that are concerning to underwriters and buyers, and we're just seeing greater frequency of mega settlements, and for that matter, even judgements on individual cases. Core inflation, of course, is something that's always a factor in the market. And you see that - you've seen some of that manifest itself in shorter tail lines from carriers. But we're all quite concerned inside of our risk business about where casualty loss costs are headed.
Andrew Kligerman: Thanks for that one. And then my second question is just the stellar growth, underlying growth in Asia Pacific at 10%, LATAM at 11% in risk and insurance services. Question is, what particularly you seeing in those markets that is driving some of that excellent growth? And then underlying that, what is Marsh doing differently from the competitors?
John Doyle: Yes. I mean, we're very proud of our businesses in both of those regions. They've been growth leaders for us over the last several years. I would point out, it's one of the things that JLT brought to us in 2019. We expanded our footprint and brought along much greater distribution in both Latin America and Asia. But Martin, maybe you could talk a little bit more about both of those regions.
Martin South: Yes, as you say, I mean, we’re the clear market leader by some margin in Asia-Pac. There's several factors. We have literally market leadership in every single major geography there. We are able to bring all of our best capabilities from around the world to there. We have great teams, very specialized, a very strong employee benefits business. We have scale. We're able to attract and retain talent in a way - there's just - there's real momentum there. And the same can be said in Latin America. Slightly different economic dynamics, obviously, with Latin America. A big protection gap. A lot of opportunities market leadership in the areas there, and still quite an unconsolidated marketplace. So, we like the fact that we built our businesses organically, so the cultures are strong. There's not much on the M&A pipeline in those markets that we like. We are confident that we can build our businesses organically. And the differentiation of having global service and our global capabilities is really well sought out to by our clients.
John Doyle: Yes, thanks, Andrew, and Martin, for that. We continue to be excited about how we're positioned in those markets. Andrew, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley.
Bob Huang: Hi. I only have one major question. So, this regarding MMA. So, just curious, how much did MMA contribute to the overall revenue for 2023? And as we move into 2024, how should we think about the trajectory for MMA? Is it like, should we continue to expect it to further outgrow the broader business as a whole, or how should we think about just the competitive dynamic overall as well?
John Doyle: So, we obviously don't separately report MMA's results, but it's an important part of our business in the United States, and it continues to perform exceptionally well. We couldn't be more pleased, as I mentioned earlier. And as I also said, I think we're just getting started, right? So, and what I would also say is that the broader Marsh has learned a great deal from MMA about what it takes to win in the middle market. And Martin and the team apply those lessons as we expand in the middle market all over the world and where possible even deploy inorganic investment like we did in in the case of Honan in Australia. But our business at MMA also benefits from being part of Marsh. They're excellent at really mining Marsh for content and capability that can enable them to show up with scale in local markets in a way that really distinguishes themselves from others. So, as I mentioned earlier, we've been methodically building out MMA over the course of the last 12 years piece by piece and A+ asset by A+ asset. And so, we couldn't be more excited, and we think there's a long road ahead of us. Do you have a follow-up, Bob? 
Bob Huang: No, I think I'm good. Thank you.
John Doyle: Okay. Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please.
Operator: One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ward with Citi.
Michael Ward: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Just on the capital deployment target, I think it was up over 10%. I was just wondering if that's a function of the cost savings program rolling off or anything else.
John Doyle: No, but Mark, maybe you could just talk generally about our approach.
Mark McGivney: We had a, if you saw, a strong year of free cash flow generation. We have significant financial flexibility. Our balance sheet is strong. And so, it's just really a reflection of the growth in our outlook for capital - cash generation.
Michael Ward: Okay. And then any kind of update on the progress with synergizing the various business sales efforts together?
John Doyle: Yes, thanks, Mike, for that question. One of the things that I think makes us a better business is we're working better together than we ever have, right? And we have shared with you where we are on the expense side of things, but we're showing up together in front of clients and prospects. As I mentioned earlier, the strength of our individual business propositions will continue to drive the growth of our business overall. But more and more, we can show up in a very, very unique way. And so, we made good progress during 2023. We've certainly learned a great deal. We've done some testing, and we'll continue to refine that. But we have a number of global growth opportunities where we're showing up in front of clients and prospects together. And what we really did was create a framework for our folks in the field. As you'll recall, we appointed Marsh McLennan leaders in each of the regions. And so, a big part of their day is making sure that we're bringing our collective capabilities to market at a local level where it makes sense. So, we continue to be excited about what that'll mean to future growth.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan, for any closing remarks.
John Doyle: Thanks, Andrew, and I want to thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. Thank you all very much, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-19 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh McLennan's earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. Third Quarter 2023 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn this over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.
John Doyle: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President, and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses: Martin South of Marsh, Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter, Martine Ferland of Mercer, and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also, with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. Before I get into our results, I'd like to take a moment to comment on the violent attacks on Israel and the tragic events unfolding in Israel and Gaza. We, along with our colleagues, condemn all acts of terror and violence and reject hatred. Our primary focus is on ensuring the safety and well-being of our colleagues in Tel Aviv and supporting colleagues around the world who have family and friends in Israel and Gaza. We're also supporting our clients as they grapple with the challenges of this conflict. Turning to our third quarter results. I'm very pleased with our performance. We extended our best run of quarterly underlying revenue growth in over two decades and reported significant growth in adjusted EPS. Top-line momentum continued with 10% underlying revenue growth, on top of 8% growth in the third quarter of last year. Adjusted operating income grew 24% versus a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted EPS grew 33%, and we completed $300 million of share repurchases during the quarter. These results reflect our consistent focus on delivering in the near term, while investing for sustained growth over the long term. We are seeing the benefit of investments we've made in our talent and capabilities, and we continue to see opportunities to add high-quality acquisitions. During the third quarter, we announced two significant transactions. In early August, Marsh McLennan Agency acquired Graham Company, a top 100 U.S. insurance and benefits broker and risk management consultancy with 215 employees and over $70 million in revenue. Graham will provide significant business insurance and employee benefits expertise for MMA's clients in the Mid-Atlantic. This acquisition is another example of us attracting the best agencies in the U.S. MMA is now a $3 billion revenue business. In the same month, Marsh announced an agreement to acquire Honan Insurance Group. This deal expands our Australian middle market business and our position across the Pacific region and Asia. Honan specializes in corporate risk and employee benefits and serves over 30,000 clients. Beyond acquisitions, we continue to make targeted investments in talent, sales operations, and go-to-market strategies. We are also investing in new technologies and solutions to bring the best of Marsh McLennan to our clients. For example, Guy Carpenter recently launched the next generation of our catastrophe analytics platform, GC Advantage Point. The new platform is a critical tool to help clients drive profitable risk selection and manage catastrophe exposure in a quickly evolving risk landscape. Earlier this year, Marsh announced the launch of Cyber Pathway, an integrated cybersecurity and insurance solution for U.S. small and midsized businesses that helps enhance the resilience in a volatile threat environment. The program provides access to key security tools and capabilities as well as insurance coverage that can grow as our clients evolve. And we are investing in technologies that enhance our internal productivity, insights for clients and improve colleague experience. One example is LenAI, Marsh McLennan's internal AI assistant. LenAI offers the power of ChatGPT in a safe and data-secure environment and is available to all colleagues. Developed by our innovation center, it's also helping Oliver Wyman support clients in developing their own AI capabilities. Our approach to balancing investment and growth drives consistent exceptional performance for shareholders and positions us well to deliver new solutions and insights for our clients. Turning to our strategic initiatives. The combined value proposition of our businesses continues to gain traction with clients, especially in certain industries and lines of business. For example, we are focused on enterprise risks for healthcare clients. Our Marsh and Mercer teams are coming together to respond to emerging challenges, such as health and safety, labor actions, and workforce and liability risks from AI. In the private equity and M&A space, Mercer, Marsh, and Oliver Wyman are combining capabilities to help client’s close deals and create post-transaction value. This can include due diligence, advisory on large transformations, health and benefits carve-out transactions, and providing stop-loss solutions. And in the insurance sector, Guy Carpenter is partnering with Mercer to provide portfolio management solutions to insurance clients. One example is our advanced balance sheet solution, which is a collaborative approach that aligns risk and return across an insurer's balance sheet. This offering has already resulted in several regional insurers choosing to partner with Mercer for OCIO. We are also finding new ways to operate, reduce complexity, and organize for impact. As we continue to execute on our restructuring actions, we've identified additional opportunities to rationalize technology, reduce our real estate footprint, and realign our workforce. We now expect to achieve total savings of roughly $400 million by 2024, with total cost to achieve these savings of $425 million to $475 million. Overall, the momentum we are seeing as our businesses increasingly serve clients together, combined with our restructuring efforts, offers opportunities to deliver enhanced value for clients, drive higher growth, and be more efficient and connected. Now let me turn to the macro environment. The outlook remains uncertain. Capital market volatility has returned with the continued rise in interest rates. The trajectory of inflation and further central bank tightening remain an open question and the geopolitical situation remains volatile. Despite the environment, we continue to perform well, and we have a track record of resilience. We believe we are well positioned to perform across economic cycles and manage our business to grow revenues faster than expenses in good as well as challenging periods. Now let me turn to insurance and reinsurance market conditions. Primary insurance rates continue to increase with the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index up 3% overall, in line with the second quarter. Property rates increased 7% compared to 10% in the second quarter. Casualty pricing was up in the low single-digit range. Workers' compensation increased slightly, while financial and professional liability insurance rates were down mid-single digits. Cyber insurance pricing decreased modestly after several years of increases. In reinsurance, our clients have faced consistent challenges throughout 2023. This includes elevated cat losses, core and social inflation, and continued political instability. As we look to January 1, the market appears to be more orderly than last year, but we expect underwriting discipline to continue. On the property side, we expect firm pricing, but a more stable market with adequate capacity and increased reinsurer appetite. In casualty, the market is more cautious with reinsurers assessing prior year loss development and inflation. We expect capacity to remain stable. Overall, clients will need thorough preparation and a proactive strategy to achieve desired outcomes. We are well-positioned to help our clients navigate these dynamic market conditions. Now let me turn to our third quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.57, which is up 33% from a year ago. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 10%. Underlying revenue grew 11% in RIS and 9% in Consulting. Marsh was up 8%, Guy Carpenter 8%, Mercer 8%, and Oliver Wyman grew 12%. Overall, the third quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 24% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points year-over-year. For the nine months, consolidated revenue grew 10% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 17% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $6.31, up 17% from a year ago. With our outstanding results in the third quarter and year-to-date, we remain on track for a terrific year. Based on our outlook today and assuming current market conditions persist, we now expect full-year underlying revenue growth to be 9% to 10%. We also continue to expect margin expansion for the full year and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Finally, I want to provide an update on our recently announced leadership changes. Martine Ferland, CEO of Mercer, will retire on March 31 of next year. Pat Tomlinson has been appointed President of Mercer, where he will work closely with Martine through a transition period and have responsibility for Mercer's global health, wealth, and career practices. Pat will succeed Martine as President and CEO of Mercer upon her retirement. I'm excited to work with Pat in his new role. He brings an outstanding track record as a leader and strong knowledge of our business. He currently serves as Marsh McLennan, U.S. and Canada CEO; and Mercer President of U.S. and Canada; has had 26 years of industry experience, including the last nine years in leadership roles at Mercer. I also want to thank Martine for her leadership. In her five years as CEO of Mercer, she delivered strong growth, built and cultivated our talent, and delivered impact for our clients. This announcement is another example of our depth of exceptional talent and focus on succession planning. Overall, I am proud of our third quarter performance, which demonstrates continued execution of our strategy and continued momentum across our business. I'm grateful to our colleagues for their focus and determination and the value they deliver to our clients, shareholders, and communities. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark McGivney : Thank you, John, and good morning. Our third quarter results were outstanding, continued momentum in underlying growth, strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth and significant margin expansion. Our consolidated revenue increased 13% to $5.4 billion, with underlying growth of 10%. Operating income was $996 million and adjusted operating income was $1.1 billion, up 24% from a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 21.3%. GAAP EPS was $1.47 and adjusted EPS was $1.57, up 33% over last year. Note that adjusted EPS in the third quarter included a $0.10 discrete tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets. Even without this benefit, our adjusted EPS grew 25% in the quarter. For the first nine months of 2023, underlying revenue growth was 10%. Adjusted operating income grew 17% to $4.4 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points and adjusted EPS increased 17% to $6.31. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue was $3.2 billion, up 12% from a year ago or 11% on an underlying basis. This result marks the tenth consecutive quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth in RIS and continues the best stretch of growth in nearly two decades. Operating income increased 21% to $640 million. Adjusted operating income increased 19% to $671 million and our adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 23.4%. For the first nine months of the year, revenue in RIS was $10.8 billion. With underlying growth of 12%, adjusted operating income increased 18% to $3.3 billion. Margin increased 150 basis points to 32.6%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.7 billion, up 9% from a year ago or 8% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 8% growth in the third quarter of last year. Growth in the third quarter reflected solid new business and strong retention. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 6% for the quarter, led by strong growth in MMA. In International, underlying growth was 10% and comes on top of 11% in the third quarter of last year. Latin America was up 14%. Asia Pacific was up 10% and EMEA grew 9%. For the first nine months of the year, Marsh's revenue was $8.5 billion, with underlying growth of 9%. U.S. and Canada grew 7% and International was up 10%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $359 million in the quarter, up 9% or 8% on an underlying basis, driven by strong growth across our global specialties and regions. For the first nine months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated $2 billion of revenue, 10% underlying growth. In the Consulting segment, third quarter revenue was $2.2 billion, up 13% from a year ago or 9% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $424 million. Adjusted operating income increased 24% to $447 million, and the adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 20.8%. For the first nine months of 2023, consulting revenue was $6.4 billion, with underlying growth of 7%. Adjusted operating income increased 11% to $1.3 billion. The adjusted operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 20.1%. Mercer's revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 8% on an underlying basis. This was Mercer's best quarter of underlying growth in 15 years. Wealth grew 7%, driven by continued demand in defined benefits consulting and higher growth in investment management. Our assets under management were $379 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 19% compared to the third quarter of last year and down 4% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven by our transaction with Westpac, a rebound in capital markets, and positive net flows. Health underlying growth was 8% and reflected strength in all segments and regions. Career revenue increased 7%, on top of 15% growth in the third quarter of last year. We continue to see growth in rewards and talent strategy. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $4.1 billion, with 7% underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $781 million, an increase of 12% on an underlying basis that reflected strength in the Middle East and Europe. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $2.3 billion, an increase of 8% on an underlying basis. Foreign exchange was a $0.01 headwind to EPS in the third quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX will have an immaterial effect on fourth quarter earnings. We reported $52 million of total restructuring costs in the quarter, approximately $37 million of which relates to the program we announced in the fourth quarter last year. These charges include costs related to severance, lease exits and streamlining our technology environment. We've continued to pursue efficiencies under this program, and our outlook for savings has increased. As John noted, we now expect total charges of $425 million to $475 million and expect total savings of roughly $400 million, of which approximately $225 million will be realized in 2023. To date, we have incurred approximately $325 million of charges under this program. We currently expect to incur the majority of the remaining charges by the end of 2023 and to realize the bulk of the remaining savings in 2024. Our other net benefit credit was $62 million in the quarter. For the full year 2023, we expect our other net benefit credit will be about $240 million. Investment income was $1 million in the third quarter on a GAAP basis and $2 million on an adjusted basis. Interest expense in the third quarter was $145 million, up from $118 million in the third quarter of 2022, reflecting higher levels of debt and higher interest rates. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $157 million of interest expense in the fourth quarter. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 20.5% compared with 24.6% in the third quarter of last year. Our tax rate in both periods benefited from favorable discrete items. The largest discrete item this quarter was a $48 million release of a valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of around 25.5% for 2023. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with total debt of $13.6 billion. This includes the $1.6 billion of senior notes we issued in September. Our next scheduled debt maturities are in March 2024, when $1 billion of senior notes mature and in May, when another $600 million of senior notes come due. We also recently took the opportunity to increase borrowing capacity under our credit facility, increasing the size of the facility to $3.5 billion from $2.8 billion and extending the term of the facility by 2.5 years to 2028. This was a prudent step to increase our access to short-term funding given the significant growth in our business since we last renewed the facility in April 2021. We are also pleased that Moody's upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to A3 in September. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital in 2023 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $2.9 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1 billion, included $353 million for dividends, $368 million for acquisitions, and $300 million for share repurchases. For the first nine months, uses of cash totaled $2.9 billion and included $944 million for dividends, $1.1 billion for acquisitions, and $900 million for share repurchases. Overall, we remain on track for a terrific 2023. Based on our outlook today and assuming current conditions persist, we expect to generate 9% to 10% full-year underlying revenue growth, strong growth in adjusted EPS and to report margin expansion for the 16th consecutive year. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to John.
John Doyle : Thank you, Mark. Operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the U.S., Canada within Marsh. Organic of 6%, but that is a slowdown from where you guys were in the first part of the year. Can you just give a little bit more color on what's causing the slowdown? And then I think in the introductory comments, you guys mentioned that MMA saw strong growth. So, can you give us a sense of the growth within MMA and the growth outside of MMA within that segment?
John Doyle: Sure, Elyse. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Again, overall, I was quite pleased with the growth -- the revenue growth in the quarter. We had good growth at Marsh. Best growth at Mercer in 15 years. And again, strong performance at Guy Carpenter and Oliver Wyman. Marsh U.S., inclusive of MMA, and I would also note our MGA operation had a good quarter as well. Growth was strong. Marsh U.S. was up 6% versus 5% a year ago. Again, we caution you to look at growth at any one -- at any one quarter. We think we're well-positioned, and our team is executing well. Martin, do you have any other color on what impacted growth at Marsh this quarter?
Martin South : Yes. Thank you, John. As you said, very strong growth for Marsh across the board in International and North America. As you said, we don't comment on specifically on MMA, but they've had a good quarter. The growth in the MGA business was strong. There's partly some impact from the capital markets and some moderating growth in financial construction, cyber lines reflecting some pricing pressures. But as you say, we don't look at this on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We look it over a longer period of time, and we feel very positive about the U.S. business and the Canadian business.
John Doyle: Thanks, Martin. Elyse, do you have a follow-up?
Elyse Greenspan : Yes. And then my second question. So, on the revised savings program, is there a way to give us a sense -- you mentioned, John, it came from rationalizing tech, real estate, and realigning the workforce. How much each of those buckets are contributing to the extra savings? And then is it still fair to assume that most of the savings that you're expecting this year should be falling to the bottom line?
John Doyle: So really, backing up a little bit, Elyse. As our business has operated more closely together, we've just identified additional opportunities. They're largely in the same areas, right? It's around realigning our workforce and mostly in functions, I would say, as opposed to market-facing workforce talent, real estate, and technology. We've not broken it out by group, but the costs are severance, lease terminations, and streamlining technology. So again, we're excited about some of the opportunities that we've uncovered and I'm proud of the team. We're executing against them.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.
Jimmy Bhullar: Good morning. So, first question on the reinsurance market. I think you mentioned the word firm in terms of pricing. And are you expecting prices to be up further from these current levels? Or firm just means that they'll be somewhat stable? And then how do you think that will affect your growth? At Guy Carpenter, you've grown double digits this year. I'm not sure how much of that is because of the tailwind from pricing.
John Doyle: Yes. Thanks, Jimmy. I did use the word firm. There's no question. Our team at Guy Carpenter has done a terrific job this year, helping our clients navigate what's a challenging market. As I said, I expect that the market on January 1 will certainly be more orderly than last year. But there are concerns both in the insurance and reinsurance market about rising loss costs. And so, we don't want to project and can't really project with accuracy and there's still a quarter to run. We expect underwriting discipline to remain. But with that, maybe, Dean, you could offer some thoughts on Guy Carpenter and what we think of the market?
Dean Klisura : Thanks, John. And Jimmy, maybe I'll give you a little color between property cat and casualty as John mentioned. As John noted, we expect challenging market conditions to persist for property cat at the upcoming January 1 renewal, as John noted, driven by inflation. As you're reading about, I mean, cat losses continue to be very elevated. Many attritional losses. Many billion dollar plus events this year. Political instability continues. We do expect pricing to remain firm in property cat. It will vary region by region. It won't be what we saw last year, as an example, in the U.S. and Europe, but we do think that firmness will be there. We do expect additional capacity and an increased appetite from reinsurers to write more business, particularly at higher attaching property cat layers. But I think the key is we expect reinsurers to continue to exhibit that discipline on attachment points, pricing and terms, and I don't see anything going backwards. As John noted, we think property cat capacity in the market will remain adequate. And as John noted, we think it will be a more manageable renewal for our clients. without that significant supply, demand imbalance and dislocation that we saw last year. And we do expect increased demand for our clients to buy more reinsurance and particularly key regions like Europe. On the casualty side, for U.S. Casualty, as John noted, the market is trending very cautiously. And all of our meetings with reinsurers this fall, everybody expressed concern with prior year loss development in U.S. casualty and certain lines, again, driven by economic and social inflation. And we do expect some downward pressure from reinsurers on seating commissions for our clients with quota share contracts and certain casualty lines. But in casualty, we do expect capacity to remain adequate.
John Doyle: The cost of risk, Jimmy is rising, and it's up to us to find the best solutions in the market for both our insurance and reinsurance clients. And so, I think we're well positioned to do that. Do you have a follow-up?
Jimmy Bhullar: Just on Oliver Wyman. I think typically, you think of Oliver Wyman as being sensitive to economic uncertainty. And this year, the business has shown a lot of momentum. So maybe -- I know you won the UBS, I don't know UBS Credit Suisse integration contract, but I'm not sure how material that is. But what's really driving Oliver Wyman? And what's your sort of pipeline look like? And how do you think about it performing if the economy does, in fact, slow down?
John Doyle: Yes, thanks, Jimmy. Oliver Wyman has been more sensitive to GDP over time, but it's also been a faster growing part of our business over time as well. And after a relatively slow start to the year, Oliver Wyman had a terrific run, is now having strong growth year-to-date and a very, very strong quarter. So, Nick, maybe you can share with Jimmy some color on how things look at Oliver Wyman.
Nick Studer : Thank you, John, and thank you, Jimmy. Yes, let me enlarge on that a little bit. It's definitely not an easy environment for discretionary spending in our clients. I still see a fairly wide range of possible economic paths. But John called out our wider resilience of Marsh McLennan, and I'm proud that Oliver Wyman has demonstrated that resilience and chlorine our way back from a flat to Q1. And as Martin said as well, we do try to look at the business on a year-over-year basis more than a quarter-over-quarter basis, but it does matter. We're quite a diverse business now, and we've been becoming more diverse. So, if you think about the sectors that are driving our growth in the regions, our India, Middle East and Africa region has been the biggest contributor to our regional growth with Europe also contributing strongly. On the sectoral side, public sector, which is quite present in the Middle East, our communications, media and technology practice followed by banking, followed by transportation and services. So again, quite a wide array of industry sectors there. And maybe just an interesting case study on the industry side would be our private equity, private capital practice. Clearly, it's not been a great deal environment. But that practice has been doing quite well, driven by portfolio company work. And over the last few years, I've said a few times and have been asked questions about our offerings through the cycle, which we've been seeking to broaden our economic research practices grew strongly, our digital team, our restructuring practice, which is nascent, grew very strongly. Our work on performance transformation with clients, which is more of a tough economic environment offering as well as our people in organizational performance work where we do a lot of collaboration with Mercer. So ultimately, I'm optimistic in our long-term growth prospects, but we continue to plan for mid to high single-digit growth over the longer term. And our pipeline is looking in line with that at this moment.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.
Michael Zaremski: Good morning, thanks. I guess just a follow-up to the last question about kind of global growth. So, Marsh's growth clearly records high levels. I feel like historically, there's been more of a correlation between growth and nominal GDP. If you do agree with that, it just feels like there's been a decoupling of that relationship recently and a good way for you, obviously. And just curious if there's anything structurally permanently that's changed? Or is it -- are there kind of temporary phenomenon with tires? Or anything you want to call out if you agree with the premise of my question.
John Doyle: Sure, Mike. What I would say is it is a volatile macro environment, certainly, both the economy and geopolitically, as I mentioned before. But I do believe nominal GDP is a better indicator of demand over time and with inflation, tight labor markets and pricing positive in the P&C market, those macro factors are certainly supportive of growth. But what I would also say is we've been working very hard to shift our mix of business to better growth markets over time. A handful of examples, M&A, of course, the middle market at both Marsh and Mercer. ROCIO business we've been investing in. We have invested organically and inorganically throughout Asia. And then more broadly, we've invested in talent, sales operations, and our client engagement model. So, we believe we're a better growth business and better positioned. And while, again, that macro environment is quite volatile, we're confident in our ability to perform over economic cycles.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. That's helpful. If I could ask a follow-up, and hopefully, it's not out of left field, but there's been a chatter in the media and at a recent wholesale conference about potentially some of the larger brokers getting back into the wholesale business. I'm not sure if you want to comment on that or can. But maybe you can at least offer some perspective on why Marsh doesn't have as big of a wholesale presence relative to just its market share of non-wholesale insurance?
John Doyle: Yes. Sure, Mark -- Mike, excuse me, I'm happy to comment. I mean, first of all, I would say that the E&S market volumes historically have moved with pricing cycles. I think given the volatile risk environment, I suspect that E&S market volumes will be more durable than they've been historically. Underwriters are looking for flexibility. And third-party wholesalers can give us access to certain markets. At the same time, we access some E&S markets directly today. And so -- in terms of third-party wholesale, I think we'd have to be thoughtful about whether or not we would be a good owner. We do have a business in Victor that does a lot of business with independent really small commercial Main Street agents. That's a marketplace we can serve and do serve today with solutions. But our focus, again, broadly speaking, in Marsh's business is about bringing the entirety of the market, all solutions that are out there, whether they're standard market or admitted market solutions or non-admitted solutions. We want to have the flexibility to do that, and that's what we do to make sure that we can protect and bring the best solutions to our clients. Hopefully, that was helpful.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden : Thanks, good morning. John, in the press release, you mentioned continuing to make investments for the future in this quarter. I'm just wondering if there was an acceleration in some of those investments this quarter, particularly in RIS? And if so, if you could walk through the nature of them and how we can think about the future revenue contribution?
John Doyle: No, I don't -- thanks, David. I don't see it as an acceleration in the quarter. Certainly, on a GAAP basis, in the quarter, expense growth was impacted by M&A, restructuring, but also FX. And even on an adjusted basis, obviously, FX played a role there. But as I said earlier, we're trying to balance delivering today and investing for the future. We're not trying to optimize margins in a particular quarter or for that matter, in a year. We've got a track record, a disciplined track record of growing revenue faster than expense, but we're not going to do it in every quarter, in every business, and every quarter. And so, we see right opportunities to make investments that we think are going to create opportunities for us to deliver value for our clients. We're going to make them.
David Motemaden : Got it. And then just on the Marsh Global Pricing Index, I guess I'm wondering just if we're seeing an acceleration in some of the casualty lines, excluding workers' comp and excluding financial lines, if you're seeing an acceleration there, it sounded like on the reinsurance side, there's a bit more discipline that's entering the market given some social inflation concerns. I'm wondering if you're seeing any signs of that in the primary market?
John Doyle: Yes, it's not a market. I would suggest it's really a collection of markets. And what we saw in the third quarter was, on average, pretty similar to what we experienced in the second quarter. I would note, as it relates to our income statement, we have different levels of commission exposure to different products, right? So, it doesn't always add up to the same amount. But it's a mixed market, and maybe I'll ask Martin to share some thoughts. And just to remind everyone, it's our role is to get the best solution for our retail clients in the marketplace. And we have a role as a market maker, too. And so, we've done a few things as a market maker to try to bring more efficient financing solutions to our clients. Martin?
Martin South : Yes, I agree with that, John. That's our job. Just to level set, we're in the 24th consecutive quarter of rate increases. We'll release our survey in a couple of weeks' time. And I don't think we're at an inflection point when it comes to pricing. The pricing cycles we're seeing across the different geographies and product lines are beginning to show a mix of strengths and weaknesses depending on the combination. The third quarter Casualty grew at 3%. It grew in 3% the quarter before and the quarter before -- and the quarter before. So, we're not seeing an acceleration. But I would say we're hearing a lot more talk from carriers about pressures on pricing and social facing and some of the nuclear verdicts that are out there, and we're keeping our clients closely posted on those. Property was at 7%. These rates were roughly in line with the prior quarter. We saw some softness in FINPRO lines. FINPRO lines came down by 6% in the third quarter. They were down 8% in the quarter before. So, I don't think that's a trend yet, but it's certainly less. And as you mentioned in the introduction, John, our cyber index came down by 2%, and it was up by 1% in the quarter, so three percentage point delta between the courses. So, it's a relatively calm market that we'll see on casualty.
John Doyle: Yes. Thanks, Martin. What I would also say, David, and I mentioned this to Jimmy, but clearly, the cost of risk is rising, right? So, whether it's a frequency of cat events, including extreme weather, casualty loss costs, whether it's core inflation, social inflation, some of the underwriting community referring to as legal system abuse, the growth in litigation funding, concerns for our clients for sure and the underwriting community as well. Thanks, David.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Cox : Thanks, for taking my question. So, I think last quarter, there were some comments that I interpreted as expectations for the level of margin expansion to accelerate in RIS in the second half, but it was just a bit lower. So just curious if you could talk about the puts and takes with respect to the margin relative to and whether it's still fair to assume that the second half of the year will have stronger margin expansion than 2Q?
John Doyle: Yes. Sure, Rob. Again, margins and outcome, it's not our primary objective. Our focus is on growing earnings and free cash flow over time. We're not trying to optimize margin expansion in any period, certainly in any business in any period. We do expect solid margin expansion in 2023, which will be our 16th consecutive year of margin expansion. There were FX headwinds in RIS' margins in the third quarter. But again, I'm pleased with the progress that we've made there. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, again, we expect good solid margin expansion in 2023.
Robert Cox : Got it. And maybe just a follow-up. I think some peers have highlighted expectations for medical costs to increase. So, I was hoping if you could discuss the trends you're seeing in the health and benefit space and expectations as we look into 2024.
John Doyle: Sure, Rob. I'll ask Martine to comment in a second, but we've had good growth in our health and benefits business at Mercer in our business internationally, which is Mercer Marsh Benefits and at MMA. It is a pressure point, clearly, for our clients in this economy. And so, clients more and more looking to us for solutions there. Martine, maybe you could share some insights.
Martine Ferland: Yes. Thank you, Robert, for the question. Thank you, John. Indeed, medical inflation is increasing. And as John just said, it's an advantage for our clients. At the same time, it's not a big part of our revenue sources because a lot of our clients are on fee-based or those kinds of things. When -- we're also working a lot with clients to try to control those costs, control those increases. Because, as you may know, in the health benefit space, very, very often, employers would share the cost with the employee base. So, in this time of our inflation, they're pretty concerned about passing on those costs. So, we're looking at design of the plan, access in a different way, leveraging technology, et cetera. So, there's many different ways that our clients -- that we can help our clients address those increase in costs. And it's impacting revenue a little bit, but honestly, it's a small part for us given all of the counterpoints.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW.
Meyer Shields: Good morning. Two quick questions, if I can. First, John, you talked about macroeconomic uncertainty. I'm wondering how that impacts near-term visibility typically for Mercer in terms of revenue?
John Doyle: Yes. Thanks, Meyer. I would say, as I said, obviously, the macro economy remains uncertain, and there is a fair amount of questions about it. What I would say is mature markets have relatively resilient, but inflation of cost persists Central banks are -- their primary mission is to reduce inflation. But we do see a meaningful risk of recession, and we're prepared for that sure. And some markets are in recession now. But I'll ask Nick, Martine, again, I think Oliver Wyman historically has been a bit more sensitive to GDP and Mercer's Career business has as well. But Nick, maybe you could share some thoughts on the economy and what you think that might mean to our business.
Nick Studer : Yes. Thank you, John. Thank you, Meyer. It's -- as I said earlier on, I think it is a wide range of economic paths that I see different of our sectors do react differently -- and some of our industries have been having a pretty tough time since sort of through and since the pandemic. Some have seen little spurts of growth. We've been growing in some sectors, for example, Aerospace and Defense, where we made a significant acquisition last year, which we see as being more robust through the cycle. I do think that a tough economic outlook tends to result in slower growth for Oliver Wyman. But as I said earlier, we've been trying to develop a wider set of through-the-cycle offerings. And sometimes when the questions all change, people need help answering them. So, it's definitely not a correlation anymore. I think it probably -- that correlation has declined over time and it's pretty low now.
John Doyle: Thank you, Nick. Martine, maybe you can share some thoughts on Mercer Career?
Martine Ferland: Yes. absolutely. And over the last few years, we have focused also on diversifying our portfolio of businesses, and we've improved our business mix a little bit away from the more discretionary nature of the business, particularly in Career with more recurring type of work. And I would add to that, that with our -- with the current environment, there's also lots of demand, as Nick just said. You look at volatile capital markets, for example, drives demand for advice in our defined benefit and our different completion businesses well-funded, the fund benefit plan on the back of high interest rates and also creating demand for pension risk transfer. We talked about tight labor markets, the different -- the change in the ways of working, the upcoming of digital health and technology in the workplace. It's all driving demand and countering the more traditional, I would say, of previous year's impact of direct correlation to GDP, as we discussed earlier.
John Doyle: Thanks, Martine. So, we, of course, Meyer, are not immune to economic growth, but we're a resilient business. And again, we have a track record of performing across economic cycles. And at the moment, demand remains strong. Do you have a follow-up?
Meyer Shields: I do. Just a quick one. That was very helpful. With regard to Oliver Wyman, in the past, I guess, you've communicated that Oliver Wyman, when you have strong growth, there could be some pressure on consulting margins just because of the nature of that business. And we didn't see that in this quarter. I'm wondering, is that context of lower margins of Oliver Wyman less true now?
John Doyle: No, it's not less true. But again, keep in mind, Mercer had its best quarter of growth. It's a bigger business than Oliver Wyman and it's best quarter of growth in 15 years. So that's the reason you didn't see anything there.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Scott Heleniak with RBC Capital Markets.
Scott Heleniak: Good morning. Just at Marsh, just wondering if you could comment what's driving double-digit growth there at EMEA and Latin America? I know that's been strong for a few quarters, but can you give more detail on that? Is there any new areas we're seeing growth? And is there much of a benefit from rate increases there?
John Doyle: Yes, sure. Happy to talk about that, Scott. Again, very pleased with our growth at Marsh. It was particularly strong in the International segment in the quarter. And in spite of mixed economic outcomes in Europe, our business is performing exceptionally well there. And we've had good growth over a long period of time in Latin America. Martin, maybe you could share some color on growth in both of those markets.
Martin South : I'd be thrilled to. Yes. As you say, great growth in international, 10%; Latin America, up 14%; APAC, 10%, EMEA, 9%. So really, really pleasing growth. I'd say there are a few areas that are outstanding at the moment, the energy and power business, the transition is fueling growth. Credit Specialties had a terrific quarter in aviation, as well as MMB, which is a big part of our business in Europe delivered strong double-digit growth. And our advisory business, our value proposition is to go to market through a lens to help our clients think through the cost of risk. And so that's been a big growth area for us as we think that, and we think that will continue to broaden our opportunities. That's been great growth. It's been good growth between renewal and new bid business across the business and we've had less lost business. The clients are staying with us longer as they see the value in an organization like ours that has such broad capabilities. So, we feel very good about that across the board. And of course, you've got the fundamentals in Latin America with protection gap and somewhat emerging markets in Eastern Europe as well that have had a very strong growth as well. So, we feel well positioned and very positive about the trajectory there.
John Doyle: Thanks, Martin. Scott, do you have a follow-up?
Scott Heleniak: Yes. Just one other quick follow-up here. Just on M&A, you did those a couple of bigger sized deals in the quarter. Just wondering if you could just comment on your M&A pipeline versus where it was maybe six months to nine months ago? You're feeling a bit better about those opportunities as you go into 2024, and maybe some areas that you're looking at in particular with the focus areas?
John Doyle: Sure. We remain quite active in the market and the pipeline remains solid for sure. And again, I just want to emphasize how pleased we were to welcome Grant to the family in the third quarter, and we expect to close Hanon relatively soon. They're two well-led businesses. Well positioned solid growth fundamentals in both of them, expanding our presence in the middle market, which gets back to the mix point that I was making earlier. So overall, we closed five deals in the quarter. Those were the two bigger ones. We're very excited about it. We're certainly -- it's an active marketplace. While there's fewer transactions, there's a lot that is at play. And so, we're wide out about and clear on what we're looking for. Valuations remain elevated for strong businesses that are in the market. But we know what we're looking for and we know how to manage the risk of M&A. And so, we're going to be selective and disciplined, but we expect to continue to deploy capital inorganically.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley.
Bob Huang : Hi, thank you. So maybe if we can just go back to Oliver Wyman a little bit. Previously, you mentioned that regarding the UBS and Credit Suisse merger deal. That happened in the second quarter. Just curious if that was a meaningful driver of organic growth for Oliver Wyman into the second quarter and third quarter? And also, on top of that, do you expect any residual from that deal to come through in the fourth quarter and going forward for Oliver Wyman?
John Doyle: Yes. Thanks, Bob. We're not going to comment on individual clients and the work that we do for individual clients. So as Nick talked about a couple of different times on this call, we have an increasingly diverse set of offerings that we think is more resilient, and we're very, very pleased with the growth at Oliver Wyman through three quarters. Again, quarter-to-quarter, we could see more volatility and expect to see more volatility at Oliver Wyman's top-line than our other businesses. But we also expect Oliver Wyman to grow faster over a medium term and longer term. And that's certainly been the case. That's been the case in this year, and we expect it to be the case over the longer term. Do you have a follow-up?
Scott Heleniak: Yes, sure. So, one more thing very quickly. Regarding your cyber insurance practice. I know you mentioned that the cyber insurance pricing growth is slowing down a little bit. There had been a few relatively large headline cyber incidents as well as some cyber claims, namely in the casino gaming area as well as the government, and other areas. Do you expect the current slowdown in cyber pricing maybe just sort of in a soft patch? But do you expect that pricing growth to rebound back? Or do you think the cyber insurance pricing will just kind of stay where it is right now?
John Doyle: Bob, what I -- again, the most important point to make here is it's our job to find efficient risk financing solutions for our clients. So, what I would say is, yes, there's been some major breaches that will drive some insured losses in the marketplace. There's also been an increase, again, in the number of ransomware claims that's -- that have happened during the course of this year. But I would also note that the underwriting community has reacted to growing ransomware claims over the course of the last couple of years through higher attachment points. The market is also -- the underwriting market is also reacting to possible systemic events that could aggregate losses in their portfolios. We're, of course, helping them at Guy Carpenter and at the same time, working with Marsh to build better solutions for that. But the market's been restricting coverage for systemic type events. And so that's a factor in that marketplace as well. And so, I don't think the market will move meaningfully based on a couple of losses. But we have some work to do collectively to help in a digital economy. When I say collectively, I mean the royal we, the entire marketplace, in coming up with better solutions to help clients manage the risks -- cyber-related risks in a digital economy. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.
Ryan Tunis : So, some competitors have like very specifically highlighted pressures -- organic growth pressures in the U.S. from D&O capital markets-related transactions. You mentioned it briefly. Just curious, when we look at your U.S., Canada within Marsh, is there any reason to believe that you guys wouldn't be wearing a headwind of similar magnitude?
John Doyle: Thanks, Ryan, for the question. Yes, I think Martin pointed this out. There's -- I can't talk about relative exposure. But clearly, capital market volatility, the rising cost of capital, M&A activity is down. IPO activity is down. SPACs are down. DSPACs down, all those kinds of things that drive risk and create opportunities for us to offer advice and solutions are under some pressure. And somewhat related to that, as Martin also noted earlier, pricing is down as well. And so those are headwinds. But again, we have a well-diversified business in the United States. We help our clients manage a wide range of risks. And broadly speaking, again, the cost of risk continues to rise for the factors that I mentioned earlier on the call. So, thank you, Ryan. I appreciate that, and I want to thank you all for joining us on the call. In closing, I want to thank our over 85,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. Thank you, all, very much, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's program. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-20 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh McLennan’s Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Second quarter 2023 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings included in our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn this over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.
John Q. Doyle: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call is Mark McGivney, our CFO, and the CEOs of our businesses; Martin South of Marsh, Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter, Martine Ferland of Mercer, and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh McLennan second quarter results were excellent. We performed well across our businesses and geographies extended the best run of quarterly underlying revenue growth in over two decades and generated double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. Top line momentum continued with 11% underlying revenue growth on top of 10% growth in the second quarter of last year. Adjusted operating income grew 17% versus a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2022 and adjusted EPS grew 16%. We also raised our quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.71 and completed $300 million of share repurchases during the quarter. I'm pleased with our performance, especially when viewed in the context of the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. While the U.S. and other major economies have been resilient, there remain significant uncertainty given persistent inflation, continued central bank tightening and geopolitical instability. However, we continue to perform well. As we have discussed in the past, there are factors that are supportive of our growth. We also have a track record of resilience and believe we are well positioned to perform across economic cycles. We manage our business to grow revenues faster than expenses in both good and challenging periods. We've made meaningful investments in market facing talent and improving sales operations and client engagement, which are contributing to our growth. And we continue to deliberately shift our business mix to faster growth areas. So, while the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remains volatile, we see opportunity to deliver greater value to clients through our leadership and capabilities in risk, strategy and people. A good example is Marsh McLennan's work to aid Ukraine's economy. Our four businesses together are mobilizing our unique expertise to support their future recovery and reconstruction efforts. In June, I attended the Ukrainian recovery conference hosted by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. We have the honor of hosting a delegation of Ukrainian and British officials at our London offices where we announced proposals to help with Ukraine's recovery. Some estimates suggest over $1 trillion may be required for this effort. Yet investment capital will not be forthcoming until investors can protect themselves from war risk. To this end, we propose to Ukraine and the G7, the creation of a war risk insurance pool that would ensure commercial insurance is available for reconstruction projects. We also announced that we will partner with the Ukrainian government and insurers to create a data platform for the assessment of war risks. This project draws on Marsh McLennan's expertise and leverages data and information provided by the Ukrainians. By enabling effective and targeted risk modeling, it represents a critical first step for the industry to offer commercial insurance and unlock capital. Our colleagues at Oliver Wyman also partnered with the Ukrainian government to develop a post war transformation strategy. This would reposition Ukraine's economy in a way that leverages national strengths to move beyond resilience to opportunity. At Marsh McLennan, we consider it a privilege to support these endeavors. Now I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on the strategic initiatives we discussed last quarter. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we appointed new leaders for Marsh McLennan International and U.S. and Canada as well as region and country leaders. These leaders are driving client impact through enhanced collaboration, while at the same time maintaining the individual value propositions of the businesses. We are bringing our collective capabilities where there is opportunity to provide greater value. This allows us to harness the benefits of our scale, data, insights and expertise to meet our client’s challenges and realize possibilities. This approach is already yielding benefits and improving the client and colleague experience. At the same time, we are also finding new ways to operate, reduce complexity and organize for impact. The actions we are taking aim to realign our workforce and skill sets with evolving needs, rationalized technology, and reduce our real estate footprint. As we said last quarter, we expect roughly $300 million of total savings by 2024 with total cost to achieve these savings of $375 million to $400 million. Our go-to-market collaboration and restructuring actions are an opportunity to drive higher growth, enhance the colleague value proposition and be more efficient and connected. Turning to insurance and reinsurance market conditions, primary insurance rate increases continued with the Marsh Global Insurance market index up 3% overall versus 4% in the first quarter. Property rates increased 10% the same as last quarter. Casualty pricing was up in the low single-digit range. Workers' compensation was down low single-digits and financial and professional liability insurance rates were down high single digits. Cyber insurance pricing stabilized after several years of increases. In reinsurance, challenging market conditions persisted at mid-year renewals. Reinsurers were disciplined and rate increases remained significant, although the market showed more interest in deploying capacity than at January 1, given the firm pricing and improved terms. Global property cat reinsurance risk adjusted rates increased about 30% on average with loss impacted clients seeing higher pricing. The impact of rate increases on ceded premiums was mitigated by higher retentions. On the casualty side, pricing pressure continued across most lines driven by prior year loss development and concerns about social and economic inflation. We continue to help clients manage these dynamic market conditions. Now let me turn to our second quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.20 which is up 16% from a year ago. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 11%. Underlying revenue grew 13% in RIS and 8% in consulting. Marsh was up 10%, Guy Carpenter 11% versus 6% and Oliver Wyman grew 11%. Overall, the second quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 17% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points year-over-year. For the six months, consolidated revenue grew 10% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 15% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $4.74 up 13% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, we are well positioned for a strong year in 2023. In terms of revenue outlook, given our momentum, we expect full-year underlying revenue growth to be high single-digits. This reflects a continuation of current trends, but as we noted, the macro outlook remains uncertain and can turn out to be different than our assumptions. As for the bottom-line outlook, we continue to expect margin expansion for the full-year and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Overall, I'm proud of our second quarter performance, which demonstrates our continued execution on strategic initiatives and momentum across our business despite an uncertain macro environment. I'm grateful to our colleagues for their focus and determination and the value they delivered to our clients, shareholders and communities. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, John, and good morning. Our second quarter results were outstanding with continued momentum in underlying growth, mid-teens adjusted EPS growth and solid margin expansion. Our consolidated revenue increased 9% to $5.9 billion with underlying growth of 11%. Operating income was $1.5 billion and adjusted operating income was also $1.5 billion up 17%. Our adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 27.7% a good result given the headwinds from the talent investments we made in 2022, the timing of our annual raises and the continued rebound in expenses such as T&E that we mentioned last quarter. GAAP EPS was $2.07 and adjusted EPS was $2.20 up 16% over last year. For the first six months of 2023, underlying revenue growth was 10%. Our adjusted operating income grew 15% to $3.3 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points and our adjusted EPS increased 13% to $4.74. Looking at risk and insurance services, second quarter revenue was $3.7 billion up 12% compared with a year ago, or 13% on an underlying basis. This result marks the ninth consecutive quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth in RIS and continues the best stretch of growth in nearly two decades. Operating income increased 20% to $1.2 billon. Adjusted operating income increased 18% to $1.2 billion and our adjusted operating margin expanded 140 basis points to 34.2%. For the first six months of the year, revenue in RIS was $7.6 billion with underlying growth of 12%. Adjusted operating income increased 17% to $2.6 billion and the margin increased 170 basis points to 36.4%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $3 billion up 9% from a year ago or 10% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 9% growth in the second quarter of last year. Growth in the second quarter reflected strong new business and excellent retention. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 9% for the quarter. In international, underlying growth was 10% and comes on top of 9% in the second quarter of 2022. Latin America was up 17%, EMEA was up 11% and Asia Pacific grew 6%. For the first six months of the year, Marsh's revenue was $5.8 billion with underlying growth of 9%. U.S. and Canada grew 8% and international was up 10%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $576 million in the quarter, up 10% or 11% on an underlying basis driven by strong growth across all regions and global specialties. For the first six months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated $1.6 billion of revenue and 10% underlying growth. In the Consulting segment, second quarter revenue was $2.2 billion up 4% from a year ago or 8% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $388 million. Adjusted operating income increased 9% to $403 million. The adjusted operating margin was 19.2% compared to 19.3% in the second quarter of last year. For the first six months of 2023, Consulting revenue was $4.2 billion representing underlying growth of 6% and adjusted operating income increased 5% to $809 million. Mercer's revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 6% on an underlying basis, representing the ninth consecutive quarter of 5% or higher underlying growth in Mercer. Wealth grew 3% driven by continued strength in defined benefits. Investment management also delivered modest growth. Our assets under management were $393 billion at the end of the second quarter up 11% sequentially and 14% compared to the second quarter of last year. Growth was driven by a modest rebound in capital markets, positive net flows and our transaction with Westpac. Health underlying growth was 10% and reflected strength in all segments and regions. Career revenue increased 6% on top of 17% growth in the second quarter of last year. We continue to see demand for rewards, talent strategy and workforce transformation advice and solutions. With first six months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $2.7 billion with 7% underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $798 million, an increase of 11% on an underlying business and reflected continued strength in the Middle East and Europe and a rebound in the Americas. With first six months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $1.5 billion, an increase of 6% on an underlying basis. Foreign exchange was a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.01 headwind in the third quarter and a $0.01 benefit in the fourth quarter. We reported $65 million of total restructuring costs in the quarter, approximately $50 million of which relates to the program we announced in the fourth quarter. These charges include costs related to severance, lease exits and streamlining our technology environment. We continue to expect total charges under this program to be $375 million to $400 million. To date, we’ve incurred approximately $300 million of charges and currently expect to incur most of the remaining costs in 2023. We still expect to achieve total savings of roughly $300 million by 2024, and now expect to realize approximately $200 million in 2023. Our other net benefit credit was $60 million in the quarter. For the full year 2023, we expect our other net benefit credit will be about $240 million. Investment income was $3 million in the second quarter on a GAAP basis and $2 million on an adjusted basis. Interest expense in the second quarter was $146 million up from $140 million in the second quarter of 2022. This reflects an increase in long-term debt and higher interest rates on short term borrowings, which we use for efficient working capital management. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $142 million of interest expense in the third quarter and approximately $567 million for the full year. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was 24.2% compared with 23.7% in the second quarter of last year. Our tax rate in both periods benefited from favorable discrete items. The largest discrete item this quarter was the accounting for share-based compensation. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2023. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total debt of $12.6 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity is October 2023, when $250 million of senior notes mature. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital in 2023 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. Last week, we raised our quarterly dividend by 20% marking our 14th consecutive year of dividend growth. This increase, the largest in 25 years reflects our strong earnings growth over the past couple of years, confidence in our outlook. Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $1.2 billion. Usage of cash in the quarter totaled $1 billion and included $295 million for dividends, $421 million for acquisitions and $300 million for share repurchases. The first six months, uses of cash totaled $1.9 billion and included $591 million for dividends, $701 million for acquisitions and $600 million for share repurchases. Given our strong results in the first half, we now expect high-single-digit underlying revenue growth for the full year. We continue to expect margin expansion for the full year and strong growth in adjusted EPS. This guidance is based on our outlook today, but as John mentioned, there continues to be uncertainty in the environment looking forward. So outcomes could be different than our current assumptions. Overall, our excellent start leaves us well-positioned for another great year in 2023. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to, John.
John Q. Doyle: Thank you, Mark. Operator, we're ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: Certainly, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, you guys updated your organic growth guidance for the full year to high-single-digits. You guys started-off the year pretty strong at 10% organic growth through the first six months. So, trying to get a sense, as you think about the back half, what businesses might you expect to see some kind of moderation in right to get the high-single-digits for the full year? And then embedded within that guide, what are you assuming for fiduciary investment income in the back half of the year?
John Q. Doyle: Good morning, Elyse. Thanks for the question. Yes, we're -- as I said, I’m quite pleased with the growth year-to-date, and the macro environment although volatile remains supportive of good strong growth, inflation, pricing, tight labor markets, our tailwinds. But, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, we've been shifting our mix of business to better growth markets. We've been investing in talent, sales operations, client engagement. We've sold some non-core businesses and recently announced the sale of a non-core business. So, we've been working very hard at the growth profile of the company. And, our outlook remains quite positive. So, we upped our guidance to high-single-digits, it’s again a terrific start of the year. I feel like we're well-positioned. Our team is executing very well in the marketplace, and in spite of the volatile macro environment, I think we'll have a good second half of growth as well. We're not going to give specific guidance on fiduciary income, but you saw what it looked like in the second quarter, obviously meaningful growth and we expect that to likely continue in the second half.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question is on margin. You guys had pointed right that the Q2 would see lower improvement than the other quarters of the year. Does that still stand and when you expect margin improvement to pick up in the Q3 and the Q4, and with the higher expense savings now $200 million this year, does the higher savings in 2023, do those all come in the back half or was that spread throughout the year?
John Q. Doyle: Yes, I'll ask Mark to talk about the restructuring program, but I was very pleased with the margin improvement in the quarter and year-to-date 100 bps in the second quarter, 130 bps year-to-date. And, just a reminder for everyone, margins and outcome for us, it's not the primary objective, but we do expect to grow revenue more than expense over time, and we're constantly trying to balance with delivering today and investing for the future. I think we're getting that balance right. Our growth in both topline and earnings shows that. We did guide to less improvement in the second quarter, Mark talked about in his prepared remarks some of the drivers behind that. But again, I'm quite pleased with where we are. We expect solid margin expansion again for the 16th year. And, Mark, maybe you can talk about the restructuring program.
Mark McGivney: Yes. Hi, Elyse, how are you? Elyse, you see that we did take up the outlook for this year to $200 million but left the overall at $300 million. It just reflects the fact that we're executing well, and we've just gotten added a little bit quicker. And as we said last quarter, wouldn't be a bad assumption just to assume the savings comes in ratably across the year. And, I would say the same thing. It's just that we've gotten at the savings a little bit quicker. So, I would just assume a ratable spreading over course of the year as opposed to all the increase coming in the back half.
John Q. Doyle: And we do have a bit of better second half comps from the expense -- on the expense line. So, thank you, Elyse. Operator, next question?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hey, good morning. First, just a question on revenues in the RIS business, you've grown at a pretty fast rate the last several quarters and I think generally better than some of your larger peers, and part of that might have been just the benefit from the hiring activity that you've done over the past couple of years. Is the tailwind from that fully reflected in your results and has it fully ramped up or is there sort of more to go there?
John Q. Doyle: Yes. Thanks, Jimmy. As I said, we’re quite pleased with our growth, pick up one of your words just a benefit from some hiring. As I noted, we've been working quite hard at shifting the mix of business, bringing in talent, improving our sales operations, including -- investing in client engagement, we made terrific inorganic investments as well. And so, it's much more than some of the lateral hiring that's in the market. Having said that, we were quite pleased with the hiring we did, and we've gotten good returns from those investments. And, as I pointed out in the past not just -- we've not just been pleased with the financial outcome. Culturally, we were very thoughtful about, who we brought into the organization and they're not only helping us grow, but they're making us better as well. So, we're quite pleased with those investments.
Jimmy Bhullar: And then just you mentioned -- sorry, go ahead.
John Q. Doyle: No, I'm sorry, do you have a follow-up?
Jimmy Bhullar: Yes, I was just going to say you mentioned macro and geopolitical a bunch of times and geopolitical obviously is understandable. Macro, from the outside and it seems like most of the factors are tailwinds more than they’re headwinds, the equity market strong, inflation's high, GDP growth is held in. So, maybe you could just elaborate a little bit on what is it that on the macro side that you see as a negative and specifically on inflation, if it stays elevated, is that -- obviously, it's a positive on your growth, but is it a positive on your earnings as well overall or is the benefit offset by just higher expenses in your own business?
John Q. Doyle: Yes, it's a good question. I was trying to thread the needle a bit, right? I mean, again, the economy has been quite resilient, but inflation remains persistent. You're obviously beginning to see it come down here in the United States, but not at the level that the central bank seems to be targeting, with their mission to reduce inflation, that's going to have an impact on not just the market here, but in other markets. And so, I think there is still a meaningful risk of recession. And in fact, where we do have exposure in other parts of the world we have economies, in recession currently. So -- but I think you had it right, I think nominal GDP is a better indicator of demand for us rather than real GDP and -- excuse me and inflation, overall, we do think is beneficial to the company. We're not again immune to some of the challenges that we confront from an inflationary environment in our expenses, but overall, it's a bit of a benefit. And I would say, well, while equity markets, you pointed out equity markets have improved year-over-year, we've had some headwinds in our investment business from a growth perspective. Although, we're pleased with what's an improving growth profile year-to-date in Mercer investments. Thank you, Jimmy. Operator, next question?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.
Michael Zaremski: Hey, great. First question, maybe I'll try to ask the Jimmy's question differently. So, in the RIS segment specifically, organic growth much stronger than consensus expectations, which is great. Any way you can offer any thoughts on whether a material portion of that kind of excess growth was market share taking versus just the entire maybe overall market conditions for the entire industry were stronger than maybe some expected?
John Q. Doyle: It's a mix of impacts, of course. So, it's difficult to say, with real precision, Mike. But again, you've started to see inflation come down here in the United States. You saw -- and in many markets you're seeing GDP growth slow, P&C pricing moderated a bit in the quarter as well, tight labor markets though remain a positive factor. And overall, at least compared to the 2010 to 2020 decade, it's certainly -- we have more tailwinds than headwinds. But again, we've been working quite aggressively to shift our mix and to improve the growth profile of the company and not just be a passive index candidly on GDP or for that matter P&C pricing. So again, we're pleased -- I forgot to mention when, Jimmy asked the question too, I talked about the economy a bit, but the geopolitical environment remains a risk as well, right? So again, just trying to thread the needle between what's been obviously a terrific first half of the year and what we think is a terrific outlook for revenue growth in the second half, but there's macro risk as well.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. That's helpful. My follow ups on -- if you look at cash flow from operations, net of CapEx, if I'm doing the math right, it looks like it's growing at a pretty big clip. Do you expect free cash flow at this point to grow faster than earnings and any comments, if that's the case, your cash flow conversion will take a step up this year?
John Q. Doyle: It could be a bit lumpier than earnings growth as we pointed out in the past and have demonstrated in the past, but maybe I'll ask, Mark to talk about the outlook for free cash flow growth.
Mark McGivney: Yes, thanks Mike. I -- we've, as I consistently say, we really try not to emphasize focusing too much on free cash flow growth in any quarter or even a year, it can be really volatile. Yes, as you point out in the second quarter, free cash flow was up quite nicely. If there is, we have to be careful especially early in the year for us, because it’s a bit of a low base issue, with our cash flows tend to be lower early in the year, as you know then later in the year. But look, we've had a terrific run over a long period time of double digit free cash flow growth that has tracked pretty closely to our run of double-digit earnings growth last decade and as we've talked about, we're confident in our outlook for continued strong earnings growth and what we would expect that our free cash flow growth in the future would track that as well.
John Q. Doyle: Thank you, Mike. Operator, next question?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Cox: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just thinking about the Marsh business, and I realize growth has been strong both domestically and internationally. But, if you look at those domestically and internationally, if you look at those two areas over the next say, the next year and the next five years, which are you most excited about?
John Q. Doyle: Well, we're not going to give revenue guidance past, what we've given today past this year. But as I said, we're performing well. We're well-positioned. I think we have the best talent in the market, and I do believe we are capturing share, but maybe I'll ask, Martin to talk a little bit about the growth, so far this year and what you see for the rest of the year. Martin?
Martin South: Thanks, John. As we said, we had a great strong organic growth of 10% in the second quarter, which is on top of 9%, which we posted in the second quarter of ’22, and better than full year growth of 8%. As you said, great balance international was 10%, Latin America is 17%, EMEA 11%, APAC 6%, U.S. and Canada 9%. I'd say the growth has been, it’s a really nice balance across all the geographies. The specialties growth was strong. Credit specialties, construction, aviation, energy and power strong, our advisory business, part of the risk advisor of the future, very strong double-digit growth. MMB was strong. Renewal growth was strong. So, it's just a nice mix of business across the board, both new business and renewal.
John Q. Doyle: Yes. Thanks, Martin. And again, the consistency of growth has been just outstanding in addition to the total. Do you have a follow-up, Rob?
Robert Cox: Yes, thanks. And so maybe switching to Oliver Wyman, growth came in well above the levels you guys had guided from last quarter. And there have been a number of positive economic data points as of late, do you see the pipeline reflecting that? And is it looking like growth in the back half?
John Q. Doyle: Yes, we're – thanks Rob. We’re very pleased with the growth at Oliver Wyman. I'll ask Nick to talk a bit more about in detail. Nick?
Nick Studer: Yes, thank you, Robert. We still see a relatively wide range of possible future outcomes. When we gave guidance at the end of the first quarter. That was based on what we saw in our sales pipeline, which was ticking up nicely, but not aggressively. In the second quarter, we saw quite strong growth in sales. It's a, I would say, a reflection on places where Oliver Wyman’s being selected to support our clients really transformative moments led by our public sector practice, led by our banking practice, transportation and services and our telco teams. And then also some of our other businesses, our economic research consulting nearer and our brand consulting business, Lippincott showing strong growth and our digital practice is showing strong growth. So, I wouldn't say yet that it's correlated with economic uptick. Clients need to use this for that performance transformation as well as for their growth strategy. But sales in the second quarter have been better than we've expected and in the near term, I'm relatively optimistic. And the longer term, the economic outcomes are still fairly widely ranged.
John Q. Doyle: Thank you, Nick. Operator, do we have a follow-up?
Robert Cox: I'm sorry. Next question actually that was the follow-up.
Operator: Question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just had another question on the increased outlook to high single-digit for the year. Just sort of high-level question. Was that improved outlook more function of the results you've achieved to-date or has your outlook improved at all going forward?
John Q. Doyle: Thanks, David for the question. It’s really a function of both, right? We've had again a terrific start to the year, very, very pleased with the growth. And again, not just growth in parts of the business, just broad based, good execution and a lot of hard work by the team and really a reflection of the value that we're creating for clients. And so, we remain positive with that outlook. And again, geopolitical environment particularly but also the macroeconomic outlook or there's volatility there. So, we want to be mindful of that, but we feel very good about the second half.
David Motemaden: Got it. Thanks. And maybe just a question on Mercer career. So, I saw that decelerated a little bit, the growth decelerated, and the compare wasn't that much harder than the first quarter. So, I'm just wondering is there anything that you're seeing there on the pipeline front or just anything that would indicate that any clouds on the horizon?
John Q. Doyle: Yes, thanks David. We love what we're doing at Mercer careers. Let me ask Martine to talk about our results here to-date.
Martine Ferland: Yes. Thanks, David for the question. And you touched on it. The quarter growth this quarter was on top of challenging 17% comparable for the second quarter of last year. Our quarter at 6% in Q2 now has also been impacted by the delay of start of certain projects. But I would say that the fundamentals for the business remain very strong. We have 9% growth year-to-date. The demand for service continues, our clients still grapple with labor shortages, wage inflation, dealing with new ways of working, tech in the workplace. We discussed generative AI with the clients. So, you're right, it's also a business that has the largest opponent the discretionary compliance for us at Mercer and we are always watching the macroeconomics. But I would say at this point, our sales, our pipeline, client sentiments, very strong. So it continues to give us good visibility into strength for the third quarter and beyond. So, I’m confident that the rest of the year will be good for career.
John Q. Doyle: Thanks, Martine. Thanks, David. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Ward with Citi.
Michael Ward: Thanks. Good morning. You called out global specialty in Guy Carpenter. Just wondering if you can discuss some of those trends and maybe the runway and how significant those impacts are?
John Q. Doyle: Sure. Thanks, Mike for the question. Maybe I'll ask Dean we're quite pleased with our execution of what's been a very, very challenging reinsurance market in the first half of this year. But Dean, maybe you can talk about the growth of GC.
Dean Klisura: Sure. Thanks, John. We're very pleased with our 11% underlying growth in the quarter, 10% for the first half of the year. As you call out, we've seen strong growth across all of our regions in particular internationally and global specialties. Global specialties plays deeply in the retrocession capital market based in London and globally and there's been some capital challenges. Despite that, we've seen some capital inflow into the marketplace. But despite market conditions, our global specialty team continues to grow and perform impressively. New business across Guy Carpenter continues to accelerate. Some of that's from all the talent that we hired we're winning in the marketplace. We're seeing very strong demand in this marketplace for analytics platform. Which we think is the best in the marketplace. Demand for our advice and solutions remains strong. I mean our clients are really experiencing and seeing a flight to quality works in a challenging market environment where capital is still constrained where reinsurers are driving really challenging terms and conditions, you want to be with the best. I think also Guy Carpenter securities is differentiating in the marketplace. We did over 20 cap bond deals in the first half of the year with some of that new ILS capital coming into the marketplace. We've done ILS structuring for key clients. And so, I think there's just kind of real momentum in the business kind of globally. And of course, the market continues to be a tailwind. There's not enough new capital in the marketplace to change the trajectory of the pricing environment.
John Q. Doyle: Thank you, Dean. Martin, maybe you could talk a little bit about the growth in specialties?
Martin South: Yes. Thank you, John. As I mentioned earlier, that where we've seen really good growth in specialty areas being in the credit specialties, maybe not surprising given what's happening in the environment. Construction has been very strong internationally. Aviation and energy and power as those go through transition there and aviation is bounced back. So, feeling very good about that a little so take it with the advisory business as well where we -- the two businesses hang together. We're advising clients increasingly on how to manage that lost cost had to drive growth during the energy transition and so forth. So, all of those specialty areas we're seeing really strong growth and momentum and that's how we go to market. That's how we differentiate ourselves through that lens.
John Q. Doyle: And in a world where the cost of risk is continuing to escalate our efforts to on risk consulting are really important to our clients and driving a lot of value, Mike. I also want to point out, it's obviously been particularly on the reinsurance side of late. But after several years of pricing increases, of course, at Marsh as well. It's a difficult market. We take our role as a market maker quite seriously. And in the quarter, announced a couple of different things that I would point out a multiline facility in London that we call fast track for our clients at Marsh. And then we also created a reciprocal inside of our MGA operations at Victor, as well trying to bring new solutions to what is a difficult market for clients. Do you have a follow-up, Mike?
Michael Ward: Thank you. Yes, that was super helpful. Maybe last quarter you spoke a little bit about developing counter cyclical products in Oliver Wyman. I’m just wondering if you can share some examples on that.
John Q. Doyle: Yes, Nick, you want to talk about some of the capabilities we've been building inside of Oliver Wyman?
Nick Studer: Yes, I mean, there are various of our sectors which are perhaps less exposed to the cycles. So, last year you saw we acquired the excellent Avascent business, which is aerospace and defence specialist as an example. So, some of our sectors we've been trying to position ourselves carefully through the cycle. And then on the capabilities side, we do a very large amount of work now in performance transformation. And that's not solely a downturn-oriented solution but it's needed when clients are going through either margin squeeze on the top line or the bottom line. And then a couple of years ago, we started to build a restructuring practice, it's still very nascent, but we've seen very strong growth in that area as well. So that's just a few different examples. I think the final point I'd make is that really from the pandemic onwards, we've seen a reduction in the correlation between our different industries. Some have been in downturn for quite a long time, some are working through their own sort of mini crises, which sometimes requires advisory support. And then some are quite cyclical, but I'd note that our private equity private capital practice, which obviously slowed considerably over the last three or four quarters has started to pick up and we're seeing activity there both pre and post feel. So that's a sort of bit of a picture across the business.
John Q. Doyle: Thank you, Nick. Thank you, Mike, for the questions. Operator, next question please?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.
Weston Bloomer: This is Weston Bloomer on for Brian. My first question is a follow-up on Oliver Wyman, obviously strong growth there. And you highlighted a few subsectors that saw the growth. I'm curious within financial services and banking, was any of that growth driven by the banking turmoil that we saw earlier in the year or more one-off opportunities? I guess I'm going with that too. Is that something that you think could play out in the back half of this year or 2024 just given the turmoil earlier in the year?
John Q. Doyle: Thanks, Weston. And good question. Nick, maybe you could talk a little bit about -- you mentioned banking being a strength to-date, but maybe you could talk about the outlook.
Nick Studer: Yes, there were different puts and takes in our growth numbers, but perhaps 35% to 40% of our growth was driven by our banking practice. As you know, that is really a preeminent business for us. And at the beginnings of that, crisis. We felt that was just adding to uncertainty may lead to some pauses in decisions which may slow down the pipeline. In the second quarter, we did see some work coming through from it. It's hard to separate out exactly how much is driven by crisis response versus banks preparing to get ahead of capabilities that they now know they need given the very different interest rate environment. There are a lot of the core essentials of the banking system, our muscles that haven't had to be used in the very low-rate environment we've had for a very, very long time. And so, there is work on liability management, interest rate risk management, deposit management, the value of the branch network. Not to mention tuning ourselves up for the new tech and AI capabilities that might be helpful. But yes, we have seen that be a driver of some business already and we continue to expect that over the coming quarters.
John Q. Doyle: Thanks, Nick. -- Yes. Go ahead.
Weston Bloomer: And you highlighted that 35% to 40% of growth was driven within financial services. Have you given a real thumb, I'd always assume that financial services was the largest subsector within OI? Just want to confirm that that's the case or if you've given a breakout there?
Nick Studer: We don't give a breakout. I mean, it's one of our strongest practices. It's also one of the largest sectors in management consulting globally. But it's, yes, one of our strength areas.
Weston Bloomer: Got it. And then just one more within Guy Carpenter. Can you talk about the dynamic versus treaty versus FAC placements? In the kind of the growth outlook that you're seeing there. Are there more opportunities within FAC given just changes in buying or buyer behaviour?
John Q. Doyle: Thanks, Weston. We've seen good growth in fact over the course of the last couple of years, both seated and client driven FAC, Oliver Wyman and excuse me, Guy Carpenter and Marsh work quite closely together to capture that opportunity and to make sure we're bringing all the available capital all over the world to our clients to help again navigate what's been a very, very difficult marketplace. So, the growth has been quite strong in both FAC and in treaty as well. Thank you, Weston. Operator, next question please?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.
Paul Newsome : Good morning. Thanks for squeeze me in. I didn't think I heard much of anything about the M&A environment. I think we're all sort of waiting things to change their versus the --because of the interest rate environment changes, but any updated thoughts on M&A and how you see new environment there for yourself?
John Q. Doyle: Yes, sure, Paul. We remain quite active in the market and have a solid pipeline. We're, of course, we continue to look for businesses with solid growth fundamentals that are well led and terrific talent and not only will they make us better, but hopefully we think we can make them better as well. I'd say the pipeline is pretty broad from both an RAS and consulting perspective. We of course did a big deal in Mercer investments on the 1st of April, so we're excited about that in Australia. We were just in Australia as a team. So excited about the acquisition there and what it means to our investments. The market obviously the number of deals was down. Some buyers, primarily financial buyers are sitting it out at the moment, but strategic players are still quite active. And what I would say, demand is strong. For higher quality businesses that are out there. And so, while obviously the cost of capital has increased quite a bit. Priced assets are still trading at a premium. So, but again, we're excited about what's possible there. We've worked very hard and have built a very strong reputation as a buyer in the market and that creates a lot of opportunity for us. Do you have a follow-up, Paul?
Paul Newsome : Yes. As a follow-up, could you talk about the divestitures that you've made and how important or maybe not important they are to the margin improvements over the last quarter or last year. I mean, I know they're small in size.
John Q. Doyle: Yes. No, thanks. Sorry to jump in on you there. They are relatively modest in size, but we are being thoughtful about the portfolio in that respect. And for the most part, they've happened at Mercer. Again, we recently announced the divestiture of what really is an admin business primarily or really entirely an admin business. And so not core, lower growth, capital intensive, operations and candidly, there are better owners of assets like that than us, others that can bring greater scale and technology and solutions. So, we don't expect to do a lot of it, but where we see the opportunity and it makes us better and stronger and enables us to invest in our core, we'll take steps to do that. Thank you, Paul. Operator. Next question.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jing Li with KBW.
Jing Li : Hi there. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a question on Asia Pacific business. Can you add some color on -- since I see that just a rate of some for this quarter? So, do you expect it to continue for the coming quarters?
John Q. Doyle: Sure, Jing. Maybe I'll ask Martin to talk about it, but we're very excited about the possibility for growth in Asia and in the Pacific, not just that Marsh, but across our businesses as I mentioned as a leadership team, we're recently in Australia and we see lots of possibilities. But Martin, maybe you could talk a little bit about the quarter and your outlook.
Martin South: Okay. I think the important thing when we look at international, we like to look at growth over longer periods of time. With regard to APAC 6% underlying growth in the quarter. It's 8% year-to-date. We think that's much more indicative of what the growth would be like over a longer period of time. Likewise, we probably have slightly elevated growth in Latin America, we'd expect that to normalize over a period of time as well. So, I just think it's something that we're not worried about. We have a great business in Asia Pac and feel very confident about the future.
John Q. Doyle: Lots of opportunities. It's one of the parts of the world where there's a meaningful protection gap. So, Jing, do you have a follow-up?
Jing Li : Yes. So, for this quarter, 6% I guess. So, you mean you guys mean it's kind of like a one-time thing. So, continue to be a double-digit kind of going forward?
John Q. Doyle: Sure. Yes, we're not going to give specific guidance on Asia Pacific underlying revenue growth, but we do think it's an area, a region that we're very well positioned for strong growth going forward as we speak. As Martin mentioned, we're well positioned in that market. We've got terrific distribution throughout most major countries throughout the region and we're excited about it. It's one of the ways in which JLT made us quite stronger. So, thank you, Jing. Operator, are there any more questions?
Operator: I'm showing no questions at the moment. [Operator Instructions].
John Q. Doyle: Operator, we can wrap up if there are no more questions.
Operator: I'm showing we do have a question, a follow-up.
John Q. Doyle: Okay.
Operator: One moment, please. Our follow-up question comes from Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Cox: Hey, just one follow-up on the M&A spec and capital markets activity. Can you give us a sense of whether that continued maybe just directionally if that was more or less of a headwind in this quarter versus the first quarter?
John Q. Doyle: Sure. Maybe I'll ask Martine to unpack our growth at Mercer Investments a bit, Martine?
Martine Ferland: Yes, absolutely. I mean, our OCIO business is grown really rapidly over the last few years. But as you know, it's been impacted by capital markets over the last many quarters. Although it does benefit from net AUM inflows, some of that volatility does drive demand for the OCIO service, What we've seen in Q2 is still a small drag due to year-over-year capital market, but based on the value that we see at the end of the quarter, it bodes well for the rest of the year small accretive growth from capital markets for Q3 as far as we can see from levels today. So, this is a good business for us. It’s about diversified portfolio, the volatility in the equipment market has come down. On the bond market, it's still a little bit elevated. But all of that has contributed to lower need on the client side for advice regarding the volatility, the funding of their pension plans, etcetera. It's been good for us and for our clients have been finding new ways to deal with the environment.
John Q. Doyle: Thank you, Martine, and thanks Rob for the follow-up. I want to thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our over 85,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. So, thank you all very much and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator, thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-20 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan's Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. First quarter 2023 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn this over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan.
John Doyle: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, the President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh McLennan had a strong start to 2023. Our first quarter results were excellent and we are well positioned for another good year. Top line momentum continued as we generated 9% underlying revenue growth on top of 10% growth in the first quarter of last year. We had strong growth across most businesses, segments and geographies with underlying growth at Marsh, Guy Carpenter and Mercer accelerating compared to the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income grew 13% versus a year ago, reflecting our strong growth. Our adjusted operating margin expanded by 150 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2022 and adjusted EPS growth was strong at 10%, building on 16% in the first quarter of 2022. In addition to delivering terrific results, we continued to execute on acquisitions. On April 1, we completed the merger of BT Super with Mercer Super Trust creating one of Australia's most competitive super funds with approximately 850,000 members and 63 billion of assets under management. I'm pleased with our performance, especially when viewed in the context of the volatile macroeconomic environment. The global economy has been contending with high inflation, aggressive tightening of monetary policy by central banks, some recent bank failures and the effects of geopolitical instability. We have a track record of resilience across economic cycles, and there are factors that support continued growth in our business. Although the outlook for real GDP growth continues to be under pressure, inflation remains elevated, driving higher insured values and loss costs. P&C insurance and reinsurance rates continued to increase as carriers priced to account for the rising frequency and severity of catastrophe losses, social inflation and higher reinsurance costs. Healthcare costs are trending higher and employers expect further increases in the years ahead. Labor markets remain tight in most major economies with 3.5% unemployment and nearly 10 million unfilled jobs in the U.S. and short-term interest rates are at the highest level since the financial crisis, lifting fiduciary income. Change and uncertainty create complexity as well as opportunity for clients. Marsh McLennan's leadership and capabilities and risk strategy and people help them navigate shifting landscapes. Turning to insurance and reinsurance market conditions, primary insurance rate increases persisted with the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index up 4% overall in line with the fourth quarter. Property rate increases accelerated to 10% and casualty pricing was up in the low single digit range. Workers' Compensation was flat and financial and professional liability insurance rates were down mid-single digits. Cyber insurance saw the highest increase in our index, although the rate of increase continued to moderate. In reinsurance market conditions remained challenging from January 1 through April 1. Risk appetite for property catastrophe reinsurance remains constrained. Reinsurers continue to push for structural changes and tightened terms and conditions. Limited new capital has entered the market to support property catastrophe risks. At April renewals U.S. property cat reinsurance rates saw increases of 40% to 60% on average for non-loss affected accounts with higher increases for loss affected business. U.S. casualty reinsurance rate increases were more modest. In Japan, property cat rates were up 15% to 25%. The impact of rate increases on ceded premiums was mitigated by higher retentions. We continue to help our clients manage through these challenging market conditions. Now, I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on our recent strategic initiatives and highlight some of the steps we've taken. As we discussed last quarter, our leadership team is focused on delivering the full capabilities of Marsh McLennan to our clients, continuously improving the client and colleague experience, efficiently managing capital and driving growth and value for shareholders. There are meaningful opportunities at the intersections of our businesses where our colleagues can deliver the benefits of our scale, data, insights and solutions that are highly valued by clients. In February, we name Flavio Piccolomini to lead Marsh McLennan for International and Pat Tomlinson to lead U.S. and Canada. Since then, we have also named additional Marsh McLennan region and country leaders. These leaders are driving greater client impact through enhanced collaboration, while at the same time maintaining the strength of the value propositions of each of our businesses. This deliberate focus on collaboration is already yielding benefits. Let me share some examples. Guy Carpenter Securities and Mercer Investments successfully arranged an insurance linked securities transaction for a major insurer to transfer earthquake risk. This type of win, the first of its kind in the insurer's market was possible because of the combined strength of Guy Carpenter's leadership in earthquake parametric structuring and Mercer's deep local investment and regulatory expertise.
Oliver: As we drive deeper collaboration, we're also finding new ways to operate, reduce complexity and organize for impact. As we noted in January, we took actions to align our workforce and skillsets with evolving needs, rationalized technology, and reduced our real estate footprint. We see opportunities for savings beyond the actions we have already taken. Mark will provide further details, but overall, we now expect roughly $300 million of savings by 2024 with total cost to achieve these savings of $375 million to $400 million. Our leadership appointments, go-to-market collaboration and restructuring actions are an opportunity to accelerate impact for clients, reinvest in our capabilities, and to be more efficient and connected. Before I turn to our results, I want to comment on ESG. Our recently released ESG report highlights the many ways in which Marsh McLennan is meeting these challenges and helping clients better manage their strategies. We have a track record of ESG engagement, and it's an area where we continue to see an opportunity to support our colleagues, clients, and communities. Sometimes this work takes place at the macro or community level like Guy Carpenter's work helping communities build resilience in the face of natural disasters through community-based catastrophe insurance. But more often it takes place in our work with clients such as helping clients navigate an evolving climate landscape or our efforts to help organizations address gender and racial pay equity and ensure fairness in rewards. We are proud of the work we do in this area and consider it a privilege to help clients progress their ESG strategies. Now, let me turn to our first quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.53, which is up 10% from a year ago, or 12%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On an underlying basis revenue grew 9%. Underlying revenue grew 11% in RIS and 5% in consulting. Marsh was up 9%, Guy Carpenter grew 10%, Mercer grew 7%, and Oliver Wyman was flat after growing revenue nearly 40% over the last two years. Overall the first quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 13% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 150 basis points year-over-year. Turning to our outlook, we are well positioned for 2023 and continue to expect mid-single digit or better underlying revenue growth, another year of margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Our outlook contemplates that current macro conditions persist, but as we discussed earlier, there's uncertainty regarding the economic backdrop, which could turn out to be different than our assumptions. In summary, the first quarter was a great start to the year for Marsh McLennan. Our business delivered strong performance and we continue to execute well on our strategic initiatives. I'm proud of the focus and determination of our colleagues and the value that they deliver to our clients and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, John, and good morning. Our first quarter results were outstanding and reflected continued momentum in underlying growth, strong margin expansion and double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. Our consolidated revenue increased 7% in the first quarter to $5.9 billion with underlying growth of 9%. Operating income was $1.7 billion, and adjusted operating income increased 13% to $1.8 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points to 31.2%. GAAP EPS was $2.47 and adjusted EPS was $2.53, up 10% over last year. Looking at risk and insurance services, first quarter revenue was $3.9 billion, up 10% compared with a year ago or 11% on an underlying basis. This result marks the eighth consecutive quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth in RIS continues the best stretch of growth in nearly two decades. Adjusted operating income increased 17% to $1.4 billion, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 38.6%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.7 billion, up 8% from the first quarter of last year, or 9% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 11% growth in the first quarter of last year, and reflects acceleration from the fourth quarter. Growth in the first quarter reflected excellent retention and strong new business. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 7% for the quarter, a solid result given the continued headwind from lower M&A and capital markets activity. In International underlying growth was strong at 10% and comes on top of 11% growth in the first quarter of 2022. Asia-Pacific was up 11%. EMEA was up 10% and Latin America grew 10%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $1.1 billion, up 7% or 10% on an underlying basis, driven by strong growth across all regions and global specialties and reflecting the tighter reinsurance market conditions. In the Consulting segment first quarter revenue was $2 billion, up 1% from a year ago or 5% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $411 million, and adjusted operating income was $406 million, up 1%, reflecting continued foreign exchange headwinds and the softer quarter at Oliver Wyman. Our adjusted operating margin in Consulting was 20.3% in the first quarter, a decrease of 30 basis points. Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 7% on an underlying basis. Career revenue increased 12%, the eighth straight quarter of double-digit growth and reflected continued demand in rewards, talent strategy and workforce transformation. Health underlying growth was 12% and reflected strength in employer and government segments and momentum across all regions. Wealth grew 2% on an underlying basis, driven by continued strength in defined benefits consulting, partly offset by a decline in investment management due to continued capital market headwinds. Our assets under management were $354 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 3% sequentially, but down 9% from the first quarter of last year due to market declines and foreign exchange that more than offset positive net flows. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the first quarter was $687 million, which was flat on an underlying basis. As John noted, this follows a nearly 40% increase in Oliver Wyman's revenue over the past two years. Recent sales activity has been encouraging, however, suggesting we could see a return to modest growth in Oliver Wyman in the second quarter. Foreign exchange was a $0.04 headwind in the first quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter and mostly neutral in the second half. I want to provide an update on the restructuring program we discussed last quarter. Based on our plans today, we expect total charges related to this program of between $375 million and $400 million. To date, we have incurred nearly $250 million of charges and currently expect to incur most of the remaining costs in 2023. We expect to achieve total savings of approximately $300 million by 2024 with $160 million to $180 million realized in 2023 and the balance in 2024. Our other net benefit credit was $58 million in the quarter. For the full year of 2023 we continue to expect our other net benefit credit will be about $235 million. Investment income was $2 million in the quarter -- in the first quarter on a GAAP basis, or $4 million on an adjusted basis. This compares to $17 million of investment income in the first quarter of 2022 on an adjusted basis. Interest expense in the first quarter was $136 million, up from $110 million in the first quarter of 2022. This reflects an increase in long-term debt and higher interest rates on commercial paper, which we use for efficient working capital management. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $150 million of interest expense in the second quarter and approximately $575 million for the full year. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was 25% compared with 23.1% in the first quarter of last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discrete items, the largest of which was the accounting for share-based compensation similar to a year ago. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2023. Turning to capital management, our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total debt of $13 billion. This includes the $600 million of senior notes we issued in March. Our next scheduled debt maturity is October, 2023 when $250 million of senior notes mature. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $1 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter, totaled $876 million, and included $296 million for dividends, $280 million for acquisitions, and $300 million for share repurchases. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital in 2023 across dividends, acquisitions, and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. While there continues to be uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy, we feel good about the momentum in our business and there are factors in the macro environment that remain supportive of growth. I would also note that while our current outlook contemplates margin expansion in the second quarter, we expect it will be more modest than in the other quarters, reflecting the talent investments we continued to make last year, the timing of annual raises and a continued rebound in expenses such as T&E relative to last year. Overall, our strong start leaves us well positioned for another good year in 2023. Based on our outlook today, for the full year we continue to expect mid-single digit or better underlying growth, margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to John.
John Doyle: Thank you, Mark. Operator, we're ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: Thanks, good morning. I had a question just on the increased cost saves from the restructuring, so a pretty big increase in that target. I'm wondering, John, if maybe you could just talk about the sources of those benefits and if this is all we, if there's anything more that we could expect potentially in the future?
John Doyle: Sure. Thanks David and good morning. So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks we're excited about the opportunities at the intersections of our businesses. We're being more deliberate and focused on areas of collaboration, and that's creating both revenue and expense or efficiency opportunities for us. I shared or spoke about the news about Flavio and Pat's appointments, so I'm excited about that and the other regional leaders and country leaders that we put in place to really capture these opportunities for us. So, but from an efficiency point of view, they're in the similar areas to what we talked about on the fourth quarter call earlier this year. It's in the area of talent of course and re-skilling and moving talent to important growth opportunities. And I would point out we are reinvesting as well, although the savings we talked about, that's net of reinvestment, beyond people, it's technology and real estate and so it's our best estimate at the moment. But again, we're going to continue to look for opportunities along the way.
David Motemaden: Got it, thanks and, oh sorry, go ahead.
John Doyle: Oh, go ahead. Sorry, David, follow up.
David Motemaden: Yes, I guess I would just follow up on that and just ask, talent is one that you had mentioned. I'm just wondering the Marsh Operational Excellence program and using Centers of Excellence, I'm just wondering how many employees do you have in these centers and where do you think you can get that to over what time period?
John Doyle: Yes, it's you know, we're not in the early stages of the game in terms of mid and back office efficiency opportunity. And I would point out it's broader than Marsh or have similar more kind of way at Mercer and at Guy Carpenter as well. There's still opportunities in front, but we're also still investing in capabilities including in talent and in technology to support these efforts. And so that will drive further efficiencies for us down the road. Thank you, David. Operator, next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hey, good morning. So I had a question on organic growth and the acceleration you reported in the first quarter in the RIS division. Just wondering to what extent results benefited from sort of one off type timing of business type things, or were there other factors that you think are more sustainable in nature?
John Doyle: Yes, sure Jimmy, and good morning. You know, I was very pleased with the start to the year, as you noted, and I pointed out in my prepared remarks, it's an acceleration from our growth in the fourth quarter. You know, I talked about some of the macros that are supportive of growth, not just in RIS, but in our business more broadly. But I also want to point out we've invested in talent in growth areas. We've deployed capital in markets that we think have strong growth fundamentals. And we've also been quite focused all throughout the company in investing in our sales operations capabilities, in tools as well. There's nothing really one-off about what happened in the first quarter. And we feel good about, feel good again about the revenue growth. Maybe I'll ask Martin to share some details and then Dean, to give a little bit of more color of where we saw some of the strong growth in RIS in the quarter.
Martin South: Thank you, John. I'd be delighted to, yes. We're very pleased with the strong organic growth at 9% in Q1, which is on top of the 11% posted in Q1 2022. Our strongest quarter last year, and better than the full year growth of 8%. Solid growth is across International 10%, APAC at 11% EMEA 10%, LAC at 10%, U.S. and Canada at 7%. And as expected, the U.S. and Canada results were once again impacted through tough comps and transactional risk and elevated M&A, SPAC and capital markets activity at the beginning of 2022, when the overall 9% growth in the quarter was on top of 11% in Q1 2022. The specialty growth was good. Credit specialties, construction, aviation, and marine cargo, easily overset the drop in M&A growth. Renewal growth is very strong in U.S and Canada, fueled by the new business we put on in 2022 and stronger client retention and reduced loss business which is very pleasing. So we feel very good how we're positioned. We're very good about our talent, the capabilities in the business and the consistency of the performance across the book and over a number of courses.
John Doyle: All right, great, thanks Martin. Dean, do you want to share some thoughts on the reinsurance market?
Dean Klisura: Thanks, John. Similar to Martin, we're very pleased with Guy Carpenter's 10% underlying growth in the quarter. Again, following 11% growth in the first quarter of 2022, we had very strong growth, consistent growth across all of our regions globally. And despite significant headwinds in the ILS [ph] capital market impacting retrocession placements, our global specialty team had a very, very strong first quarter. Certainly our results reflect tightening market conditions and restrictions in capacity, as John noted, but I think demand for our advice and solutions remains very, very strong in a very challenging environment for our clients. We think the marketplace will be a pricing tailwind moving throughout 2023 and beyond. And keep in mind at Guy Carpenter, we hired significant talent in the marketplace the last three years, and that showed up with record new business levels in 2022 with very strong momentum into the first quarter and beyond.
John Doyle: Great, thanks Dean. Jimmy, do you have a followup?
Jimmy Bhullar: Yes, just a similar question on Oliver Wyman. I think Mark mentioned that you expect modest growth in the second quarter, but should we assume that the results this quarter were impacted by just economic uncertainty and to the extent that continues, then that's the business that will see slower growth through the course of this year?
John Doyle: Sure. Jimmy, I'll ask Nick to jump in, but I want to reiterate again, there's a step change in the size of Oliver Wyman's business over the last couple of years. We saw 40% growth and so there is good demand for capabilities at Oliver Wyman. But Nick, maybe you can talk a little bit more about the first quarter and what you're seeing in the pipeline at the moment.
Nick Studer: Thank you very much for the question, Jimmy. We've known it was coming. I think as I was looking back over the transcripts, it's four or five quarters, I've had the question about economic uncertainty and growth. And you can see from the business headlines, it's a tougher environment for consulting firms right now. We have flat underlying growth. We have added some size through excellent acquisitions. Even at that level, I'm confident that we continue to gain share. It's a fragmented market. It's falling back from the peaks of the last couple of years. And we signaled in Q4 a slowing in our sales as our clients and probably a little bit us as well, paused after a torrid two years and we were taking stock, they were taking stock. In our clients' cases there was that economic uncertainty that you've highlighted. And add on top of that, the regular drumbeats of deal driven revenues in our private equity practice and across our industry practices also remains depressed. I'm extremely confident for the future. We continue to be selective to support clients in significant transformations around the world. We have growth in a range of our businesses. Our India, Middle East and Africa business, where we had a good acquisition last year is growing strongly. Our top sectors are the public sector, automotive and manufacturing and energy, so quite broad based. Our [indiscernible] top brands and innovation business, our economic consultancy mirror are in robust health. Our digital practice continues well. And as I've said before, we've been preparing for more countercyclical offerings in our nascent restructuring practice. Although it's small, it's growing strongly. So we generally guide that through the cycle, we expect mid- to high single-digit growth. But last year was obviously much higher than this. We're now in the slower part of the cycle. But as Mark said, we are currently expecting modest growth in Q2.
John Doyle: Thanks Nick. Before we leave the revenue growth story, I want to ask Martine to jump in here as well. We had a terrific quarter at Mercer, a particularly strong growth in both Career and our Benefits business, but also a rebound in investments. Martine, maybe you could share some thoughts.
Martine Ferland: Yes. No, thank you, John and indeed, we're very pleased with our results, 7% overall and following a 6% Q1 last year, it's across all the regions. And I would say, there's the current macroeconomic environment is really supportive of the services that we bring to market. Our inflation and interest rate, volatile capital market, well-funded defined benefit plans, tight labor markets, demand for digital health services, new ways of working. And we've made quite a lot of investments as well in clear strategy, client segmentation, much more focused their investment in talent, in digital tools and intellectual capital. And therefore, I would say that these market conditions, combined with the clarity of our strategy, our investment, are conducive to this kind of growth. The pipeline that we see, the sales that we are entering Q2 with is strong, and we have good visibility in the next quarter and probably a little bit over. Of course, we're always monitoring the macroeconomic conditions, as we've discussed with Oliver Wyman. But over the years, we've also invested in diversifying our portfolio towards faster growth elements and more recurring businesses in the portfolio. So it looks solid for continuity in the year.
John Doyle: Thank you, Martine. Operator, next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.
Michael Zaremski: Hey, good morning. I hope the questions, I don't have less yield, but I wonder, I'm curious about any comments on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission proposal to get rid of noncompetes. One of your peers commented publicly that they were against that. Any color? Did you guys make a comment and do most? Is it correct that most producers in the U.S. do have noncompetes in their contracts?
John Doyle: Yes, thanks Mike. I don't think there's a lot to report on here. We, of course, are always monitoring any potential regulatory changes or possible impacts on our business. We're certainly very well aware of the FTC proposal, and we've offered feedback through a number of different industry channels. We think Marsh McLennan is an employer of choice in a very competitive industry. We see a healthy environment for sure. And there really aren't noncompetes in businesses for our producers. And if you read the trade press, you'd see a pretty active market for talent. It's a market that we're a net winner in, but nonetheless, there's an active market and talent moving around throughout the industry.
Michael Zaremski: Okay, understood. My followup is on the good, better-than-expected consulting results ex-Oliver Wyman. Just digging in maybe more, it sounds like from your comments, you're not really calling out any kind of one-offs. Just kind of curious if you'd be willing to share whether the results were better than you internally had expected given the kind of macro outlook, especially in like Career, or are things really just we're maybe focusing too much on some of the headlines you read, and things underneath the surface aren't as bad as some of the headlines might suggest.
John Doyle: Look, I think the eco -- yes, yes, no thanks, Mike. Look, the economy has proven to be quite resilient, right? There's no question about that. And I think when you think about Mercer's Career business, there are services that we provide that were probably more discretionary in the past than they are in the current environment. Martine also noted how we've really tried to move into and deployed capital into more growth markets. We have high expectations for our businesses. And so again, we're pleased with the start to the year was good terrific growth. Martine talked about the environment, it remains quite strong, so no major surprises. But again, we're pleased with the start to the year. Operator, next question?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks and good morning. My first question is on the savings program. Can you give us a sense of how much of those 160 to 180 hit your results in the first quarter? And I'm also interested in getting a breakdown between RIS and Consulting? And also, can you give us a sense of the pacing for whatever cedes are left and how that should hit results for the balance of the year?
John Doyle: Sure. Thanks, Elyse, for the question. Mark, do you want to talk a bit more about that?
Mark McGivney: Yes. We haven't been terribly specific, but I'll try to be helpful. So in terms of the -- how much hit in the first quarter, I think we took a lot of action in the fourth quarter of last year, as you saw through the size of the charges. So I think it's probably a reasonable assumption to -- if you wanted to assume a ratable pacing of the 180 to -- or 160 to 180 throughout this year. That's probably not bad. And as John noted earlier, that's net of reinvestments, so that will fall to the bottom line. In terms of split across businesses, we haven't been specific there, but you could look at the proportion of charges in some of our disclosures and make a rough approximation there as well. And so I think ratable spreading of the 160 to 180 through this year is not a bad way to go.
John Doyle: Do you have a followup, Elyse?
Elyse Greenspan: Yes. On the reinsurance side, you guys have highlighted that's an area where you've hired a lot of talent over the last few years. I think I've also seen recently, you might have lost some talent, which we often see in the industry. So just as you think about like the tailwinds of strong pricing in that business, which came up earlier, do you think we can continue to see double-digit organic growth within that business as we kind of see the full impact of the midyear renewals and beyond?
John Doyle: Sure, Elyse. Look, again, it was a terrific start to the year. I'm very proud of our team. It's a very difficult marketplace and helping our insurance company clients navigate in a very, very challenging market. And it obviously has a follow-on effect on our clients at Marsh as well and so we're investing in our capabilities there and are well positioned for growth. It is -- it's an active talent market. As I said earlier, it's a -- from a talent point of view, I really like how we're positioned. Our focus from a talent value proposition is about being your best at Marsh McLennan in all of our businesses and again we've been a net winner there. From time to time, obviously, we'll -- we do have some voluntary turnover, but the turnover you may have read about, it won't impact the trajectory of Guy Carpenter or our business. So we'll see where the market heads. Both Dean and I commented, property cat is the big headline at the moment, that's a line of business that's most acute here in the United States we have a much bigger, broader business than that. But demand for our services there remains quite strong. So we look forward to a good year at Guy Carpenter. Operator, next question?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Cox: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to drill into the retirement business and just any comments on how the economic backdrop may be impacting the business in providing any benefits?
John Doyle: Sure, Robert. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll ask Martine to unpack some of the investment in Mercer Wealth results overall. Martine?
Martine Ferland: Yes. No, my pleasure to do so. Thanks for the question, Robert. It was a good quarter for defined benefit business. And basically, the market condition, the volatility, there's a lot that we can do to help clients navigate through these changes. And I'm pretty proud of the team that has been quite innovative and proactive in addressing these challenges. With the rise of interest rate, even though the asset side of the pension plans are depressed through equity, we've seen a great improvement in the funding of these plans. And when the funding of these plans become better a lot of our clients looked for ways to divest the liabilities and assets to insurers. So we're seeing activities there in the buyout space, and that has fueled the DB Consulting business. So that being said, of course, the DB segment itself on the market is in structural decline. So underneath this, you'll continue to see this. But in the meantime, with the volatility, it does require quite a lot of work, and we're happy to help clients through these times. The other side of that equation in retirement is also the investment side. On the Consulting side, again, we were very busy helping through the volatility, the decline in equity, et cetera. And our OCIO business, which is directly related, we're taking basis points up of the value of assets as a way to pay for the services we render and of course, when the value of assets are depressed, our revenue goes down. But we have net flows into that business. It's a business that has very good long-term growth through net flows through return. It's just been a more difficult period over the last year and a half. We're seeing still quarter-over-quarter like year-over-year headwinds, because the decline in market really started later in Q2 and then through Q3 last year. So that pressure on the year-over-year basis should ease out at current if the current AUM value stay at current level, we should see that starting to turn around in Q3.
John Doyle: Terrific, thank you. Robert, do you have a followup?
Robert Cox: Yes, thanks and just one followup. Are you seeing any benefit from China reopening in RIS? And just wondering if that's something you expect could potentially be a tailwind as we progress through the year?
John Doyle: It's hard to say overall, Robert. I mean, what I would tell you is that our business in China has performed well, even through, if you want to call it, the shutdown of the economy. So we've had good solid growth in our business, both in the Mainland and in Hong Kong. I think, obviously, I think, broadly speaking, the reopening of that economy should ease some of the economic uncertainty all around the world. And to the extent that, that could be helpful from a macro point of view, we certainly are -- we're certainly pleased with those developments. But it's hard to draw a direct correlation. We haven't seen a meaningful uptick, for example, in our -- in growth in China since the reopening. Operator next question please?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Thanks, good morning. I know we've talked about this in the past John, but I was hoping you could walk us through the impact of higher fiduciary income on margins. I'm asking specifically about second quarter, where you were talking about more cautious margin expansion expectations despite the fact that, at least in the first quarter, your fiduciary income was up like 2,000%?
John Doyle: Yes. Look, obviously, fiduciary income is a -- it's a factor in our overall results. We don't look at it separately. We're constantly trying to balance near-term performance, delivering excellent results in the near term with also investing in the capabilities that are going to lead to sustainable growth in the future. We're very thoughtful about how we manage our expense base. That leads to very few surprises for us around our results. And I think we've read that needle well, if you will, nailed that balance over the course of the last couple of years. So we're very pleased with the start to the year from a margin point of view. As we've talked about in the past, margins are -- particularly in a quarter, are not our primary objective. It's an outcome of the way we've run the business. We've had 15 consecutive years of margin expansion. We expect 2023 to be year number 16. But from quarter-to-quarter, some seasonality to investments we make and some other variability that could lead to a different outcome from a -- so it won't be a straight line quarter-to-quarter.
Meyer Shields: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. The second question, if I can. In your prepared remarks, you talked about health care costs going up and I was hoping you could talk us through from, I guess, our perspective, how that impacts, I'm thinking predominantly Mercer because I wouldn't think it would have the same upside that P&C rate increases have.
John Doyle: Well, where we are in commission, obviously it could be helpful and we get paid in different ways and in different EH&B markets around the world. And so again, it's not a straight line. And much like we've talked about in the context of reinsurance, we're very transparent about the compensation we earn and how we get paid with our clients. But effectively, a rising cost of risk is a tailwind, whether it's in P&C or in benefits to us. But we also provide other services and consulting services to our clients to help them navigate some of the challenges. And the tight labor market is a factor here as well. So Martine, maybe you can offer a little more color?
Martine Ferland: You're absolutely right. There's also another element within Health that distinguish it from P&C in a way, is that very often our clients are looking to not increase net cost for their employees because they very often share in the cost. So we see a lot of demand for services from our part on a consulting basis to change the design of these plans to come up with digital solutions instead so that we can control the cost. So the inflation is not always directly manifesting itself in the premiums or in the coverage. There's also, as you said John, a good part of our book that is on fees rather than on commission. So overall, there are many different components pushing the pressure because you're absolutely right, the healthcare costs are increasing all over the world, but the reaction from employers is to try to mitigate these costs through innovative solutions.
John Doyle: One other point on our Health and Benefits business, just to share with everyone, is that it's kind of an important proof point around some of the possibilities around collaboration inside of the company. This is a business that Mercer and Marsh work on together all over the world and it's been a really important growth driver for us over the course of the last couple of years, and it's been a bit of a source of inspiration around what's possible as we come together more and bring our collective capabilities to the client. So thank you, Meyer. Operator, next question?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.
Yaron Kinar: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, both margin-related. So the first one, maybe piggybacking on Meyer's last -- first question. So clearly, you've had three consecutive quarters of 200 basis points or more of adjusted margin improvement in RIS, that's very notable. At the same time, if I'm doing the math correctly, fiduciary income added, what 230 basis points of margins this quarter? Cost saves, I think, by Mark's comments, add another 100 basis points. So there seemed to have been some offsets in RIS. Could you talk about those?
John Doyle: I don't -- certainly don't think of it in terms of offsets. Again, I'm pleased with the margin expansion in the quarter. As I said, we're very disciplined about how we manage our cost base. And we're not trying to optimize margins in any given quarter, right? We're trying to strike that balance between delivering terrific results today and sustainable growth and investment in capabilities that our clients are looking for in the future. So I'm very pleased with our start to the year from a margin perspective.
Yaron Kinar: And I apologize if I'm belaboring the point, but I'm still a little confused, because I thought the $160 million to $180 million of cost saves that were going to be ratable over the year were net of reinvestments. And it sounds like there was some reinvestment in growth this quarter.
John Doyle: We're always investing, of course, in future capabilities that will lead to sustainable growth in the future. There are some direct hiring that we did and investment that we did connected with some growth opportunities in our efforts to be more deliberate around collaboration, but we continue to invest broadly across the business as well. There's also T&E pressure. There's other inflationary impacts on the expense base of the company, but again, I'm pleased with 150 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter.
Yaron Kinar: Got it. Okay. And my second question is on the consulting side. So I think if it weren't for the JLT legacy legal charges, adjusted operating margin would have expanded quite nicely this quarter. I guess, where are we with these charges? And we were at, what, four years from now the acquisition, do you expect those to continue?
John Doyle: Yes. We're pretty far along in that story. That could be usually only some smaller charges that will happen going forward. They are excluded in the adjusted margin that we report, just so you're aware of that. Most of what happened in the first quarter was the resolution of some legacy litigation that existed at JLT. I think there could be some real estate that we're still sorting our way through, but we're largely past these charges. Operator, next question?
Operator:
Kligerman:
Andrew Kligerman: Hey, good morning. I have two quick questions. I think, Martin on Marsh mentioned a bit of a headwind still from the robust IPO and M&A markets in the first quarter of last year. Maybe could you help us size that headwind in the first quarter? And then next quarter, maybe some color on sort of the tailwind of not having it there, I mean I had heard from some competitors that you had a 5% dampening effect on organic revenue growth last year. So just curious if you could help us size that at Marsh?
John Doyle: Yes. We're not going to size that, Andrew. We talked about it a bit in the fourth quarter. It was a bit more of a headwind in the fourth quarter than it was in the first quarter, but it remained a headwind for us. Again, we're pleased with the growth overall. Capital markets are just one input to the overall macro environment and then, of course, what we're doing to execute and to expand our growth. But I mean, you can look at the big data and get a sense of when obviously M&A activity started to tail off and IPO activity. And while it won't be as much of a headwind, it gave us projecting a major rebound in the market over the course of the next quarter or two as well.
Andrew Kligerman: Got it, okay. So no more headwinds at least. And then you had another good year of net hiring. I think it was around 3,000 last year following 6,000 in 2021. Curious what your outlook is for 2023. Are you expecting to see material net hiring? Maybe any color on what you'd like to do and the geographies of the company where you do it?
John Doyle: Sure. Thanks, Andrew. A lot of the hiring we did last year, some of it was connected to the mid- and back-office, some of the work, the investments that we're making to drive some efficiency. Some of it, we brought some contractors on as full-time employees. It was the right economic trade and the rate trade from a service perspective as well. But we're always active in the market in trying to bring talent that will make us better and stronger. And I mentioned earlier, we feel very, very good about our brand in the market. As an employer we work very, very hard at it and voluntary turnovers in all of our businesses at or below historical levels and so we feel terrific. Our colleagues are highly engaged. And it's a complex operating environment, and they're delivering exceptional value to our clients. We'll hire less this year than we did last year or the year before. But again, it's not only the number, the raw number. It's who's on the team and making sure that we're aligning our talent with our clients' needs. Operator, next question?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith: Yes, thanks. A couple of questions here. First, I want to dig into Oliver Wyman just a little bit more here. Mark, I think you said that sales activity looks like it picked up a little bit in the second quarter. So we'll see a little better. I'm assuming that's because you've got such a good financial services practice at Oliver Wyman. You're seeing some spillover from what's going on with the banking crisis. That's one. And also, if I think about ex that, are you seeing any slowdown in kind of corporate spending you're thinking -- or corporation is thinking about kind of a slowdown here and is that maybe why you're a little more cautious about what potentially could happen here going forward?
John Doyle: Thanks, Brian. Look, we have a little less visibility into the pipeline at Oliver Wyman. That's historically been the case with that business. But as Mark pointed, recent sales activity has been better. We appreciate the advertisement on our FI practice. We have a great team of people there. But Nick, maybe you could add a little more color.
Nick Studer: Yes. Thank you, Brian. It's a very good question. I think what we've really seen is uncertainty more than economic decline. A lot of what we do is a matter of choice. But John made a comment with respect to Mercer earlier, that some of those choices become harder not to take right now. There's lots of questions changing, lots of important problems to solve. I think a number of our clients, particularly in the U.S., have been pausing because of the uncertainty. We don't necessarily see that as a big downward step. But they're not quite sure if they're investing for growth or they're investing for cost. And to some extent, the financial services or the banking turmoil extends that period of uncertainty. But we're extremely proud of our market-leading financial services practice in Oliver Wyman. We are, of course, very engaged in that global banking situation, whether that's supporting banks on the management of their funding, deposit and interest rate risks; working with involved factors in the sale and purchase of assets; preparing some of the restructuring that will no doubt be coming. And when we think in the medium to longer-term, that will continue to fuel the growth of that excellent practice.
John Doyle: Brian, do you have a followup?
Brian Meredith: Yes, absolutely. I just wanted to quickly chat a little bit about commercial property insurance pricing, what's going on in that market. You mentioned good strong price increases in the first quarter. Are we seeing kind of an acceleration in that in the second quarter as some of these carriers kind of adjust to higher reinsurance costs? And could that potentially be a little bit of a tailwind for you all as we look into the remainder of the year?
John Doyle: Yes. Thanks, Brian. I don't think our clients at Marsh think it's a good strong increase in pricing. But yes, we did observe higher rate change in property as we expected in the first quarter, given what happened late in the year and what we saw in the reinsurance market at January 1. So what I would say is, broadly speaking, it's a challenging market for our insurance clients at Marsh. Inflation broadly is driving a higher cost of risk, the frequency of weather-related losses, as you point out. And we did see the U.S. retail market -- property market begin to react to some of the reinsurance market changes as well. But Mark, maybe you could talk about pricing in the market broadly and in property?
Mark McGivney: Yes, of course. Well, John, as you said, it's not a good day for our clients. And our focus is on obviously getting the best deals for our clients and making sure that they stay with us and they understand we're driving innovation where we can. It's the 22nd quarter of consecutive rate increases. You highlighted property, and that did, look, as that picked up momentum again into Q1 it accelerated from 7% rate increases we reported in Q4 2022 to 10% this year. And in addition to that, from a premium perspective, there's clear inflation and exposure growth as well, so real pain for the clients. It doesn't necessarily flow through to our business as a good chunk of that high-risk business with high cat business is fee-based and so it provides us stability there. Other lines of business is being driven by social inflation. Casualty would have been higher, but the workers' compensation, which is pretty flat and it's pretty well around the world. The one area where there has been deceleration in price increases has been in the financial product areas, not just the SPAC and de-SPAC, but also some declines in D&O pricing, driven by the fact, there are 20 new carriers that have come into the marketplace over the last year. But actually, the professional intensity lines are robust, and that's really a function of a prior year action deterioration in the professional lines as social inflation drives that. So it's a bit of a mixed picture. But that's the highlight in terms of growth has been properly, and the rest is seeming to stabilize a little bit.
John Doyle: And Brian, maybe just one last point on the retail property market. A lot of the retail wind and quake risk is from February 1st or even March 1st through the 1st of June. And so really beginning to see what's happening from a risk appetite and from a marketplace perspective. So we're in the middle of the story right now. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan, for any closing remarks.
John Doyle: All right, thank you, Andrew, and thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our over 85,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. And thank you all very much. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-01-26 08:30:00) =====
President and Chief Executive Officer: Mark McGivney - Chief Financial Officer Martin South - President and CEO, Marsh Dean Klisura - President and CEO, Guy Carpenter Martine Ferland - President and CEO, Mercer Nick Studer - President and CEO, Oliver Wyman
Operator: Welcome to Marsh McLennan's Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Fourth quarter 2022 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including in our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn this over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.
John Doyle: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, the President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. I am excited to be leading this call today for the first time as President and CEO. Marsh McLennan is an outstanding company with unique capabilities in the critical areas of risk, strategy and people. We help clients address their greatest challenges and find new possibilities as they navigate dynamic environments. We have exceptional talent, a wide range of solutions and a track record of execution in financial performance. Our leadership team is focused on delivering the full capabilities of Marsh McLennan to our clients, continuously improving the client and colleague experience, efficiently managing capital and driving growth and value for shareholders. Over the past year, I've been meeting with colleagues and clients to exchange ideas about how we can accelerate impact for clients and enable their success. These conversations reinforce my conviction that we are in the right businesses with strong brands and deep client relationships. I am confident that we have meaningful opportunity at the intersections of our businesses, where together our scale, data, insights and solutions are highly valued by clients. The strength of our unique value proposition has us well positioned for the years ahead. Today, we are focused, aligned, and succeeding together as our results demonstrate. 2022 was an outstanding year for Marsh McLennan. We generated 9% underlying revenue growth, continuing our best period of growth in more than two decades with each of our businesses delivering strong results. Our total revenue surpassed $20 billion and adjusted operating income grew 11% to $4.8 billion. This was on top of 18% growth in 2021. We reported adjusted margin expansion for the 15th consecutive year. Adjusted EPS growth was 11%. I am particularly pleased with this performance as our results included costs related to our strategic investments in talent and the continued normalization of T&E. These results also came on top of 24% growth in 2021, and we delivered significant capital return to shareholders raising our dividend by 10% and completing $1.9 billion of share repurchases the largest annual amount in our history.
Avascent: We overcame significant foreign exchange and capital market headwinds to generate these results through execution, growth and exceptional client engagement. I'm particularly proud of these achievements amid a year of seamless leadership transitions at Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Our purpose and strategy underpin our performance. Marsh McLennan makes a difference in the moments that matter for our clients, colleagues, and our communities. Turning purpose into practice our strategy focuses on several core elements, promoting a culture that attracts and retains top talent in our business, investing to strengthen our capabilities organically and inorganically, positioning ourselves in segments and geographies with attractive fundamentals, leveraging data and insights to help clients become more resilient and find new opportunities, and delivering Marsh McLennan's full value proposition to enable client success. We complement our colleague and client facing strategy with our approach to expense and capital management. We focus on growing revenue faster than expenses, which contributes to annual margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth, and we manage capital allocation to balance performance in the near-term with investing for the long term. We are accelerating collaboration across our business to drive greater growth and efficiency. We are implementing new ways to operate, reduce complexity and organize for impact. In this regard, we took actions in the fourth quarter to align our workforce and skillsets with evolving needs, rationalized technology, and reduced our real estate footprint. Together, these actions resulted in an approximately $230 million of charges. Based on our outlook today, we expect they will drive $125 million to $150 million of savings in 2023. Overall, they reflect an opportunity to accelerate impact for clients, reinvest in our capabilities, and to be more efficient and connected.
P&C:
ceded: Now, let me turn to our fourth quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.47 which is up 8% versus a year ago or 12%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 7%. Underlying revenue grew 8% in RIS and 6% in consulting. Marsh grew 6%. Guy Carpenter grew 5%. Mercer grew 5%, and Oliver Wyman grew 8%. Overall the fourth quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 13%, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 160 basis points year-over-year. As we look ahead to 2023, we see a mixed economic picture. While there is a risk of recession for major economies, we also believe there are many factors that remain supportive of growth for our business. Softer real GDP growth is offset by elevated inflation, which drives higher insured values and loss costs. P&C insurance rates continue to increase as insurers account for rising frequency and severity of catastrophe losses, the risks of social inflation and higher reinsurance costs. Healthcare costs continue to rise due to higher wages and labor shortages in the healthcare sector. The U.S. labor market continues to remain among the tightest employment environments of the past half century with 3.5% unemployment and over $10 million unfilled jobs and short-term interest rates are at the highest level since the financial crisis increasing our fiduciary income. When the world is volatile and uncertain, demand for our services typically rises. This year's global risks report, which we just published in collaboration with the World Economic Forum highlights that risks confronting our clients extend well beyond economic and insurance cycle concerns. The report identified the cost of living crisis, failure to mitigate and adapt to climate change, extreme weather, natural resource crises, the erosion of social cohesion, cybercrime and geo-economic confrontation among the top risks facing society over the near-term and next decade. In these areas and many others, we are working with clients to meet these challenges, build resilience and capture new opportunities. Our colleagues are inspired by the opportunity to work on these critical issues and to make a difference in the moments that matter. Looking forward, we are well positioned for 2023 and beyond. We expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth in 2023, another year of margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Our outlook assumes current macro conditions persist, but meaningful uncertainty exists and the economic backdrop could be materially different than our assumptions. However, we have a track record of resilience across economic cycles. In summary, 2022 was an outstanding year for Marsh McLennan, one in which all of our businesses delivered strong performance. We generated record revenues and earnings, saw the benefit of recent investments in growth, continued to execute on our acquisition strategy and made record share repurchases. We are proud of the focus and determination of our colleagues and the value they deliver to our clients and shareholders. We closed the year on a high note and look forward to another year of strong performance in 2023. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, John, and good morning. We are pleased with our strong fourth quarter results, which capped another terrific year. We delivered strength on strength from a financial performance perspective and continued to invest organically and inorganically. These investments combined with the actions we took in the fourth quarter, position us well for another good year in 2023. Consolidated revenue decreased 2% in the fourth quarter to $5 billion. As a reminder, the fourth quarter last year included a large gain related to Marsh India. Foreign exchange was also a meaningful headwind to GAAP revenue growth. However, on an underlying basis, revenue increased 7%. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $680 million and adjusted operating income increased 13% to $1 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 160 basis points to 22%. GAAP EPS was $0.93 and adjusted EPS was $1.47. Our full year, 2022 results were outstanding. Operating income for the year was $4.3 billion and adjusted operating income was $4.8 billion, an increase of 11% over 2021. Adjusted EPS grew 11% to $6.85 and our adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points marking our 15th consecutive year of reported margin expansion. 2022 was also a strong year for capital management. We deployed $3.9 billion of capital, enhanced our short-term liquidity, raised our dividend 10% and saw Moody's lift our rating outlook to positive. Looking at risk and insurance services, fourth quarter revenue decreased 3% to $2.9 billion. Note that RIS in specifically Marsh is where the India gain affected our revenue comparisons. On an underlying basis, revenue in RIS increased 8%, the strong result reflecting the momentum in our business and our resilience in the face of macro headwinds and on economic uncertainty. RIS operating income was $472 million in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 23% to $685 million. The adjusted margin expanded 290 basis points to 25.6%. For the year, revenue in RIS was $12.6 billion and increase of 5% with underlying growth of 9%. Adjusted operating income growth for the year was impressive at 15%, our adjusted operating margin in RIS increased 130 basis points to 29.8%. At Marsh revenue in the quarter decreased 6% to $2.7 billion, but was up 6% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of a tough comparison to the fourth quarter of last year, which saw strong M&A and SPAC related activity. For the full year revenue at Marsh was $10.5 billion, an increase of 3% or 8% on an underlying basis. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 5% for the quarter, a solid result given the headwind from lower M&A and capital markets activity. We expect this headwind to persist into the first quarter, but normalize as we enter the second quarter. For the full year underlying growth in U.S. and Canada was excellent at 7%. In international, underlying growth was 8% in the quarter with Asian Pacific up 12%, EMEA up 7%, and Latin America up 4%. For the full year underlying growth in international was strong at 10%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $171 million, up 5% on an underlying basis. For the year revenue was $2 billion, an increase of 8% or 9% on an underlying basis. Based on our current outlook, we expect Guy Carpenter's growth in 2023 to benefit from a tightening reinsurance market. In the Consulting segment, fourth quarter revenue was $2.1 billion flat versus the prior year. Revenue grew 6% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $336 million, and adjusted operating income was $407 million, down 1% reflecting continued foreign exchange and capital markets headwinds. The adjusted operating margin was 20% in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 20 basis points. For the full year Consulting revenue was $8.1 billion, an increase of 8% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income for the year increased 4% to $1.5 billion, while our adjusted operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 19.7%. Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 5% on an underlying basis. This is a good result considering the impact of capital markets on our investments business. Wealth was flat on an underlying basis due to year-over-year declines in both equity and fixed income markets. Solid growth in defined benefits helped mitigate the drop in investments. Our assets under management were $345 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 9% sequentially, but down 17% from the fourth quarter of last year due to market declines in foreign exchange, which more than offset strong positive net flows. Health revenue grew 8% on an underlying basis in the fourth quarter, reflecting strength in employer and government segments and momentum across all regions. Career revenue increased 12% on an underlying basis, reflecting continued demand in rewards, talent strategy, and workforce transformation. For the year revenue at Mercer was $5.3 billion, an increase of 6% on an underlying basis, the highest result since 2008. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the fourth quarter was $765 million, an increase of 8% on an underlying basis, a solid result considering a tough comparison to 22% growth in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year, Oliver Wyman's revenue was $2.8 billion, an increase of 13% on an underlying basis, building on the 21% growth in 2021. As we look to 2023, we expect growth at Oliver Wyman to slow given rising economic uncertainty. Adjusted corporate expense was $68 million in the quarter. Foreign exchange was a $0.05 headwind in the fourth quarter, and for the full year was a $0.12 headwind. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.03 headwind in 2023 with $0.05 in the first quarter and $0.02 in the second quarter, reversing to a modest tailwind in the second half. I want to spend a minute on the $344 million of noteworthy items in the quarter, the majority of which related to actions we initiated last year, as well as the final exit of JLT's headquarters in London. The largest category of noteworthy items in the quarter was $233 million relating to restructuring activities which are focused on workforce actions, rationalizing technology, and reducing our overall real estate footprint. The charges included severance associated with headcount reductions, as well as provisions related to real estate actions. Although we expect some reinvestment of the savings from these actions, the majority will flow to earnings. Based on our outlook today, we expect the benefit to earnings in 2023 could be $125 million to $150 million. We anticipate further actions under this program, which will continue through 2023 and possibly into 2024. We are still refining estimates of future opportunities, but at this point, we don't see additional charges in 2023 or 2024 exceeding the amounts taken in 2022. As we typically do on our fourth quarter calls, will give a brief update on our global retirement plans. Our other net benefit credit was $57 million in the quarter and $235 million for the full year. For 2023, based on our current expectations, we anticipate our other net benefit credit will be about $235 million. Cash contributions to our global defined benefit plans were $169 million in 2022. We expect cash contributions will be roughly $107 million in 2023. Investment income was a loss of $6 million in the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis and a loss of $5 million on an adjusted basis, and mainly reflects losses in our private equity portfolio. Given current market conditions, we anticipate negligible investment income in the first quarter of 2023. This compares to $17 [ph] million of investment income in the first quarter of 2022 on an adjusted basis. Interest expense in the fourth quarter was $127 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense for the full year of 2023 of approximately $565 million. This reflects an increase in long-term debt and higher interest rates on commercial paper, which we use for efficient working capital management. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 22.9%. This compares with 20.6% in the fourth quarter last year. Both periods benefited from favorable discrete items. For the full year 2022 our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.5% compared with 23.6% in 2021. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year was approximately 25%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 25% to 26% for 2023. Turning to capital management in our balance sheet, we ended the year with total debt of $11.5 billion. This includes the $1 billion of senior notes we issued in October. We used a portion of the proceeds from this offering to redeem $350 million of senior notes that were scheduled to mature in March, 2023. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in October, 2023 when $250 million of senior notes mature. Our cash position at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1 billion and included $298 million for dividends, $395 million for acquisitions, and $350 million for share repurchases. For the year uses of cash totaled $3.9 billion and included $1.1 billion for dividends, $806 million for acquisitions, and $1.9 billion for sherry purchases. As a reminder, we have a balanced capital management strategy that supports our consistent focus on delivering solid performance in the near-term while investing for sustained growth over the long-term. We prioritize reinvestment in the business, both for organic investments and acquisitions. We favor attractive acquisitions over share repurchases and believe they are the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long-term. However, we also recognize that returning capital to shareholders generates meaningful returns for investors over time, and each year we target raising our dividend and reducing our share count. Looking ahead to 2023, based on our outlook today, we expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital across dividends, acquisitions, and share purchases. The ultimate level of share purchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. As John noted, there is significant uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy. However, we feel good about our momentum and position, and despite the uncertainty, there are factors that remain supportive of growth in our business. Based on our outlook today for 2023, we expect mid-single digit or better underlying revenue growth, margin expansion, and strong growth in adjusted EPS. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to John.
John Doyle: Thank you, Mark. Andrew, we are ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: Hi, good morning. I had a question first just on the restructuring actions and sort of wanted to just take a step back and just ask, is this a, are you instituting a downturn playbook just based on something you are seeing in the revenue environment that it hasn't shown up in results yet, but is that something that you're seeing and this is a defensive move or should I think of this as more of an offensive move, just from picking up some low hanging fruit that you see just sort of offer improving your efficiency throughout the organization?
John Doyle: Good morning, David. There's nothing defensive about the move, right? We took steps to align our workforce and skill sets with the evolving needs of our clients. You know, as I noted, when I outlined some of the highlights of the global risk report, those client challenges and opportunities are constantly evolving in dynamic and we've also identified some opportunities to create some greater efficiencies across our businesses. We're working more closely together. We've rationalized some technology, reduced our real estate footprint. So it's not an indication of what we think the economic outlook is.
David Motemaden: Got it, thanks. And then maybe just if you could just talk about some of the three drivers that you spoke of, I guess it was real estate, technology and workforce. Any way to size which, how much of that benefit is coming from each of those buckets and how we should think about some of the future actions that you might be taking?
John Doyle: Yes, it's a mix. It's fairly balanced between the three different areas. And you know, as Mark noted, we're still doing some work and we see some further opportunities. However, I think it's likely that further charges would be less than what we took in the fourth quarter here. But again we're challenging ourselves looking at where we've got talent, how it comes together, matching that against evolving needs in the marketplace and then pushing ourselves to operate in a different way and a more efficient way.
David Motemaden: Great. Thank you.
John Doyle: Thanks, David. Operator, next question?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan.
Jamminder Bhullar: Hey, good morning, Jimmy. Hey, so John, you mentioned a little bit in your comments on just the hard market in reinsurance and also the firm market in commercial lines. Can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing, if you're seeing any changes in client behavior, whether more sort of self-insurance or higher retention rates at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter?
John Doyle: Sure, thanks Jimmy for the question. You know, as I noted in my comments, it was a very challenging January 1st property cat renewal. We expected it to be a challenging renewal season prior to Ian, and then Ian of course exacerbated it. You know, I did mention that some of the higher costs are offset a bit by higher retentions. My comments there were primarily about reinsurance and not insurance. But I'll ask Dean and Martin to comment a bit in a second, but what I would say I commented on the higher cat losses over the last several years. Reinsurers of course now have a higher cost to capital, inflation mark to market losses on the asset side of their balance sheet, just FX as well, a number of the big reinsurers and a lot other cat programs in the United States created some FX challenges as well. So, just a number of different factors led to a really reevaluation of pricing and capacity deployment from some of the bigger capital providers. But Dean, maybe you'll, you can go first and give an overview.
Dean Klisura: Yes, sure. Thanks John. I think in terms of client buying patterns, at January 1 in reinsurance, I mean, you mentioned increased retentions, attachment points. I mean, that was reinsured driven, right? Attachment points were up substantially for many of our clients, not only in the United States, but in all geographies with January 1 cat renewals. So our clients were forced to take more risk, more volatility on their balance sheets. In terms of buying patterns, that inflation driven demand for additional limit, everybody talked about all fall didn't really materialize. Clients mostly bought the same amount of cat limit they bought last year. Maybe up incrementally, maybe our global clients bought a little bit more, but in terms of limit, some of that limit that was eliminated at the bottom end of cat programs was put on top of programs, right? So clients made that up. But in terms of buying more, I think for many clients it was cost-prohibitive given the rate increases that John outlined around property cat, very challenging terms and conditions. You know, really reinsurers had the upper hand in this marketplace around pricing, attachment point and very challenging terms and conditions.
John Doyle: Thanks, Dean. Martin, do you want to share some observations about the insurance market?
Martin South:
D&O:
D&O: In terms of behavior, our clients are constantly looking at the optimization of their programs. Our captive management business grew nearly double digits in the quarter and for the year as clients retained some more of their risk and we have a wide range of value propositions to help our clients for the risks which they retain and they manage. And so we feel bullish that the changing market is not going to dampen our growth.
John Doyle: So Jimmy, it remains a dynamic and challenging market for our clients. Higher cat losses, risks of core inflation, social inflation. So we continue to observe underwriting discipline broadly speaking across the market. Do you have a follow up?
Jamminder Bhullar: Yes, just for Mark on fiduciary investment income, it's obviously gone up a lot and even sequentially up to over 50% from 3Q and 4Q. Do you expect -- should we expect a further increase in that over time? Because what we've seen recently is in some of the regions rates are actually flattish over the past several months. So is there more of sort of a lag effect of what's happened with rates in fiduciary investment income or has the portfolio mostly reset higher?
Mark McGivney: Thanks Jimmy. Good morning. We certainly see continued upside in fiduciary income as we look to this year. Rates really didn't start to move till the back half of the year as you know. And even though it seems like a little bit of slowdown in a lot of places, the expectation is rates have not peaked. And also remember even for the fourth quarter, that's an average rate over the course of the quarter and rates moved even in the quarter. So it is something that we expect to continue to give us benefit into this year.
Jamminder Bhullar: Thank you.
John Doyle: Thanks Jimmy. Andrew, can we have the next question please?
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question I guess combines the expense program in some of your fiduciary investment income comments. So the expense program seems like it could be around 70 basis point tailwind to your margins in 2023. And then I would assume you would get incremental uplift from fiduciary investment income rising per Mark's prior comments. So should we think of those two components is, a pretty good tailwind to your margin when we think about 2023 margin improvement?
John Doyle: Yes, we're, I'm not going to give margin guidance, on the call, Elyse, and thanks for your question. Again, I think we're well positioned. We're in terrific businesses, just outstanding talent. And while there's some macro uncertainty, of course, that's out there, we expect strong revenue growth this year and we expect to increase our margins over the course of the year. Mark and I both shared a bit, what we expect to flow to the bottom line from the program this year. But we expect to maintain that discipline, that financial discipline that we've had for many years and to expand margin and to have strong adjusted EPS growth this year.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question on, you guys talked about some pretty robust reinsurance rate increases at January 1. Have you guys seen any changes on your commission structure just given the strong pricing? Are you making any changes to help your clients in the face of that pricing? And then Mark did say that you guys, that Guy Carpenter would see pretty strong growth over the coming year. I mean, we've never heard, we haven't been in an environment, right, with 40% plus price increases. How does that triangulate into organic growth within Guy Carpenter?
John Doyle: We have been in that environment before. We've been around a long time, but it's been close to 20 years since we've operated in that kind of environment. We expect a good year of revenue growth at Guy Carpenter. As I noted in my prepared remarks ceded premiums won't track that rate increase, right? As our insurance company clients retained more risk or have their cap programs attached at a higher level. We work with our clients, of course, to manage our compensation. We're very transparent about that. In some cases, they're cat commission agreements that we have with our, with our clients, but again, we expect it to be a good year for Guy Carpenter.
Elyse Greenspan: And any change in the commission structure?
John Doyle: As I said, we work through that with our clients. We have agreements with them and a very transparent dialogue about how we're remunerated. Thank you.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you.
John Doyle: Andrew, next question please?
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Ward with Citi.
Michael Ward: Thanks, guys. Good morning. I was wondering if you could give a sense maybe of how much more of a tail end could be left from inflation or exposures that you can see as we sit here today?
John Doyle: Thanks Mike for the question. As I noted in my prepared remarks, while we're not immune to the macro economy, of course, there are some real factors that support growth of Marsh & McLennan. In the risk side of our business inflation is one of those areas. So, whether it's wage inflation, core inflation, higher and of course inflation leads to higher losses and more discipline in the pricing environment. All of those issues are supportive of growth. It's a client by client outcome though, right? Some of our clients, there are winners and losers in any economy, of course and some of those distinctions might be more stark in an economy like we're in today. And so some are operating from a position of strength and others of course, will need to be more defensive. So we work through that with them, client by client, but broadly speaking, inflation and nominal GDP, is more indicative of demand for our revenue and our services than real GDP.
Michael Ward: Awesome, thank you.
John Doyle: Do you have a followup, Mike?
Michael Ward: Yes. Actually may be on Oliver Wyman and Mercer career, I know you mentioned a possible slowdown in Wyman, but can you talk about the pipeline and whether you're seeing that slow down or just kind of anticipating businesses reducing their consulting appetite?
John Doyle: Sure, Mike. So let me start by just saying that Oliver Wyman is just a really important part of our value proposition for our clients and a critical part of our company. They advise the C-suite on the critical issues of the day and really help us differentiate our value proposition. We had an outstanding year of growth in 2022 on top of 21% growth in 2021 and over the midterm, medium term, we expect higher growth out of Oliver Wyman than our other businesses. So having said that, we do expect some moderation of growth. So Nick, maybe I'll ask you to share an outlook with Mike.
Nick Studer: Yes, thanks John and thank you, Mike. As John just started to do, let me put Oliver Wyman into context. We're very happy with a second consecutive year of double digit growth. I think it's 15 years since we've achieved that. We've added over a third to this in that time, and we're confident that we gained market share in what is a pretty fragmented market. And that growth was very well balanced. We grew across all our regions, across all of our capability practices and across most of our industries in 2022. But having said that, this is my seventh call, and it's the first one that I've reported on something below double digit growth in the quarter. That 8% does reflect two things. We're certainly lapping a high growth quarter, but at the same time, we did see a slowing in the pipeline as our major clients, and we pause and digest after several pretty turbulent years. We remain optimistic in the longer-term revenue plans. Yes, there was a pretty heavy surge in the last two years, but we'll likely revert and closer to our medium term expectations of mid-to-high single digit underlying growth through the cycle.
John Doyle: Thanks, Nick. Mike, maybe I'll ask Martine as well to comment on Career, Mercer and I would point out Mercer had its best year of growth since 2008, so we feel absolutely terrific about it. Excellent growth in health, excellent growth in career, but Martine maybe you could share a little bit more color?
Martine Ferland: Yes, no, thanks John and Mike as well for the question. Yes, of course and you're right to say that our Career business is the one that has most discretionary projects. So of course we are looking at all indicators in a cautionary way. But what I want to say here is, we've had a tremendous two years in Career. Q4 was a 12% growth. The whole of 2022 was 14% growth. The demand here is really related to change in the world of work. We've added to that in 2022 wage in high inflation. We have the labor shortages issue. So we're looking at reward strategies, workforce analytics, future of work skills, gap, talent engagement, assessment of skills. It's all on top of our client's agenda. So overall at this point, we've entered 2023 with very solid growth momentum, strong sales, strong pipeline. And of course, we are confident in this year, we are monitoring development on sales pipeline and client sentiment given the macroeconomic conditions that are foreseen. But the question remains that as the people agenda stays such an elevated point for our clients that what we're seeing right now is that demand stays strong.
John Doyle: Terrific. Thank you, Martine. Thanks Mike. Andrew, can we have our next question please?
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Cox: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I think previously, maybe not for a while, but you guys had talked about a 3% to 5% organic growth outlook longer-term. Just curious if your view on that has changed at all?
John Doyle: Well, you know, as I shared we expect mid-single-digits underlying revenue growth or better for this year, that's the guidance we're sharing. As I noted Robert in my prepared remarks, we're in terrific businesses, we're well positioned in those businesses, just have outstanding talent and a culture that makes us an employer of choice as well. So we feel good about our growth prospects for the near-term.
Robert Cox: Got it. And maybe just a follow up, yes, how big of a deal are wage pressures in the business today and into 2023, I think the consulting segment perhaps is a little bit more susceptible to that and we saw margins decline year-over-year, so just wondering how big of an impact that is?
John Doyle: Yes, you know, it's been manageable for us for sure. As we said we worked really, really hard on our culture and becoming an employer of choice in the markets that we operate in. I think we attract outstanding talent because of that culture, because of the strength of the brands, and it really enables talented individuals who want to devote their career in the areas of risk strategy and people to be their best when they work here. And that's how we think about it. And as I said earlier it's a privilege to do the work that we do, trying to tackle the issues of the day. We're a collaborative environment, so you do it with some really talented people who are very, very focused on client impact. And our client engagement, our colleague engagement, excuse me, remains very, very high. So we saw some elevated voluntary turnover in the early part of the year, but that moderated in the second half of the year, that I think that elevated turnover was really a bounce back from very abnormally low voluntary turnover. But wage pressure has been manageable for us. We're being thoughtful about merit pools and how we allocate those pools, but we feel very, very well positioned from a talent perspective. Thank you, Robert. Andrew, next question please?
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. Good morning. A couple of quick questions. First, John, strategically, when you can anticipate higher fiduciary income, does that translate into more latitude for longer-term investments?
John Doyle: You know, we're trying to balance, obviously, the near-term and the mid-term. The growth in fiduciary income may or may not be correlated to client demand or opportunities that we see. It's obviously connected to other macro factors. But you know, I think part of the steps that we took in the fourth quarter, the actions that we took in the fourth quarter create capacity for us to make investments and to become a stronger business going forward.
Meyer Shields: Okay, that's helpful. Second question, when we've heard a lot of comments very clearly accurate about the difficult reinsurance renewal season, does that actually impact the expenses that Guy Carpenter incurs? I mean, obviously a stressful period, but I'm wondering about the financial impact.
John Doyle: It was a stressful period. Our colleagues were attested and I would say I don't want to mitigate the impact on our insurance company clients. It was a challenging outcome. Again, we expected a difficult market as well. But no, it doesn't impact our cost base in any meaningful way. And, as I said, the overall outlook is supportive of a good growth environment for Guy Carpenter. Okay, thank you Meyer. Andrew, next question please?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse.
Andrew Kligerman: Hey, good morning. First question is around underlying revenue growth. Marsh is up 6%, Guy Carpenter up 5%. Given the strong exposure growth, the strong rate increases, if you netted that out, would the underlying growth be negative?
John Doyle: No. it would not be, it would not be negative Andrew, but, and thank you for your question. It was a very strong year of growth at both Marsh and at Guy Carpenter. I would note Guy Carpenter is a very, very small quarter. And so again, we're quite pleased with the revenue growth. And as I've said a number of times this morning, Guy Carpenter is very well positioned for good strong growth in 2023. At Marsh, it was an outstanding year. You know, 8% for the year, 6% in the quarter. You know, as we noted, I mean, I'll ask Martin to comment on this in a second. Marsh in the U.S. had some headwinds related to the capital markets, right? So, and Martin mentioned earlier the impact of pricing. We had fewer M&A with less M&A activity, less ITO activity. So as Martin pointed out that an impact on pricing there, but it was more of a volume issue. We expected that entering into the fourth quarter. It's also a headwind for us into the first quarter as well. But we expect a good growth year in 2023. Martin, maybe you could provide a little bit more color to share your thoughts on 2023 and our growth at the end of 2022.
Martin South: Yes, of course, delighted to, thank you. Well, as you said, we had growth of 6% in the quarter. It was on top of the 9% in the prior course of 2021. Strong balance of growth across the portfolio. International in the quarter grew 8%, APAC at 12%, EMEA at 7%, Latin America at 4%. You mentioned U.S. and Canada at 5%. I'd say that the U.S. and Canada was actually impacted by headwinds in our business. So we had tough comps in the prior year from elevated M&A and SPAC activity and capital markets activity in the back half of 2021. We think but for that, we would have been posting underlying growth in the region of 8% for the U.S. and Canada, so very strong results there and we feel bullish that as that normalizes in the first quarter of next year, we're going to see an uptick. The full year growth international was 10%, APAC 13%, Latin America 12%, which is a much better representation of what they're likely to. This is the smallest part of international Latin America, so you should look at the full year as a better indicative rather than just a discreet quarter. EMEA was up 8% and the U.S. and Canada up 7%. And then when we look at what's driven the growth and what we think are likely to grow in the future construction growth was double-digit energy and power dealing with the transition up double percent of trade credit business up double digits. Our advisory business, which helps our clients mitigate changes in risk grew double digits throughout the year. So we feel very good about how we're positioned about the geographies that we're in about our position in the value proposition and feeling good about growth.
John Doyle: So Andrew, we're working our way through some headwinds in the capital markets, but again feel terrific about the growth in 2022 and we believe we're well positioned in 2023 as well. Do you have a follow up?
Andrew Kligerman: Yes, one quick follow up, just curious about the JLT integration cost of $91 million in the quarter, just given that it's been, I think the deal was 2019, so I was just curious what that was?
John Doyle: It was 2019. Mark, maybe you can share with Andrew.
Mark McGivney: And Andrew that pretty much was the final step of integration with the JLT and it related to basically the provisions for shutting down abandoning their headquarters in London as we were able to finally consolidate all of our headcount into our location and into Tower Place. That is an action that was planned at the very early stages of the integration. It just took us that long to refit Tower Place to accommodate all the headcount.
Andrew Kligerman: Got it. Thanks so much.
John Doyle: Thank you. Andrew, we're ready for our next question.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.
Yaron Kinar: Good morning. First question, you had talked about the potential for maybe some compensation structure changes and then [indiscernible] environment. Given that that you've been in this market before, can you maybe give us some ideas or some reflections of how this played out in previous hard markets? How much compensation or commission rate changes in hard markets?
John Doyle: You know Yaron our commission levels have been fairly constant for a number of years. As I said, with some of our larger clients at Guy Carpenter, we've had capped commission agreements that have been in place for many years. And so we work with those clients to be fairly remunerated for the work that we do over the course of the year. And so, we have good, healthy relationships with those clients and work our way through them. So I don't think there's really anything more to share than that.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. And my other question is with regards to the restructuring, so the workforce action that you identified, does that implicate or impact any of the hires that you had back in 2021?
John Doyle: No. we feel terrific about the strategic talent that we brought into the organization over the course of the last couple of years. We invested in talent last year as well. The returns on those investments have been absolutely terrific and driving a meaningful amount of our growth in 2022 and we expect it to drive growth for us in 2023 as well. So as I said, the actions that we took were more about aligning our workforce and skillsets with evolving needs. And it also is connected in some part with how we challenged ourselves to operate more efficiently, more simply and bringing our businesses closer together.
Yaron Kinar: Thanks and nice year ahead.
John Doyle: Thanks Yaron. I appreciate it. Andrew, next question please?
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith: Yes and thanks. Two of them for you. First one Mark, I'm just curious, the $4 billion of kind of planned capital deployment this year, how does that necessarily, how does that relate to kind of what your expectations are on free cash flow? Because I think you actually had $4 billion of capital when you expected to deploy last year?
Mark McGivney: Sure. so Brian, we do plan to deploy about $4 billion of capital. The largest source of that capital deployment will be free cash flow that we expect to generate. We also entered, if you saw our balance sheet, we entered the year with a little bit of cash from the debt raise we did late last year. So, that will provide some additional capital as well.
Brian Meredith: But I guess my point is, you don't expect free cash will be flat year-over-year, do you?
Mark McGivney: Well, free cash flow for us has been a great story as you know, over a long period of time and over time tends to track pretty well with our strong earnings growth. And our outlook is for solid earnings growth. But cash flow can be volatile. So we generally stay away from predicting free cash flow with precision. But as I said, the biggest source of capital underpinning our projected deployment is going to be the free cash flow we generate.
Brian Meredith: Great, that's helpful. And then John, I'm just curious a lot of big corporations out there are tightening belts right now in preparation for what they see as a challenging 2023. And I appreciate you're looking for still a pretty good strong 2023. Maybe you can just remind us what's the lag effect that you see with your revenues vis-à-vis kind of a slowdown in business activity out there? I always remember there's like some lag effect.
John Doyle: Well, it's hard to talk about lag with any precision. And my comments earlier about the broader environment really carry the day. I mean, yes, it's an uncertain environment. It's maybe modestly more positive when you think about the reopening of China and how Europe has at least so far successfully managed energy related risks and the impact on the economy in Europe. Having said that, there's still meaningful geopolitical risks out there. But for us, again, nominal GDP is more indicative than real GDP and demand remains strong for us in our businesses. So, as I said, we expect a bit of a moderation of demand at Oliver Wyman, but broadly speaking, our businesses overall including strong growth prospects for Guy Carpenter remain quite healthy. And if things get more difficult, we know how to perform in a more challenging environment. We have the playbook and we're ready to execute on that playbook. We're a resilient business and so we'll navigate whatever comes in front of us.
Brian Meredith: Great, thanks for the answer.
John Doyle: Thanks Brian. Andrew?
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.
Ryan Tunis: Hey, good morning. First question, just looking at the margins in this quarter, fiduciary investment income was a pretty big contributor, it looked like, to the margin expansion, and the comp ratio actually looked relatively flat with 4Q 2021. I guess that just surprised me a bit, given there was so much hiring a year ago with not much revenue attached to it. So yes, how should we be thinking about, I guess the operating leverage or the lack thereof that on that cooperation in the fourth quarter?
John Doyle: Yes, thanks Ryan for the question. As I said last year start 15th consecutive year of margin expansion, and we expect 2023 to be our 16th consecutive year. I was pleased with the margin improvement, particularly in light of the investments that we've made in talent. So, it's a modest improvement, slight improvement in the comp and then ratio. But again, margin is an outcome for us. We're focused on growing earnings growing the free cash of the business and we're going to invest where we think it makes sense, where we think it can make us stronger as a business and accelerate client impact. But at the same time, what's not going to change here is our focus on continuous improvement and our commitment to excellent financial performance.
Ryan Tunis: Got it. And then I guess just a follow up, John, obviously early days in the new seat, but just curious what you've been focusing on or where you're spending your time?
John Doyle: Sure. My voice has been in our strategy for nearly seven years now. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're in the right businesses. We've got market leading brands. We're well positioned, just outstanding talent. It's a real privilege to get to work with the folks that I get to work with every day. And as I said, our focus on continuous improvement and our commitment to excellent financial performance are not going to change here. Having said that, I see some real opportunities at the intersections of our businesses. Client needs are dynamic as we talked about, and those needs don't fit neatly into the boxes on our org chart. We're a big company. We need to be organized in certain ways, but those needs don't necessarily fit again against not all of them anyway, don't fit neatly into how we're organized. And so we're going to be more deliberate about how we collaborate. We've got a unique collection of capabilities. We're going to go to market together where we think it makes sense and where it makes sense is where we can accelerate client impact and enable our client success. And our colleagues are passionate about client success and the work that they do on behalf of clients. So they're excited about the possibilities. I'm excited about the possibilities. We're also going to work more closely together to drive some efficiencies across our business. So I see a lot of opportunity. Again, I think we're in terrific businesses and a terrific team here and I'm excited about the days ahead. Thank you, Ryan. Andrew that was the last question, we'll wrap it up now.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan for any closing remarks.
John Doyle: Thanks, Andrew. And thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our over 85,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication in a challenging year. And I also want to thank our clients for their continued confidence in Marsh McLennan. Thank you all very much and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-20 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh McLennan's Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Fourth quarter 2022 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is John Doyle, our Group President and COO; Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. Today is my 60th earnings call at Marsh McLennan, and 40th as CEO. After 10 years as President and CEO, I will be retiring from Marsh McLennan at the end of the year. Leading this firm over the past decade has been the honor of a lifetime. Before I jump into our results, I'd like to say how pleased I am about the leadership succession we announced. The appointment of John Doyle as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1st continues to underscore Marsh McLennan's deep trove of industry-leading talent. During John's tenure as President and CEO of Marsh, he drove exceptional revenue and earnings growth. And as Group President and COO, John is finding new ways to harness the capabilities of Marsh McLennan across our business, accelerating impact for clients, colleagues and communities. John has been an indispensable partner to me and the other members of our Executive Committee in shaping and executing our strategy. He knows our business well and is focused on delivering outstanding performance for clients and shareholders. I am confident that our extraordinary success will continue under John's leadership. Marsh McLennan's third quarter results demonstrated strength on strength. Top line momentum continued across our business, extending the best run of quarterly underlying growth in over two decades. We generated strong top and bottom line results despite difficult year-over-year comparison. Underlying growth of 8% in the quarter reflects considerable strength across our organization. It represents the sixth consecutive quarter of 8% or higher top line growth, building on 13% growth a year ago. Adjusted operating income of $851 million was a third quarter record, and grew 12% on top of 19% in the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted EPS growth of 9% is excellent, especially given costs related to our strategic talent investments, the rebound of T&E, and 32% growth in the third quarter of 2021. We completed 500 million of share repurchases in the third quarter, bringing year-to-date repurchases to 1.6 billion, which is higher than any full year level of repurchases in our history. While the economic and geopolitical backdrop is uncertain, we have a proven track record of being resilient through cycles and are well positioned. Overall, our third quarter performance highlights the strength of Marsh McLennan, a critical nature of what we do for our clients and the unmatched expertise of our colleagues. With that let me turn it over to John. 
John Q. Doyle: Thanks Dan and good morning everyone. I am honored to become Marsh McLennan’s next President and CEO, and grateful for the trust and confidence Dan and the Board have placed in me to lead this exceptional company. I'm eager to work with our colleagues in realizing new possibilities to serve our clients, create value for our shareholders, and support our communities.  I'm pleased with our third quarter results. We delivered strong growth despite a macro backdrop that is becoming more uncertain. We are delivering solutions to help clients navigate volatile economic, geopolitical, and risk landscape. As we discussed last quarter, there are aspects of the current environment that remains supportive of our growth. Higher inflation offsets lower real GDP growth, rising interest rates, boost our fiduciary income, and the challenging insurance market drives a flight to quality. We also have a track record of success and being resilient through cycles, and I believe Marsh McLennan is well positioned to perform. I would like to take a moment to discuss Hurricane Ian, that’s had a devastating impact on the people and communities in Florida. Ian has the potential to be the costliest insured event in Florida's history and the second most damaging insured loss of all time. We are working with insurers to help our clients receive much-needed support. Insurance has a critical role to play in building homes and restoring shuttered businesses. Our work reinforces Marsh McLennan's purpose to be there in the moments that matter for our clients and communities.  Ian's Category 4 strength, incredible size, and slow pace resulted in tremendous damage. The cost of which is exacerbated by the effects of coastal development, the escalation of property values, general inflation, and persistent supply chain challenges. While the ultimate insured loss won't be known for some time, the impact on an already stressed property market will be significant. At mid-year reinsurance renewals, property market is already exhibiting strains. Following Ian, the property cat market is likely to tighten even further and perhaps see a significant supply-demand imbalance. We are harnessing our collective expertise, scale and capabilities to bring solutions to help our clients navigate this complex risk environment. Turning to our third quarter financial performance, we generated strong results. Adjusted EPS of $1.18 is up 9% versus a year ago, which is impressive on top of 32% growth in the third quarter of 2021. Total revenue increased 4% versus a year ago and rose 8% on an underlying basis, with 9% in RIS and 8% in Consulting. This is a terrific result, especially considering the prior year third quarter underlying growth of 13%. Marsh had an excellent quarter. Growth was 8%, reflecting new business and strong renewal growth. Guy Carpenter grew 7% [ph] in the quarter, continuing its string of terrific results. Mercer grew 5% in the quarter despite capital market headwinds, and Oliver Wyman grew 13%, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The third quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 12% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points year-over-year. Overall, I am proud of our third quarter performance, which demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business. Given our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance, we are on track for an outstanding year. We expect to generate high single-digit growth, underlying revenue, solid growth adjusted EPS and to report margin expansion for the 15th consecutive year. We are focused, aligned and succeeding together, as our results demonstrate. Before I turn it over to Mark, I'd like to say a few words about Dan. During Dan's tenure at the helm of Marsh McLennan, the company has been transformed. Our revenue has nearly doubled, our adjusted EPS has more than tripled, and our market cap has quadrupled. Our scale and capabilities have been enhanced, and our talent is unmatched. Dan led our expansion into new client segments and launched Marsh McLennan Agency, which has grown to $2.5 billion of annual revenue, closed 100 acquisitions at just over a decade. Dan also successfully led the company's $5.6 billion acquisition, JLT in 2019, the largest in our history. Most importantly, Dan has led our firm with vision, courage and integrity. Faced with the consequences of the pandemic, his values-first leadership ensured that the tough choices were made to safeguard our colleagues, to protect jobs and incomes, deliver for clients, bolster liquidity, and still produce significant growth. His decision were an inspiration to our colleagues and an example to the broader business community. Our financial performance speaks for itself, with Marsh McLennan's total shareholder return more than doubling the S&P 500 during Dan's stewardship as CEO. Less visible but even more significant is the sense of pride and the culture that Dan has instilled in the firm. Under his leadership, we are not only a great stock but a great company. We owe him our gratitude. So on behalf of our 86,000 colleagues, I thank Dan for his leadership. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for further detail on our financial results and a discussion of our outlook for the rest of 2022.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, John and good morning. As Dan and John mentioned, our performance in the third quarter reflects continued momentum across our business. We saw another quarter of strong underlying revenue growth, meaningful earnings growth despite tough revenue and expense comparisons. Consolidated revenue increased 4% to $4.8 billion and reflected underlying growth of 8%. Operating income was 791 million, adjusted operating income was 851 million. Our adjusted operating margin was 19.6%, up 110 [ph] basis points from last year. The increase was driven by modest operating leverage and a benefit from foreign exchange. We generated GAAP EPS of $1.08 in the quarter, adjusted EPS of $1.18 up 9% yearly [ph]. For the first nine months of 2022, underlying revenue growth was 9%, our adjusted operating income rose 11% to $3.7 billion, our adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points to 25.6%, and our adjusted EPS increased 12% to $5.38. Looking at Risk & Insurance Services, third quarter revenue was $2.8 billion, up 6% compared with the year ago or 9% on an underlying basis. Operating income increased 32% to 529 million. Adjusted operating income increased 20% to 562 million, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 200 basis points to 22.4%. For the first nine months of the year, revenue was 9.7 billion, underlying growth 10%. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months increased 13% to $2.8 billion, with a margin of 31.1%, up 80 basis points from the same period in 2021. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.5 billion, 5% from a year ago. Revenue growth of 8% on an underlying basis supported by strong retention and [Technical Difficulty]. U.S. and Canada had 5% underlying growth, a solid result considering a 16% growth in the third quarter of 2021 that included the benefit of significant M&A and SPAC-related activity. International underlying growth was 11%. Latin America grew 15%, Asia Pacific was up 14%, EMEA was up 9%. First nine months of the year, Marsh's revenue was 7.8 billion, underlying growth of 9%. U.S. and Canada was up 8%, International grew 10%. Guy Carpenter's third quarter revenue was 328 million [ph], up 7% on an underlying basis, reflecting solid production and retention. Guy Carpenter has now achieved underlying revenue growth of 7% or higher in six of the last seven quarters. For the first nine months of the year, Guy Partner generated 1.8 billion of revenue and 10% underlying growth [ph]. In the Consulting segment, revenue of 2 billion was up 1% from a year ago or 8% on an underlying basis, building on 12% in the third quarter of 2021. Operating income decreased 14% to 350 million, reflecting a one-time noteworthy benefit a year ago. Adjusted operating income increased 3% to 362 million, where solid earnings growth was masked by a drag from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 19.1%. Consulting generated revenue of 6 billion for the first nine months of 2022, an underlying growth of 9%. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year increased 5% to 1.1 billion, the adjusted operating margin was 19.6%, flat versus the third quarter of 2021. Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the third quarter, up 5% on an underlying basis, which is impressive given the impact of market declines on our investments. Career grew 15% on an underlying basis, a sixth consecutive quarter of mid to high-teens growth. We continue to see strong demand for solutions in workforce transformation as well as compensation and rewards. Health underlying growth was also excellent at 10% in the quarter, reflecting strength across all geographies. Wealth decreased 1% on an underlying basis due to declines in both equity and fixed income markets. This market impact represented a 2% headwind to Mercer's overall growth for the quarter. However, solid demand and defined benefits helped mitigate [indiscernible]. Our assets under management was $318 billion at the end of the third quarter, down 8% sequentially and 20% from the third quarter of last year, due entirely to market declines and foreign exchange. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $4 billion, up 6% from underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's strong momentum continued. Revenue in the third quarter was $667 million, an increase of 13% on an underlying growth. This comes on top of 25% of the third quarter last year and reflects continued strong demand across most geographies against solutions. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was 2 billion, increase of 15% on underlying growth. Adjusted corporate expense was 73 million in the third quarter. Based on our current outlook, we expect approximately 80 million for the fourth quarter. Foreign exchange had an immaterial effect on our adjusted EPS in the third quarter, although year-to-date, you can assess a headwind of 7% [ph]. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a headwind of $0.07 in the fourth quarter. Our other net benefit credit was 57 billion. For the full year 2022, we expect our other net benefit credit be around 230 million [ph]. We reported an investment loss of 1 million in the third quarter on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis, we had investment income of $3 million [ph]. Interest expense in the third quarter was 118 million compared to 107 million in the third quarter of 2021. Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense of 121 million in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 24.6% compared with 24.4% in the third quarter of last year, included a modest net benefit of discrete items [ph]. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, not project discrete items, which is positive or negative. Based on the current environment, reasonable to assume an adjusted effective tax rate of 25% for the full year 2022. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total debt of 11.4 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity March of 2023 with 350 million of senior notes. Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was 802 million. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled 931 million, included 293 million of dividends, 138 million for acquisitions, 500 million for share repurchases. For the first nine months, uses of cash totaled 2.9 billion, included 840 million for dividends, 411 million for acquisitions, 1.6 billion of share repurchase. We continue to expect to deploy approximately 4 billion of cap in 2022 plus dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. Overall, we remain on track for a terrific 2022. For the full year, we expect to generate high single-digit growth in underlying revenue, solid growth in adjusted EPS, and to report margin expansion for 15th consecutive year. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Mark. Before we open up the call for Q&A, I just want to say it has been a great privilege to lead this firm and work side-by-side with smart, creative and dedicated people. I am immensely proud of our colleagues and what we have accomplished. Together, we've grown, innovated and persevered. We launched and built MMA, expanded our capabilities in combination with JLT, and demonstrated resilience in the face of a financial crisis and global pandemic. We emerged as a better and stronger firm by relying on each other, living our values, supporting our communities, and staying focused on clients. I have always believed the greatness of our companies is in how we deliver in the big moments and the small. Under John's leadership, I know Marsh McLennan will continue to thrive and prosper, to make a difference in the moments that matter. There is no one I trust more with the company we've built together, and with the important work ahead. I'd like to thank our clients for choosing to do business with us, our shareholders for their continued confidence, most importantly our colleagues. All that we have achieved is due to their efforts. With that, operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. First, Dan my congrats to you on your upcoming retirement. It's been great working with you through the years. My first question is on U.S. and Canada within RIS in the quarter. The growth did slow from where you guys have been trending. I know we've had some good and bad quarters as we've gone through the pandemic and came out. Was there anything specific going on in the third quarter that you want to point out within that business?
Daniel S. Glaser: Thanks, Elyse and I appreciate your comments. So thank you very much, and I hope to keep in touch with you. So let me just start out. I'll hand off to Martin in a second. Obviously, Marsh has been doing fantastically well, and U.S., Canada has done well as well. So I would just start by saying that the comparable was pretty tough at 16% growth in U.S., Canada last year. But Martin, do you want to dig in and give a little bit more color?
Martin South: Thank you, Dan. Yes. Just to start, we are very pleased with the strong organic growth of 8% in the quarter, which is on top of 13% in the prior quarter 2021. Our growth is strong across all the geographies. EMEA was up 9%, Asia Pac, 14%, LAC was up 15% -- 5%, as you noted in the U.S. Overall, good year-to-date growth of 9%. And whilst the 5% is a slowdown, it was 16% in Q3 of 2021. When we look at the U.S. over a longer period, the U.S. and Canada is 8% year-to-date and 13% in the full year of 2021. Canada is doing extremely well, and the U.S. growth last year in the back half of the year, there was exceptional performance in M&A, SPAC, and capital markets activity, and we don't see that repeating in the volatility of the markets going forward. We made fantastic investments last year in producers that are focused on recurring business, so we feel we're very well positioned in the U.S. going forward.
Daniel S. Glaser: So basically, a lot of activity last year in M&A particularly in the back half of last year, which is not repeating and so that's a bit of a headwind overall. So nothing concerning. Do you have a follow-up, Elyse?
Elyse Greenspan: Yes, thanks. My follow-up question is on the outlook for Guy Carpenter. You guys mentioned the loss that we saw from Hurricane Ian. From what we've been hearing, it really has the potential to turn on the catastrophe reinsurance market significantly next year. So what are you guys seeing there and can you just talk about how Guy Carpenter could benefit from a pretty hard reinsurance market in 2023?
Daniel S. Glaser: So why don't we start with John just to talk a little bit about the overall market, primary and reinsurance, and then we'll go to Dean. But John?
John Q. Doyle: Sure. Thanks, Dan. So Elyse, the insurance markets remained challenging in the third quarter for our clients. Prices continued to rise in the quarter, although moderating slightly overall from where we were in the second quarter. Reinsurance markets though, are a different -- really a different matter. The property cat market in particular was tightening in advance of Ian. And then as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're likely headed to a much more challenging January 1 reinsurance renewal. So with that, maybe I'll ask Dean to jump in on some of the details of what we're seeing in the market today.
Dean Klisura: Thanks, John. As we look forward, demand for our advice and solutions remains very strong, and we feel we're very well positioned to continue to create value for clients and grow our business moving forward. Demand for reinsurance, including cat properties, is expected to remain very strong as our clients manage volatility and continue to address systemic risk, including cyber and the impacts of climate change and the emerging perils we're seeing around flood, wildfire, and convective storms around the world continue to accelerate and concern our clients. The impact of Ian will certainly create challenging market conditions at January 1 in the property cat space. But as John noted, a tightening cat market could be a tailwind for Guy Carpenter, but we have a track record of strong growth in any market conditions.
John Q. Doyle: Terrific. Martin, maybe you could talk a little bit about what we're starting to see in terms of the impact of Ian on the property markets, if -- that Marsh operates in, and then just probably what's happening in pricing in the marketplace?
Martin South: Yes. Thanks, John. Well, we're into this -- into the 20th consecutive quarter of rate increases across the Board. We'll be announcing our rate survey at the end of -- in a couple of weeks' time. It will show 6% year-to-date in quarterly results in the property area. No question, there's going to be a strain in the property market, particularly for clients that have high cat exposures. We would have thought by now at this point in the cycle, after such consistent growth in property, that we have started to see some easing off. The reverse is going to be true, sadly, for our clients, going through for the back end of the year. Across the Board, though, rates, so I'll just -- I'll give you some color on those, John. The composite rate is 6%, which is down a little bit from the last quarter. Casualty is up 4% still, as I mentioned, property is 6%. FinPro [ph] lines are down 1%. They were heavily weighted in the prior year from -- and in the prior quarter from D&O SPACs and cyber. And we've broken out -- we will be breaking out cyber especially this year, which is showing rate increases of 53%, and that's down a little bit from rate increases in the prior quarter, but still very strong rate increases. And some of the activity we've seen there is slowing down a little bit. But it's a healthy market. But of course, we're worried about our clients. And as we said, we're going to be looking for solutions to plan them and we see that as a potential demand driver as well.
Daniel S. Glaser: Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan.
Jamminder Bhullar: Hey, good morning. I just had a question first on Oliver Wyman. I think there's concerns that if the economy slows down, that's a business that might be vulnerable to slower organic growth, but you've obviously had very strong results for the last several quarters. So if you could talk about what you're seeing in terms of pipeline and just what your expectations are for the business?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. As we've mentioned before, Oliver Wyman and Mercer's Career business are probably the most sensitive to the economic cycle, and it represents about 17% of our business. And both have been performing remarkably well over a long stretch of time. I mean, Mercer, as we mentioned earlier, Mercer's Career is up 15%, and it's their sixth quarter of double-digit growth in a row. And Oliver Wyman has had seven quarters of double-digit growth in a row. So if there are cloud somewhere in the future, we're not seeing them right today. But Nick, you want to give us more on Oliver Wyman?
Nick Studer: Thank you Jimmy, yes. It is true that our market tends to prosper when the economy is healthy. But at the same time, when all the questions change, our clients need nuances. And I will say we're not seeing any reversal in our business and our pipeline continues to be robust. As Dan and Martin both mentioned, the M&A and SPAC cycle, we have seen slower pace on the businesses that thrive on M&A activity, and I suspect we won't be immune to some of the tough elements in the cycle. But our client offerings are less pro-cyclical than they were perhaps five years ago. We have a strong capability in risk management, a lot of work in performance improvement, both top line and bottom line. We've established a restructuring practice, so -- and I'd add, it's actually been an incredibly tough environment for quite a few years now in several of the sectors we serve with the effects of the pandemic. So for now, the pipeline remains strong.
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes. And the other thing about it is that even though the Career business and Oliver Wyman are more sensitive, they actually bounced back a lot quicker post a down cycle. So they're great businesses, we're glad we're in them. And overall, they provide us with leading growth over long stretches of time, and we're not overly concerned with short first. Do you have a follow-up, Jimmy?
Jamminder Bhullar: Yes. Just on fiduciary investment income. It's up, I think, around 10 times what it was a year ago and almost three times the sequential quarter. So obviously, there's a benefit there from higher interest rates, but wondering if that's all it is? And should we assume that it goes up further as rates have gone even higher since the end of the quarter or was there any sort of discrete items that benefited the 3Q results?
Daniel S. Glaser: Well, it's nice to say it was up 10 times. It started from a very -- Mark, do you want to talk about fiduciary income?
Mark McGivney: Jimmy, there was nothing unusual or one-time in the results. So as you noted, we have $4 million a year ago in the third quarter, it was 40 million in this third quarter and it just reflects the rise in global rates, so it's definitely a source of upside for us. Obviously, we have balances all over the world, and so we're dependent on rates moving in different jurisdictions, but there's generally a trend up. And just remember, we've got over 10 billion of fiduciary balances on any given day, so 100 basis points equals 100 million of income.
Jamminder Bhullar: Noted. And good luck, and congratulations.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you very much, Jimmy. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: Hi, thanks, good morning. And Dan, congrats on the retirement. It's been quite a ride. Congrats.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thanks, David.
David Motemaden: Just had a question on the hiring activity that's been picking up. Obviously, the tough comp in the U.S. just on the M&A side in Marsh makes it a little tough to see any impact. But I was just wondering if you could just comment on how much this quarter benefited from some of the strategic hires that you've made over the last year and half, two years? And maybe give us a sense of how much that should ramp as we head into 2023?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes. So why don't we start with John, and maybe we'll go deeper. But John, why don't you take that?
John Q. Doyle: Sure, Dan. David, we're very, very pleased. We continue to be just absolutely pleased with the strat hiring that we did last year. Not only are they producing, but we did a lot of work as we are hiring these folks to make sure that they're a right cultural fit, and that's proven to be the case as well. So we started with world-class talent. We think the best talent in the markets that we serve, and these folks have made us better. We serve our clients and teams, and they've fit in very, very nicely at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter, where we did most of it. We did some of the hiring in Mercer as well. But Martin, maybe you could just talk about the productivity to the -- of the hires.
Martin South: John, thank you. And as you said, very, very happy with the investments that we made last year. We -- the cultural accretion to us has been significant. They've brought new skills, new insights to the firm, and they've spread it out like wildfire. We focus very heavily on the investments, as you know, in areas where we thought there was high recurring revenue growth to the point the question was, yes, we see these ramping up. Everything is penciling out exactly as we thought it would. In some areas, we're actually ahead of plan, so we continue to see this as a continuing add to our revenue or growth and our capabilities. Couldn't be happier.
John Q. Doyle: So as you know, David, it's two to three years before they are fully productive. But we couldn't be more pleased with the progress to date.
Daniel S. Glaser: I don't want to sound like a Hollywood agent, but it is about the talent. We're a people business. It's the smart, dedicated, creative people attract other smart, dedicated and creative people. So we've got a mountain of talent within the company, and we would continue to build upon that. Do you have a follow-up, David?
David Motemaden: I do, yes. And just on the property cat market on the reinsurance side, it sounds like that's spilling over a bit into cat exposed primary. I'm wondering if you're seeing that at all starting to spill over into non-property lines at all or if you expect that to happen?
John Q. Doyle: David, not at this point, and I would say I wouldn't expect that to happen. Of course, things are -- haven't even yet begun to settle, so there's a lot for us to learn. But as I noted in my prepared comments, this is a major, major loss, and so it will impact both the insurance and reinsurance markets, but principally in property.
David Motemaden: Understood, thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser: Next question please. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you very much. Good morning everybody and I also want to congratulate Dan on a phenomenal career, and good luck in retirement. And good luck to John as well. Tough act to follow. I guess first question, going back to the reinsurance market and maybe the dislocation we're seeing in Florida, and more broadly in property cat. So I think I understand the rate environment, but at the same time, we're also hearing about maybe a dearth of capital, private reinsurance pulling out of the market, maybe public markets looking to take on some of that bucket, if you will. I guess, how are you envisioning the supply issue and how much of an impact could that have on overall growth next year? And related to that, I would think that a lot of your colleagues have actually never experienced a real hard market and certainly in Guy Carpenter. So how are you preparing them to address this new environment?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, that's a good series of questions, and it's certainly something that's been at the executive team table as we think through how to serve clients in this kind of environment. We've been in tough markets before, but your basic point about supply and demand, yes. Demand will outstrip supply. It's already outstripping supply, so it's just an extent of how quickly the market can adapt to that. Dean, do you want to give us more?
Dean Klisura: Sure. Maybe I'll give you a little more color. Thanks, Dan. As John noted earlier, Ian's impact on already strapped property market could be significant. Prior to Ian, right, there seemed like there was increased demand from clients to absorb inflation and recent losses in the market, so we're already starting to feel that one-one stress. And as John noted, following Ian, we're really starting to see the property cat market tighten particularly in the U.S., with potential supply and balances in the marketplace. As you know, it's the third year in a row of $100 billion of cat losses in the market. And I would say it's going to be more, potentially more than just rate increases for U.S. cat exposed clients, right. Increased retentions, changes in coverage in terms, reduced capacity from individual players, and also the impact from the retrocession market, which could be significantly impacted as well. Some are discussing 25% of the retrocession capital being trapped by Ian and the market, and not replenished for January 1. So certainly, we've got some stresses there. However, I would say we're working very closely with our clients, leveraging our deep expertise in the market to work closely with clients to deliver successful incomes, and we're investigating new capacity in the marketplace. We've been working for several months with players around the world to bring more capital, more interest into the cat market on behalf of our clients.
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, absolutely. And so it's one of those things, very tough markets really, in some ways, it's the period where Marsh McLennan shines the most. And so Guy Carpenter will do well but in any time where there's supply and demand imbalances you could have short-term pressures of something not being able to be placed, because there's not enough capital providers willing to write a particular line of business. But solutions will be found, and we're actively working for our clients in that area. Any follow-up Yaron, although you asked about four questions. Give me another one, if you have one at the ready.
Yaron Kinar: I have one more, hopefully, shorter. Cyber, you mentioned very strong rate increases. I think that's also a continuation of a couple of years of strong rate improvement. That said, my understanding is that 2022 is starting to -- the loss experience is starting to moderate. How are you envisioning 2023 as far as rate increases and maybe increased demand, if rate increases are slower?
Daniel S. Glaser: John?
John Q. Doyle: Yes, Yaron, I'm going to forecast the pricing environment for cyber. Price increases are moderating. I think you used the word improving, but I'm not sure our clients would -- at Marsh, would consider it an improving rate environment. We've had a lot of rate on rate. It's been a difficult market. What I would also note about cyber, well, ransomware, to some extent, I think, reflective of the reduction in ransomware in recent quarters. Underwriters have also responded to ransomware through higher retentions, lower limits, for example. Longer term, though, the cyber market is not near maturity. And so we're still working to bring more capital to the market, better solutions to the marketplace. But the cyber insurance market should be an area of growth for us for some time as we help our clients navigate the risks of a digital economy.
Daniel S. Glaser: Absolutely. Next question please. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Thanks, good morning, and I want to add my congratulations to Dan. I remember where Marsh was when you first came on board. You've done an absolutely phenomenal job.
Daniel S. Glaser: I had your headline from November of 2007, what else could go wrong? A statement, not a question. That was on my bulletin board for about five years there.
Meyer Shields: Well yes. Anyhow, quick question. Look, I'm trying to decipher how much politics is real. But a fair amount of opposition brewing in some parts of the country to ESG, and I'm wondering how that's impacting demand for ESG-related consulting?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. It's a great question. We're reading the same reports. Why don't we go first to Martine to talk a little bit about the Mercer investment side of the business and other areas of Mercer that are impacted, or that markets in ESG? And then we'll hand over to Nick Studer as well. But Martine?
Martine Ferland: Yes, for sure. And thanks, Meyer, for the question. For us at Mercer in terms of environmental and social and governance, actually, we can work with clients on all three fronts; low-carbon economy, the transitions, sustainable investment. We help clients wherever they are in their philosophy of investment and their objectives to look at the market and the best risk and rewards [ph]. So our clients invest for the long run, and they look at the risk elements of their investment. And it's with that length that we're looking at the ESG factors with them. We don't see that kind of demand and necessity to look at risk. I mean, all through the Q&A today, we have talked about climate risk, for example. So we need to figure -- factor these risks in when we look at investment in all our clients get the returns that they're looking for. Other elements, of course, CE&I, social minimum standards of benefit across the world, so we pay equity. We have a lot of work there with our clients that are focused very much on building diverse workforces and the whole governance elements around it. Whether it goes from executive compensation, to the way that they manage and govern their investment. Actually coming back to investment, it's been quite a rough year on the capital market this new year. But we've been working with clients and actually, we've been very busy on the -- consulting side of the house, in particular, to help client navigate that very intense headwinds and volatility in capital markets.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thanks. Nick?
Nick Studer: Yes. I mean, and Meyer, in Oliver Wyman, the main focus of the three would be around the climate transition, and I think that backlash that you're seeing in some places is something we've expected for quite a while. There is a delicate balance to strike in -- especially the carbon transition between security and affordability, and the transition itself. But ultimately, when many sectors are trying to reverse engineer 200 years since Industrial Revolution in 20 years, there'll be actions which overshoot, there will be actions which take on greater resistance. But as it affects our business, our climate of sustainability practice is one of the fastest-growing areas of Oliver Wyman, most investment we've made over the last three or four years, and it continues to grow in the very high double digits. We're not seeing any reduction in demand. We are seeing that the questions are getting more...
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes. Thank you. Any follow-up?
Meyer Shields: Yes, just a brief one, maybe this is for Mark. I was hoping you could talk us through capital deployment plans as the cost of capital is reflected in the risk-free rate rises?
Mark McGivney: Yes. Meyer, I don't -- even though interest rates have come up and obviously, the weighted average cost of capital for the firm has come up as a result, we tend to value balance and consistency in our approaches, and they've served us well over a long period of time. So even though things have gotten a little more expensive in economic terms, it isn't enough to make us change our fundamental views on capital allocation, capital structure, things like that. When it comes to M&A, we've held ourselves to much higher return standards than our weighted average cost of capital consistently, and we'll continue to do that. But I don't think there's anything about the current environment that makes us change our basic strategy.
Meyer Shields: Thanks.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Cox: Hey, thanks for taking my question. So Latin America and Asia Pacific have been particularly strong. I was wondering if we could get a little more color on what's driving that relative to the U.S., is it higher inflation, higher pricing, market share gains, anything -- any color on that would be great?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. We'll begin with Martin in a second. I mean, in general, what we've seen in -- over, really, the last couple of decades is that you not only have regular higher levels of growth and a bit more inflation sometimes over long stretches of time in places like Asia and Latin America, but you also have increased insurance penetration. As the economy develops insurance becomes the underpinning for development, and so that has always been a benefit to us as well. Martin, do you want to give us more?
Martin South: Yes. Thank you. And look, for the last few years as well, you've seen international has been slightly weaker than the U.S. That's rebounding, and we best to balance things so strong in our portfolio, so we're really pleased with the overall balance in our business. As Dan said, for Asia Pacific, very strong growth of 14%. We have a terrific franchise in Asia Pacific, pretty well unrivaled positions in almost all the markets there. So you could not buy what we have in that market. It's a mixture of in Japan, maturities and us having been there for such a long period of time and building the trust with the local community, and the carriers and doing more indigenous business. It's the protection gap that you see across Southeast Asia that's giving us share, it's strength in our benefits business across Asia, and the same for Latin America. We have an unbelievable franchise there, very strong businesses in all the big geographies in all the big markets in Latin America. There's some great strength there, but it's been relatively modest for a while. It's really a question of just getting market share and strength and a terrific leadership team.
John Q. Doyle: And Dan, I would add that JLT made us stronger in both regions as well. Absolutely.
Daniel S. Glaser: Any follow-up, Robert?
Robert Cox: Yes. Thanks, that's very helpful. And I just had a follow-up on Career. So there's been some favorable trends in Career driven by some of the changing dynamics in the labor market. How sustainable are those trends if unemployment rises a couple of points, could you still see strong growth given those underlying changes, or is that too optimistic?
Daniel S. Glaser: Martine?
Martine Ferland: Yes. Thank you for the question, Robert. No, it's a good question. There's no doubt that coming out of the pandemic, the world of work has completely changed, and that has driven demand. But you look at all that's currently playing out, whether it's high inflation, it's labor shortage, it's emerging new skills that we have to help clients gravitate to reorganizing the way that you work. So we have talked before about the impact that recession has had in the past on the Career Services business. There's also the Career Product business, about half and half of revenue in that space. Career Product is actually more resilient through recessions. And Career Services, given the fundamentals that we see in the market today, we currently don't see any slowdown. Clients are really needing help to navigate all of the changes. We're not immune to a change in economic pace, but we rebound quickly, and we've -- we'll carry through. So, so far, so good.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you. Next question please. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith: Yes, thanks. And also just want to congratulate to Dan, and I want to echo Meyer's comments. It's an absolute pleasure watching you lead this organization for the last decade. Question for you first, M&A. What does the pipeline look like right now and particularly, as we kind of look at M&A here with private equity may be cooling off a little bit here, becoming a little more challenging, are you seeing a better pipeline here? And I'm assuming that John wants to outdo you on JLT here pretty quickly?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes. Looking at his chops over there. No, the M&A pipeline is good. We -- as we've said a few times before in the past, we cultivate relationships over long stretches of time. We're less interested in the call from a banker saying, hey, something's going to market, we're inviting 10 people. You want to participate? And so for us, pipeline development and meeting as a core executive team on a regular cadence to review the pipeline and talk to potential prospects in the future, that's just a part of how we go about the business. As you know, we favor building our business through acquisition over share repurchase, but they sort of go in tandem. When we have a lighter year in M&A, we'll have more share repurchase sort of like this year when we have a heavy year in M&A, we'd have less share repurchase because our dividend is -- comes first and is sacrosanct. So when we look at the pipeline, the pipeline is good. We have a transaction that we've mentioned to you before in BT Westpac [ph] which won't close until next year. But still when we're thinking about the utilization of our capital, we're pretty much thinking that it's kind of well, it's partly this year and its partly next year regardless of when the cash goes out the door. And as you know, we've sort of average, if you exclude JLT, we've sort of averaged about $1 billion a year on acquisitions, and that's likely to continue.
Brian Meredith: Makes sense. Thanks. And then a quick follow-up here for Mark. Mark, any initial kind of thoughts on what the net benefit from pension could look like in 2023, given the big rise we've seen -- interest rates?
Mark McGivney: Brian, it's just really too early to tell. There's so much that goes into that that calculation of the other net benefit credit. It's really not until we see, with Mercer's great help, of course, the outlook for expected returns and our year-end valuation that we really formulate a view on that. So I think when we were back together in January, I'll have a perspective then. 
Brian Meredith: Great, thank you. 
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, take care. Next question please. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.
Michael Phillips: Thanks, good morning. First question is still back on the theme of property cat reinsurance, guys. How much of a real risk has it been that some business just simply is not going to get placed at the beginning of the year? And then how material could that be?
Daniel S. Glaser: John, do you want to start with that?
John Q. Doyle: Yes, Mike, happy to jump back in on this. Again, it's still quite early, and so I think most reinsurers and insurers are planning and trying to decide how to best deploy capital going forward. As we, Dean and Dan and I have all discussed, we expect some level of disruption. It's going to be a challenging market. But again, we're using the capabilities of our entire firm to bring solutions to the market. Data and analytics, new investors, new facilities. And in some cases, it may mean clients retaining more risk, both insurers but also our retail clients as well. And we're the global leader in managing captives on behalf of our clients, and so it's an example. Now some of our clients may be pushed by the market to do that, and some may choose just given what might be elevated pricing, may more elect themselves to retain more risk. So we're going to work with them to help all of our clients accomplish their risk management goals.
Michael Phillips: Okay, thank you. And then as you said, the property cat market was certainly hardening a bit before Ian, I think we were here in kind of low single digits -- I'm sorry, double-digit, but now we're hearing pretty massive increases. The question is, is that strict -- are those levels that we're hearing, pick a number, 30%, 40%, 50%, I don't care the number you would pick, but is that strictly just Florida or do you see such levels as well outside of Florida around the world?
John Q. Doyle: Well, Mike, I think what you've seen over the last several years is cat losses have exceeded modeled estimates. So the market is underpriced, insurers and reinsurers broadly have underpriced the risk over that period of time, right. You can look at an extended period of time and, of course, get different outcomes. So the market is reacting to that. So you've also had an escalation of values that's happened in many cat-exposed markets as well. And then broadly speaking, inflation, creating some challenges.  So as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're heading to meaningful rate change prior to Ian in the 20%, 25% plus of range to cover inflation and against just the elevated weather-related events over the last several years. Now it's likely to, of course, be higher than that. And so in talking to reinsurers and insurers they're thinking about, again, about how to best deploy their capital going forward. They're in the business of taking these risks and will ultimately make choices about where to best deploy that capital. And what they're saying today is they want to reserve it for their best clients. On the reinsurance side, that might mean clients that they also support them in casualty and other lines as an example. And so thinking about Marsh for a second, it's an interesting market. We have a high net worth personal lines support inside of M&A, important business to us. This loss is going to be more of a small business and personal line loss, and so it won't impact our major accounts and really as much as other events have.
Michael Phillips: Okay, thank you for the color. I appreciate it. 
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.
Ryan Tunis: Hey guys, good morning. Just a follow-up on the fiduciary investment income. So we've had a number of years of really strong margin expansion where that hasn't played a role at all. Is it right, am I thinking about this right that this should be a kind of a separate and distinct margin tailwind on top of the type of margin expansion that we've seen over the past decade or is there investment potentially against some of that investment income? 
Daniel S. Glaser: I mean, you're basically right in that fiduciary income, we didn't have. A lot of it is -- drops to the bottom line. So a lot of it is profit, and that will help margins in the future.
Ryan Tunis: Perfect. And then a follow-up, I guess, for Martine, just in wealth, is there -- is there any way you can quantify with markets rolling over the type of impact that's having on organic growth?
Daniel S. Glaser: Please.
Martine Ferland: Yes. No, thanks, Ryan. It has an impact. We commented on it, and as you can imagine, it's our what we call our OCIO business where we are paid in this point of the assets under management. It has been a very good business to us. It's been growing rapidly, but it is exposed to short-term volatility from capital markets. And based on the market value that we see at the end of Q3, we do expect a drag from capital markets to continue in the fourth quarter, as a reference, and I think we alluded to that in our script. In Q3, this has cost us about two points of margin at Mercer, four points on Wealth. [Multiple Speakers].
Daniel S. Glaser: So Mercer would have been more like a 7 instead of a 5, not 4.
Martine Ferland: Yes. And we had 15% in Career and 10% in health, rounding this up. And also, it does help us on the DB [ph] consulting side where we consult with client when there's such impact on the capital market. Our portfolio is diversified, so that helps. We had also a great net -- coming to our funds, which will [Technical Difficulty].
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. So it's a terrific business, Ryan. As we noted, the assets under delegated management are down about 20% year-over-year. But having said that, if you look over the decade -- over a decade, the CAGR on assets under delegated management is about a 20% number on a CAGR basis. So it's a great business. We're glad we're in it. But obviously, it's a headwind in the short term. Hopefully, in the short term.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan, for any closing remarks.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, and thank you for joining us on the call this morning. I want to thank our 86,000 colleagues for their commitment, hard work, and dedication to Marsh McLennan. And from the bottom of my heart, thank you for the trust you have put in me. Serving as CEO of Marsh McLennan has been an honor. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-21 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh McLennanâs Second Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. Todayâs call is being recorded. Second quarter 2022 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the companyâs website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter into our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in todayâs earnings release.  Iâll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.
Dan Glaser: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. Iâm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is John Doyle, our Group President and COO; Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh McLennanâs second quarter was outstanding. Top line momentum continued to cross our business, extending our strongest run of quarterly underlying growth in over two decades. We generated robust top and bottom line results topping tough comparables in the prior year. Underlying growth of 10% in the quarter reflects considerable strength across our organization. It represents the fifth consecutive quarter of 10% or higher top line growth, building on 13% growth a year ago. Adjusted operating income of $1.3 billion was a second quarter record and grew 8% on top of 24% in the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted EPS growth of 8% is notable given our 33% growth in the second quarter of 2021, costs related to our strategic talent investments and the rebound of expenses such as T&E. We also completed the highest level of quarterly share repurchases in over a decade, buying back $600 million of stock. Overall, our second quarter performance reflects the strength of Marsh McLennan, the relevance of what we do and the expertise of our colleagues. Iâm pleased with the momentum of our second quarter results, especially when viewed in the context of a macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop that has become increasingly tense over the course of the year. Entering 2022, the outlook was cautiously optimistic, reflecting expectations for above average GDP growth. Fast forward to today and we hear more about the rising risk of recession, the highest inflation in two generations, geopolitical tumult, central bank hawkishness and bear markets and risk assets. We have proven to be a resilient firm and we are prepared to act as conditions warrant. However, in the current environment, we believe it is worth noting some nuances to the macro story that remains supportive of our growth. While the real GDP growth outlook has softened, the outlook for inflation has risen. These two factors have somewhat offsetting impacts on insurance premiums. Even if GDP growth softens as predicted, higher inflation will increase insured values and likely cause higher loss costs. Additionally, P&C insurance pricing conditions remain firm, we are helping clients navigate an environment where underwriters remain cautious about where and how they deploy capital and terms and conditions are tight in some product lines. Insurers also continue to account for the rising frequency and severity of catastrophe losses, the risk of social inflation and firmer reinsurance market. Looking at the health benefits and workforce sectors, the U.S. labor market remains among the tightest employment environments of the past half century. Even if it has tempered at the margins, the U.S. unemployment rate is back to pre-pandemic lows and yet over 11 million jobs remain unfilled. And short-term interest rates are rising due to central bank tightening, which will be a benefit to fiduciary income. Importantly, we are in the business of risk, strategy and people when the world is unsettled demand for our services rises. We are helping our clients adapt to this rapidly changing landscape and navigate long-term challenges as well as opportunities. We are increasingly harnessing the collective power of our firm to guide clients as they deal with issues such as geopolitical risk, the pandemic, cyber threats, global supply chain disruptions, capital markets volatility, climate change, tight labor markets and new ways of working. Even if a recession does emerge, Marsh McLennan is well positioned to perform through the economic cycle. Since we went public in 1962, we have grown EPS during all recessionary periods. Most notably in the severe recessions that accompanied the global financial crisis and the pandemic in 2020. We have demonstrated our ability to manage the expense base in both good and tough times and run our business to grow revenues faster than expenses. We have reported adjusted operating margin improvement for 14 consecutive years. We also have a track record of delivering today, while investing for the future. This includes generating attractive financial performance, while at the same time investing in our talent and capabilities. Overall, I am proud of how we are executing and delivering for clients today and we continue to believe that over the long-term demand for our advice and solutions will remain strong, given rising levels of complexity, volatility and uncertainty across the business landscape. With that, let me turn it over to John for his comments on the quarter.
John Doyle: Thanks, Dan and good morning everyone. Our second quarter results were outstanding. We had 10% underlying revenue growth with momentum across the business and our adjusted operating income set a second quarter record. Iâm pleased with our performance and grateful to our colleagues for the value they deliver to our clients, communities and shareholders. Before I discuss market trends and our performance, I want to comment on the ways in which we are harnessing the collective strength of Marsh McLennan. We are finding the intersections where we bring unique capabilities to serve our clients. Earlier this year, I mentioned that I was meeting with our colleagues to identify areas where we can have greater client impact as well as accelerate our growth. These conversations have yielded a range of ideas to drive innovation, deliver critical client solutions, become more agile and efficient and growth and value for shareholders. Year to date, we have generated a significant number of wins involving two or more Marsh McLennan businesses and every day we see more potential to succeed together. Let me share a few recent examples. Marsh and Oliver Wyman helped a regional healthcare client with a broad enterprise risk management strategy. Knowing Marsh has this capability Oliver Wyman involved them in the engagement. The client was so pleased with the value of the team delivered that a further opportunity was created for Mercer to consult on workforce issues. Marsh and Mercer engaged a higher education client in the United States about enterprise risk management. The client valued our expertise and ability to facilitate conversations about total risk across all lines of insurance. As a result, Marsh was awarded the property and casualty insurance program and Mercer secured the student health, travel and athletics business. The client has since engaged the joint team about expanding additional lines of coverage. Guy Carpenter and Oliver Wyman also came together recently to help a large U.S. insurer with strategic advice to reposition a core product. The successful collaboration is expected to lead to additional business and further opportunities to partner on future projects. These are just a few examples of the ways we are helping clients grow faster and become more resilient. Now let me provide an update on current P&C insurance market conditions. Rate increases in the marketplace persist along with continued concerns around the impact of inflation on loss cost and a tightening reinsurance market. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 9% year-over-year. This marks the 19th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace. Looking at pricing by line, the Marsh Market Index showed both global property insurance and global casualty rates up 6% on average. Global financial and professional lines, excluding cyber increased low single digits, while cyber rates rose nearly 80% in some geographies. As a reminder, our index skews the large account business. However, small and middle market insurance rates continue to rise as well, although less than for large complex accounts. Turning to reinsurance. Guy Carpenterâs U.S. Property Catastrophe Rate on Line Index showed increases of approximately 15% through midyear, the largest increase since 2006. Midyear renewals reflected one of the most challenging property markets in many years with pricing driven by inflation, escalating geopolitical risk and loss experience. Throughout the first half of the year, we saw some reinsurers take tougher positions on specific terms and conditions and shift portfolios to limit capacity in certain lines of business or geographies. We remain focused on helping our clients navigate these challenging insurance and reinsurance markets and the heightened risk environment. Turning to our performance in the quarter. As I noted earlier, Marsh McLennan had excellent results. In the second quarter, we had 10% underlying revenue growth with 9% in RIS and 10% in consulting. This is a fantastic result considering the prior year second quarter underlying growth was 13%. Bottom line results were strong as well with adjusted operating income growth of 8% in the quarter compared to 24% growth a year ago. Looking at risk and insurance services. Second quarter revenue was a record $3.3 billion, up 5% compared with a year ago or 9% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 9% to a second quarter record of $1 billion and our adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 32.8%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.8 billion, up 5% compared with a year ago. Revenue growth was 9% on an underlying basis and supported by strong renewal growth and new business. U.S. and Canada had 10% underlying revenue growth. This marks U.S. and Canadaâs fifth consecutive quarter of double digit underlying revenue growth. International was also strong with underlying growth of 9%. Latin America grew 14%, Asia Pacific was up 11% and EMEA was up 7%. Guy Carpenterâs second quarter revenue was $522 million up 9% on an underlying basis driven by strong retention in new business as well as rate increases, which continued at midyear. Guy Carpenter has now achieved underlying revenue growth of 9% or higher in four of the last five quarters. In the Consulting segment revenue was $2.1 billion and up 10% from a year ago on both a reported and underlying basis. This is Consultingâs fifth consecutive quarter of double digit underlying revenue growth. Adjusted operating income increased 4% to a second quarter high of $369 million. The adjusted operating margin was 19.3% down 20 basis points versus a year ago. Mercerâs revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter up 7% on an underlying basis. Career grew 17% on an underlying basis, a record since we began reporting this line of business. We continue to see robust demand for solutions linked to workforce transformation and compensation and rewards. Health underlying revenue growth was also excellent at 10% in the quarter, reflecting growth across all geographies. This quarterâs results continue to benefit from strong demand for our solutions, accelerating new business, higher retention, increased enrolled lives from a strong labor market and medical inflation. Wealth increased wealth increase 1% on an underlying basis. Reflecting modest growth and defined benefits, which offset a modest decline in investments. Our assets under management were $346 billion at the end of the second quarter down 12% from the prior year reflecting capital market and foreign exchange headwinds. In May, Mercer announced an agreement with Westpac to acquire BT Super Trust and advanced Asset Management Australia. This will create a $45 billion Mercer fund helping more than 850,000 Australians invest for retirement. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2023. Oliver Wyman strong momentum continued. Revenue in the second quarter was $695 million, an increase of 16% on an underlying basis. This follows a 28% comparable in the second quarter of 2021 and reflects continued spend across all geographies. Overall, Iâm proud of our second quarter performance, which demonstrates the continued momentum across our business, despite a more uncertain macro environment. Now Iâll turn the call over to Mark for further detail on our financial results and a discussion of our outlook for the rest of 2022.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, John and good morning. As Dan and John mentioned our strong financial performance in the second quarter reflects continued momentum across our business. We saw another quarter of double underlying revenue growth and meaningful earnings growth despite tough prior year revenue and expense comparisons. We generated GAAP EPS of $1.91 in the quarter and adjusted EPS of $1.89 up 8% from a year ago. This comes on top of adjusted EPS growth of 33% in the second quarter of last year. Operating income was $1.4 billion and adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion. Our adjusted operating margin was 26.7% in the second quarter up 30 basis points year-over-year. John covered our business operating results. So Iâll cover some of the other aspects of our performance and outlook. Adjusted corporate expense was $62 million in the second quarter. Based on our current outlook, we expect approximately $142 million for the second half of the year. Foreign exchange was a headwind of $0.03 to our adjusted due to the strength of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies. Year-to-date foreign exchange represents $0.07 headwind. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels. We expect FX to be a headwind of $0.01 in the third quarter and $0.05 in the fourth quarter. Our other net benefit credit was $59 million in the quarter. For the full year 2022, we expect our other net benefit credit will be about $240 million. Investment income was $2 million in the second quarter on a GAAP basis and $3 million on an adjusted basis and mainly reflects gains in our private equity portfolio. Interest expense in the second quarter was $114 million compared to $110 million in the second quarter of 2021. Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense to be about $118 million in each of the third and fourth quarters. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 23.7% compared with 24.4% in the second quarter of last year. The lower rate this quarter was driven by a decline in our underlying tax rate to 25% from 25.5% a year ago. Our tax rate in the quarter also included a benefit from favorable discrete items, the largest of which related to stock compensation. When we give forward guidance tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume an adjusted effective tax rate of around 25% for 2022. Turning to capital management, our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total debt of $11.8 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity is March of 2023, when $350 million of senior notes mature. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital in 2022 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases, the ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how our M&A pipeline develops. Last week, we raised our quarterly dividend 10% marking our 13th consecutive year of dividend increases. In the second quarter, we bought back 3.8 million shares of our stock for $600 million reflecting our strong financial position and outlook for cash generation. Our acquisition pipeline remains active. As John mentioned, we recently announced Mercerâs agreement with Westpac to combine the BT and Mercer Super Trust in Australia. We are also looking forward to Mercerâs acquisition of Advanced Asset Management from Westpac. We are excited about these deals and how they extend Mercerâs leading position in OCIO. Our cash position at the end of this quarter was $909 million. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1.1 billion and included $275 million for dividends, $232 million for acquisitions and $600 million for share repurchases. For the first six months uses of cash totaled $1.9 billion and included $547 million for dividends, $273 million for acquisitions and $1.1 billion for share repurchases. Regarding the outlook for the rest of 2022, we remain on track for a terrific year. Our top line comps get tougher in the second half, and thereâs greater uncertainty in the macro outlook. However, with our strong first half, we see underlying growth at the upper end of our full-year guidance of mid single digits or higher. We also continue to expect margin expansion for the full year and solid growth in adjusted EPS. With that, Iâm happy to turn it back to Dan.
Dan Glaser: Thanks Mark. Richard, weâre ready to begin Q&A.
Operator:  And our first question online comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I was hoping to just get some color on the impact of the new hires this quarter. I think last quarter you see an impact in Guy Carpenter. Did that continue and did Marsh also see a benefit in the second quarter?
Dan Glaser: Yeah, I mean as Iâve said before, Elyse and good morning to you as well. At Marsh McLennan, weâre largely focused on building our capabilities and building our talent. Itâs all about the talent. Itâs not necessarily all about, well, what kind of book of business or what kind of production does that individual drive and how quickly can they get to know with our distribution, our client base, the prospects that we go after in the complexity of the world, that there will be plenty of opportunities to get our talent engaged. Now having said that, yes, last year we had a strategy to build our talent base for a variety of different reasons, we arrived at that strategy. So itâs a little bit more acute in terms of how does it translate to revenue and obviously itâs revenue from us right now across the firm. But John, you want to give a little bit more detail about what youâre seeing from the new hires?
John Doyle: Sure, Dan. Yeah, at least weâre very pleased with the hiring we did last year. As you know, we capitalized on our brand as â our strong brand as an employer in the marketplace and some market dislocation. And itâs worked out exceedingly well for us. Our focus this year has been onboarding that talent and a success and bringing them to a level of productivity. As we noted last quarter, Guy Carpenter, the impact on Guy Carpenter was a bit earlier as expected than it will be at Marsh, but the talent we brought in has been very, very helpful at Marsh as well. We serve our clients in teams. And I think one of the things that feels particularly good about is just the cultural fit of these new colleagues, itâs worked out very, very well. So weâre on target from productivity. We slightly ahead and we feel terrific about the investments we made.
Dan Glaser: And I think itâs really important, Johnâs comment about that we serve clients in teams. Thatâs what we do. So thereâs not a number on an individualâs back of what they have to produce in a given timeframe. Weâve built the capabilities of the firm, and that is a lasting basis of increasing value that we provide to clients. Do you have a follow-up?
Elyse Greenspan: Yeah, thanks. My follow-up, so Dan you kicked off the call discussing the potential impact of a recession. You also highlighted that inflation could be a benefit as well as the still good commercial pricing. So if we do enter into a recession, whether thatâs later this year or in 2023, is that an environment when you think about those moving pieces that Marsh McLennan can still continue to hit that mid single digit organic growth target?
Dan Glaser: Yeah. Iâm not going to give you guidance about our revenue next year or later. I mean, I do think itâs important to note that in all past recessions, since 1962, we grew adjusted EPS and we know how to run a business in good times and in bad times. And weâve proven to be a very resilient firm. Now, there is certainly uncertainty about the economic outlook and big deal to be concerned about on a macro basis and a geopolitical basis in the world today. I mean, thatâs to be sure. But as I noted in the script, there are other factors which tend to support our growth. And whether itâs strong demand for our services in difficult times, whether its inflation, as you mentioned, higher interest rates, which are direct benefit to fiduciary income and profitability, and the insurance market is firm, its firm and if anything, reinsurance on the property side is even tightening. So we feel good about where we are positioned now. As weâve seen in past recessions, you could see the most discretionary parts of our business are Oliver Wyman and Mercer Career. You take them together, itâs about 16% or 17% of the total firm, and they tend to be impacted the quickest in downturn. However right now their performance has been remarkably strong in both Oliver Wyman and Mercer Career, and their pipelines remain strong. So the red flag is not going up quite yet, but we watch it carefully.
John Doyle: You know, Dan, maybe one more thing to throw in, at least you talked about inflation and pricing in the commercial P&C market, a better asked about that, but our revenue line is also exposed to medical inflation. I noted that in my prepared remarks, but medical inflation also is a tailwind for us.
Dan Glaser: Thatâs a good point. Next question, please.
Operator:  Our next one comes from Mr. Robert Cox from Goldman Sachs.
Robert Cox: Hey, thanks for taking my question. So yeah, my first one, I just wanted to ask about the environment and noting that, some notable companies have come out and said things like theyâre being more cautious in with respect to hiring and maybe slowing spend on professional fees. So, I mean, you just touched on it a little bit, but are you seeing any of that in the impact on your runway for project related work? I guess, particularly with respect to Oliver Wyman?
Dan Glaser: No, I mean, Iâll hand off to Nick in a second, but Oliver Wymanâs performance has been very strong. Pipelines still look good. Theyâre getting a lot of looks across different areas. Everything from efficiency plays to growth plays. And so Nick, you want to give us a little bit more.
Nick Studer: Yeah. Dan, I mean, I think you summarized it well, Robert, thanks for the question. We are delighted with the continued progress really across all four of our regions weâve been in double digit growth and the pipeline looks robust in all four of them. We have 12 different industry practices. The majority of those have been in double digit growth led by energy, by healthcare and life sciences, by retail banking, automotive and manufacturing and private capital. And Dan gave the nod to the broad range of capabilities that weâre seeing working again, led by some of our organizational effectiveness and operational efficiency work, but also restructuring, also finance and risk. There is quite a few countercyclical offerings in there. So we do think over time that sort of mid to high single digit growth will be all through the cycle average. And itâs obviously been faster recently. But the pipeline still looks good as Dan mentioned.
Dan Glaser: And Robert, one thing that Iâll just mention, in your question around hiring or the caution around hiring within our client base, I mean as you can see, itâs been a very tight labor market, particularly in the United States. Companies are very focused on how to attract and retain colleagues and they engage Mercer regularly in that. And in respect to Marsh McLennan, specifically, our hiring last year where we had 6,000 net hiring, the timing of that in retrospect is really pretty perfect entering the environment that we are in today. And we have gone back to our more normal pattern of hiring. Itâs not caution, I would say itâs just a recognition that we had a large degree of hiring last year and our hiring pace this year is very consistent with our hiring that we did in say 2017, 2018, 2019 if you look at those in the aggregate year-by-year on CAGR basis. And so itâs kind of back to normal on the hiring front, do you have a follow up Robert?
Robert Cox: Hey, yeah. So just with the, with respect to those comments, as you think about a potential recession, those hires that you made in 2021, thereâs certainly some tailwinds for the brokerage business right now, is that â are those tailwinds enough to kind have that talent base hold their own in a recessionary environment? Or would you look at that and say this is going to be a margin headwind?
Dan Glaser: No, weâve grown our margins in good times and in bad times. And certainly this is our â this will be our 15th year of margin expansion because itâs fundamentally philosophically the way we run the business. We grow revenues at a faster pace than we grow expenses. And so our margins will go up on that basis. Now, our underlying levels of growth have a big impact, the higher the levels of growth, that we see next year, the year after the more weâll be able to think about margins, the tighter levels of growth would make those things more difficult. But weâre a company that can perform in good times and in bad times. And so things like recessions, theyâre a natural form of the economic cycle in a capitalist society. So we donât fret over that and we donât plan all that much around it. Weâll run our business and weâll deliver fine results and weâll continue to invest as we go. Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Jimmy Bhullar from J.P. Morgan.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hey, good morning. So first, I just had a question following up on your comments on the pricing environment. Are you seeing any changes on the parts of your clients in response to higher pricing, both in the primary side and also in reinsurance?
Dan Glaser: So John, why donât you take that one?
John Doyle: Sure. Jimmy, just a little bit of background and Iâll ask Martin and Dean to talk about some of the marketplace, some observations they have around the current marketplace. So, as I said earlier, prices reining up in both insurance and re-insurance. Insurers and reinsurers remain concerned about elevated cat losses over the last several years, including secondary perils. Theyâre spending a lot of time better modeling and understanding secondary perils. Inflation, both core inflation but their concerns about social inflation as well. And then the frequency of large losses, insurers led the turn in the market several years ago. Now reinsurers are pressing on pricing and terms and conditions. So the things have changed a bit, but as I mentioned, retail pricing, insurance pricing remains up. Martin, maybe Iâd ask you to share some observations first, and then weâll ask Dean to talk about whatâs going on in the reinsurance market.
Martin South: Thank you, John. Well, the risk of repeating things just to get some numbers squared away, pricing is strong in second quarter, which is very challenging for our clients is as the question noted. Rates continue to moderate though, in the course, which is good news for our clients, FINPRO rates are up 16%, which is really driven by cyber core FINPRO. Itâs actually flattish and cyber is driving growth there, property up 6%, casualty up 6%, which is just upper take over the prior quarter. And so those are the real drivers for it. Itâs difficult to see any inflationary impacts in the rates, although itâs possible that we got a declining rate increase which would have been faster in a normal inflationary environment. And of course, our clients have some options. We manage some captives and theyâre able to retain more risk in their captive to deal with those issues.
John Doyle: Thanks. Good. Thank you, Martin. And Dean, as I noted in my prepared remarks, thereâs some segments of the reinsurance market are capacity constraints, maybe you can touch on that as you share some observations with Jimmy.
Dean Klisura: Yes. Thanks, John. Jimmy, I would say in terms of the reinsurance renewal, the first half as John noted was the most challenging property market we have seen in a number of years. John noted U.S. property cat rates increasing 15% on average through the first half of the year. The largest increase weâve seen since 2006, the June one mid-year renewal was particularly challenging as we saw property cat capacity really constrained globally with particular challenge in the U.S. and London wholesale market. John and Dan, both noted many of the macro influences impacting the reinsurance market on the property side, including rising inflation, uncertainty from the Russia-Ukraine war, climate change anxiety on behalf of our clients and reinsurers, the continued increase in global cat losses and certainly reduced retrocession protections on behalf of our reinsurers. That being said to your question, demand for our advice and solutions remains very strong as our clients try to manage volatility on their balance sheets and our clients are seeking strategic advice on systemic risk. And John mentioned climate, cyber, ESG, and the emergence of secondary perils. Every day, we read about wildfires, convective storms, floods throughout the world. Our clients are asking us to build tools to help and manage through that volatility and understand how they manage their businesses moving forward.
John Doyle: Thanks, Dean.
Jimmy Bhullar: And just as a follow up, thereâs been a lot of concern in the market about Oliver Wyman and the consulting business with an economic flow down. Obviously youâre not showing that in your results. But whatâs driving the momentum there and whatâs your outlook for the business as the economy does in fact slow down a little bit?
Dan Glaser: Yes. And so, we talked to you over many years about how Oliver Wyman over long stretches of time tends to be our fastest growing segment. And weâve been dramatically pleased. I mean, thereâs nothing that I could say negatively right now about Oliver Wyman posting a 16 on top of a 28 in the year before on the top line. But Nick, how do you see things?
Nick Studer: Yes, I mean, I think sort of broad growth and robust pipeline. We are prepared in terms of our client offerings. Itâs important that when the cycle changes and the questions change, we are prepared with answers for those new questions. And so weâve been preparing those offerings for quite a few years now. Iâd also say that the pandemic created very different market conditions in each of the sectors we serve. So some of our client segments have been having a very tough time for quite a long time and others have been booming. But overall, weâve see no slow down in the pipeline to-date.
Dan Glaser: Sure. And Martine, you want to talk about what youâre seeing in Mercer generally and Mercer career specifically?
Martine Ferland: Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Dan and Jimmy, for the question. In a very similar fashion, we see pipeline being strong in the career business, career services in particular. And as Nick just mentioned, the pandemic had instigated and accelerated so much change around the way that we work. We see the labor shortages. So we currently donât see any slowdown or any evidence of it. We certainly are cautious in looking at the red flags where â when and where they will pop up, but there is these conditions in the market right now, different questions as Nick was saying that our expertise can help clients answer.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question on line comes from Mr. David Motemaden from Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Dan, you mentioned youâre prepared to act as economic conditions warrant. Could you maybe just elaborate a bit on some of these actions and how far away you are from putting some of those in place? What sort of youâre looking for in the environment before you start to take some of these actions?
Dan Glaser: Yes, I mean, ultimately, thereâs several things that we are working on, I would say in over both throughout short-term, midterm and long-term as a way to become a more efficient organization and that touches upon technology modernization, real estate rationalization, different ways of working for our colleagues. Looking at a number of factors on operational excellence, I mean, I think in general, weâre still in the early to mid stages of being able to create operational improvements within the firm, which deliver higher levels of client service at lower levels of internal cost. And thatâs something that weâre certainly very focused on. One of the things that weâre looking at as well is you donât want to get too cautious, too early. Our business is doing significantly well. Weâve been investing throughout both through the pandemic in â as well as in 2021. And we continue to invest today. Weâre still in a hiring mode. Although, the hiring pace is more similar to 2019 than it would have been in 2021, where we had a real surge in strategic hiring, most of our costs are pretty identifiable. You have compensation and benefits. Youâve got technology, you have premises or real estate, and you have T&E. So the levers that you can utilize are available. And I have to say, we have a very large variable compensation pool driven by profitability. And so, it is dramatically larger than it was a decade ago or five years ago because our profitability is dramatically larger. And that gives us tremendous flexibility of protecting shareholders in the event that that we hit some headwinds on growth or macroeconomic factors. So you never want to be tangling about macroenvironment and weâre not. But on the other hand, I donât think thereâs a more resilient organization that you could actually invest in.
David Motemaden: Got it. No that...
Dan Glaser: Do you have any follow-up?
David Motemaden: That makes sense. Thanks for that. And then I guess just â I guess sort of an expense related question, but more focused on the margins. So, the first half was supposed to be tougher comps, I think we just got out of the first half pretty good expansion, 20 basis points of expansion in the first half of 2022. Should we expect a tick up in that as we sort of get into the back half because some of these tougher comps are no longer as tough from an expense standpoint? Or were there any â was there anything sort of one-off in the expense flow this quarter or in the first quarter that might mean that thereâs a little bit shifted to the back half of the year?
Dan Glaser: Yes. I mean, to be clear, we are super pleased with our modest margin expansion year to date. I mean, come on, we hired 6,000 people on a net basis last year and weâve been able to grow our business and deliver some modest margin expansion. And all the growth benefit or I shouldnât say all, most of the growth benefit is in our future as opposed to in our past. So, if we look at the back half of the third quarter, the headwind on comp have been expensed from all of the hiring begins to abate. And so, thereâll be â and the growth benefit will continue. And so we donât give margin guidance by quarter. But we give it by year and weâre saying our margins are going to go up this year. Weâre going to have strong EPS in 2022. And so we feel good about where we are on margins. We donât run the business obsessing about margins, frankly, we run the business looking at growing our top line and growing our profitability and margins are an outcome of growing our revenue faster than growing our expense. But our â the back half of the year will play out and weâll deliver a strong year. We think itâll be a very good year. Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question online comes from Weston Bloomer from UBS.
Weston Bloomer: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is on your free cash flow growth. Growth is okay in the 2Q, but one half has been a little bit lower, looks like mostly to higher crude comp. My question is how should we think about free cash flow growth in the second half of the year? And are there any notable headwinds or tailwinds to point out?
Dan Glaser: Sure. Mark, why donât you take that?
Mark McGivney: Sure. As we consistently say, we try not to focus too much on free cash flow growth in a particular quarter, even over the course of a particular year, because it can be a lot of volatility. But when we look back over a long stretch of time going back a decade or more, weâve delivered double digit growth in free cash flow and our outlook for free cash flow growth is that will continue to deliver strong free cash flow growth. You pointed out the comparison challenge. The early part of the year is our seasonal low for cash generation because of our variable comp payouts. And the first half of this year has a tough comparable. Our variable comp pools were up substantially last year based on our significant good performance. And so you have that tough comp against the low base and thatâs been the drag early in the year. As you pointed out and not that I want to focus on cash flow in a particular quarter, but in the second quarter we were up 8%. But I think the bottom line is our outlook for cash generation remains strong.
Dan Glaser: Thanks. Do you have a follow up?
Weston Bloomer: I do. Yes. My second question is itâs on your capital allocation throughout the year. I guess, how much of the second quarter allocation for higher repurchases was maybe due to a lower share price or less opportunities or richer multiples in M&A? I was hoping you could kind of expand on the M&A environment where youâre seeing from multiple perspective and where you could see opportunities? And kind of how we should think about repurchases versus M&A in the second half? Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Sure. Well, clearly multiples have gone up over the last few years. And certainly when you look at longer stretches of time, theyâve gone up materially. And so we have to be more diligent in deciding as we go through pro forma statements of private companies, whatâs really real and what will remain and how we think about the business. Our pipeline is pretty good. When we â what we announce with regard to Westpac in Australia though, has cash out the door next year, not this year, even though that is a commitment that that weâve made in terms of acquiring a business. So our pipeline remains strong, but we have no budget with regard to acquisitions. Acquisitions are a core part of our competency and what we do as a firm. And youâre very right to focus on share repurchase as being a somehow a dual â a duo with acquisitions. If we have a year thatâs particularly light on acquisitions, then we would have a stronger year of share repurchase. We favor share repurchases over building cash on the balance sheet. So you look at our dividend, which went up by 10%, thatâs the first call. Then we look at acquisitions, but we donât have a budget on acquisition, and we donât press on acquisitions. They occur when they occur. Then share repurchase goes in front of building cash on the balance sheet. And so, yes, so far, first half of this year has favored share repurchase. Doesnât mean the second half will. Weâll just have to see how it plays out.
Weston Bloomer: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Dan Glaser: Next question please. Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Katie Sakys from Autonomous Research.
Katie Sakys: Hi there. Thank you so much for taking my question. This is Katie on for Ryan Tunis at Autonomous. I had a question about your guidance on foreign currency headwinds, which seems rather moderate despite foreign currency moves. Could you give us some further color on your confidence in the modest EPS impact youâve guided to particularly in the third quarter? Is it a matter of the timing of the recognition of international revenue or mix or perhaps just Marshâs recognition of international revenues in USC versus local currencies?
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Katie. Mark, why donât you take that?
Mark McGivney: Yes, sure. And when you look at our guidance over the course of the full year, so $0.07 in the first half, and then $0.06 across the back half, theyâre pretty meaningful impact when you look back over the last several. And actually tracks pretty well with our 10-K disclosure of 10% move in the dollar against major currencies what that means. For the third quarter though, and weâve talked about this in the past, there is a modest impact and that is what we are modelling, assuming that rates stay where they are today. Really what you see in the third quarter is because of dollar placement activity in London a weak pound actually act as a bit of a hedge against a strong dollar relative to the other currencies. And that pound impact that natural hedge impact, if you will is most significant in this coming third quarter. And so what you see is a benefit from the weak pound offsetting some of the other currencies. But as we get to the fourth quarter, thatâs when that benefit as strong and then we see that $0.05 in the fourth quarter.
Katie Sakys: Got it. Thank you. And as a quick follow up, are you expecting any margin tailwinds from foreign currency in the back half of the year?
Dan Glaser: Mark, do you want to talk about that at all?
Mark McGivney: Yes. Generally not significantly, most of our margin is going to be driven by our operating performance.
Dan Glaser: Thanks.
Operator: Iâd now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan for any closing remarks.
Dan Glaser: Terrific. And Iâd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning. I want to thank our 83 colleagues for their commitment, hard work and dedication to Marsh McLennan. Look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Goodbye.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes todayâs conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-21 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh McLennan’s Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. First quarter 2022 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company’s website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today’s earnings release. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.
Dan Glaser: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is John Doyle, our Group President and COO; Mark McGivney, our CFO, and the CEOs of our businesses: Martin South of Marsh, Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter, Martine Ferland of Mercer, and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh McLennan started 2022 strong, and we are well-positioned for another good year. Our top line momentum continued. We generated the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying growth and the highest first quarter underlying growth in over two decades, with each of our businesses showing strength. Our adjusted operating income grew 12%. This comes despite a tough comparable of 20% growth in the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted EPS growth was 16%, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And we saw modest margin expansion despite the substantial investments we made in organic hiring last year. Overall, a strong start to the year. At Marsh McLennan, advancing good in the world is important to us. In our view, great company have to not only do well and deliver for investors, but also do good and make a broader contribution to society. We believe in order to deliver long-term value for shareholders, we also have to be a good employer, a good global citizen, and bring our best to our clients. We are proud of our track record on ESG and recently released our second Environmental, Social and Governance report. Our report highlights the many ways in which we are confronting the most complex ESG challenges of our time, both within our own company and on behalf of clients. We made progress on several ESG initiatives. For example, we are committed to energy transition and achieve the carbon neutral certification in 2021. We also declared a new goal of being net-zero by 2050, with a target of reducing carbon emissions 50% by 2030. We are committed to inclusion and diversity. We launched our inclusion and diversity center of excellence and enhanced our D&I disclosure in the areas of pay equity, workforce representation and talent flows. And we added Gaye Erkan to our Board of Directors, furthering our commitment to increased gender diversity on our Board. We are also working across our businesses to help clients address the broad spectrum of complex ESG issues, such as climate change, diversity and inclusion, affordable healthcare, cybersecurity, and sustainable investing, among others. I want to highlight several recent examples of how we are developing ESG solutions for clients. Marsh launched the new directors and officers liability insurance initiative that recognize -- recognizes U.S. based clients with superior ESG frameworks. Guy Carpenter arranged FloodSmart Re catastrophe bonds for FEMA to secure capital markets based flood reinsurance coverage for its NFIP program. These bonds help FEMA pay for NFIP claims when disaster strikes. Mercer continues to be a leader in helping firms quantify and address pay equity, as well as diversity and inclusion challenges. As an example, our recently released stepping up for equity study provides insights on closing the opportunity gap for Black Americans. Oliver Wyman helped clients pursue commercially viable climate transitions, working with CDP, the World Economic Forum, the United Nations, and others to set agendas and build consensus on the issue of climate change. We are also helping clients develop low-carbon business models and manage risks associated with the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. As we do our part to accelerate this transition, we recognize that a secure energy supply is crucial for the global economy and society as a whole. This is especially true in the context of today's geopolitical environment. We believe all communities are best served by working with both operators of clean energy assets and traditional energy companies to make the transition as quickly and smooth as possible. The work we are doing across all of these ESG related areas has a direct impact on the communities where we live and operate. We are making a difference through disaster mitigation and recovery, promoting healthy societies, and diversity and inclusion. Overall, ESG continues to be an area where we see both significant growth potential, and an opportunity to benefit our clients, colleagues, and communities. I'd like to take a moment to comment on the war in Ukraine. We strongly condemn the Russian government invasion of Ukraine and are horrified by the tragic human toll this war is taking. On March 10th, we announced the decision to exit our business in Russia. In a minute, John will provide more detail on steps we've taken to support colleagues and serve our clients during this crisis. Turning to current economic conditions and the outlook for the rest of 2022. We see a picture with greater risks and uncertainties than when we enter the year. That said, we continue to see an environment that is supportive of growth. Based on our current outlook, we continue to expect mid single digit or better underlying revenue growth for the full year. We also expect solid growth in adjusted EPS and to extend our track record of annual margin expansion. Macro challenges like supply chain per pressures, energy market and commodity dislocations, rising cybersecurity concerns, and future of work, create demand for our services and opportunities to help clients. We also believe that over the long-term demand for our solutions will remain strong, given rising levels of complexity, volatility, and uncertainty across the business landscape. With that, let me turn it over to John for his comments on the quarter.
John Doyle: Thanks Dan and good morning everyone. Our first quarter results were strong. We had double-digit underlying revenue growth with all businesses positively contributing, and our adjusted operating in income hit a record level in the first quarter. Our strong star positions as well for 2022, despite greater uncertainty about the macroeconomic outlook. Before I discuss market trends and our performance, I want to comment on our response to the crisis in Ukraine. As Dan noted, we condemned the Russian aggression and we are saddened by the human suffering the war in Ukraine has caused. Our primary concern is the wellbeing of colleagues affected by this crisis. We took a number of steps to assist them, including providing evacuation support for Ukrainian colleagues and creating assistance programs in Poland and Ukraine. In addition, we've established a humanitarian relief fund to help the Ukrainian people.  We're also bringing our capabilities and risk strategy and people to support clients as they grapple with the challenges of this conflict and its wider economic effects. Oliver Wyman is helping clients in the public and private sectors manage a wide scope of issues. We are working on government security in defense matters, helping a number of banks manage their exposure to the region, supporting energy clients with their supply chain considerations and assisting large manufacturers as they manage the risk of production shutdowns. Marsh is advising clients on risks around aircraft nationalization, cybersecurity, physical assets, supply chain, and transitioning away from Russian energy. Mercer is helping clients deal with capital market volatility, asset allocation and Russian exposures. We're also working to provide continued health coverage for Ukrainians leaving the country. Guy Carpenter is helping clients understand their exposures, portfolio concentrations and reinsurance recoveries. We're also advising clients on the complexities around sanctions and cause of loss, number of occurrences and claims aggregation. I'm extremely proud of how our firm has responded to this crisis. Overall, we are harnessing the power of Marsh McLennan to help our colleagues and our clients in this moment that matters. Now, let me provide an update on current P&C insurance market conditions. Rate increases in the marketplace continue to persist, reflecting losses and concerns about the impact of inflation on claims and the firm reinsurance market. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 11% year-over-year. This marks the 18th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace. Looking at pricing by line. The Marsh Market Index showed global property insurance was up 7% and global casualty rates were up mid single digits on average. Global financial and professional lines, excluding cyber, increased high single digits, while cyber rates more than doubled in some geographies. As a reminder, our index skews the large account business, however, small and middle market insurance rates continue to arise as well, although less than for large complex accounts. Turning to reinsurance April 1 renewals largely reflected a continuation of the January 1 pricing environment. The industry remains well capitalized, but finding capacity is challenging in specific segments. This reflects ongoing and emerging issues such as the frequency of severe events, cyber, climate change, and core and social inflation. Overall, at April 1, U.S. property catastrophe rates were up in the high single digits for non-loss impacted accounts. While loss impacted accounts generally increased in a range of 10% to 30%. U.S. cyber rates were up mid teens or higher depending on loss activity. Japanese property catastrophe rates increased low single digits. We remain focused on helping clients navigate challenging insurance and reinsurance markets, and the evolving risk environment. Turning to our performance in the quarter. As I noted earlier, Marsh McLennan had strong results. In the first quarter, we had double-digit underlying revenue growth in both RIS and consulting. Adjusted operating income grew 12% on top of 20% in the first quarter of 2021, a terrific result. The first quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying revenue growth, a longest stretch in over two decades. Looking at risk and insurance services. First quarter revenue was $3.5 billion, up 10% compared with a year ago or 11% on an underlying basis. This is the third quarter in the last 12 months risk and insurance grew 10% or better, the best trend since 2003. Adjusted operating income increased 12% to $1.2 billion, while our adjusted operating margin declined 10 basis points to 36.5% reflecting investments in the business. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.5 billion, up 10% compared with a year ago. Revenue growth was 11% on an underlying basis. We had excellent renewal growth and we continue to see strong new business. U.S. and Canada had 10% underlying revenue growth. This marks the U.S. and Canada's fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying revenue growth. International was also strong with underlying revenue growth of 11%. Asia-Pacific was up 17%. LATIN America grew 16% and EMEA was up 9%. Guy Carpenter's first quarter revenue was $1 billion up 11% on an underlying basis, driven by strong growth in new business and exceptional retention. Guy Carpenter has now achieved underlying revenue growth of over 10% three of the last four quarters. In the Consulting segment, revenue of $2 billion was a first quarter record, up 7% from a year ago or 10% on an underlying basis. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of 10% or higher growth. Adjusted operating increased 9% to a first quarter record of $402 million. The adjusted operating margin was 20.6%, up 10 basis points versus a year ago. Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 6% on an underlying basis, the fourth consecutive quarter of 6% or higher growth. Career grew 16% on an underlying basis. We continue to see robust demand for solutions linked to new ways of working, skills gaps, workforce transformation, and D&I issues like pay equity. Health underlying revenue growth was strong at 9% in the quarter, reflecting growth across all geographies. This quarter's results benefited from strong demand for our services, higher retention, rising employment and medical inflation. Wealth increased 2% on an underlying basis, reflecting modest growth in both investment management and defined benefits. Our assets under management were $388 billion at the end of the first quarter, down 7% sequentially as net inflows were more than offset by capital market declines. However, compared to the first quarter last year, AUM was up 2%. Oliver Wyman's momentum continued despite starting to lap tougher comparables to an outstanding 2021. Revenue in the first quarter was $667 million, an increase of 17% on an underlying basis. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and reflects continued strong demand across all geographies. Overall, I'm pleased with our excellent first quarter performance and it sets us up for a good year. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark for further detail on our financial results and a discussion of our outlook for the rest of 2022.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, John and good morning. As Dan, John mentioned our financial performance in the first quarter marked a strong start to the year. We saw another great quarter of double-digit underlying revenue growth, meaningful earnings growth, despite tough expense comparison. We generated GAAP EPS of $2.10 in the quarter and adjusted EPS of $2.30 up 16% from a year ago. Operating income was $1.4 billion. And adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, a first quarter record. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points in the first quarter to 29.7%, despite the impact of the significant organic investments we made last year. We remain excited about the benefits we expect from these investments, but they come with upfront costs we continue to absorb in the short term. The first quarter was also active -- an active quarter for capital management. We completed the highest quarterly level of share purchases since the third quarter of 2015. The pace of acquisition activity continues, with the recent announcement of our acquisition of Booz Allen Hamilton's MENA practice. And we announced an additional $5 billion share purchase authorization. John covered our business operating results. So, I'll cover some of the other aspects of our performance and outlook. Adjusted corporate expense was $60 million in the first quarter. Foreign exchange was a headwind of $0.04 to our adjusted EPS. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a modest headwind in the second quarter. Our other net benefit credit was $62 million in a quarter. For the full year 2022, we expect our other net benefit credit will be about $250 million. Investment income was $26 million in the first quarter on a GAAP basis or $17 million on an adjusted basis, and mainly reflects gains in our private equity portfolio. Interest expense in the first quarter was $110 million compared to $118 million in the first quarter of 2021, reflecting lower long-term debt balances. Based on our current forecast, we expect a similar level of interest expense in the second quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter was 23.1% compared with 24.3% in the first quarter of last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discreet items, the largest of which was the accounting for share based compensation similar to a year ago. Excluding discreet items are effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume an adjusted effective tax rate of around 25% for 2022. In the first quarter, we recorded a $52 million charge, which is mostly non-cash relating to our exit from Russia. This has been treated as a noteworthy item and excluded from adjusted results. We reached an agreement to transfer ownership of our Russian business to local management who will operate independently in the Russian market. This situation resulted in the deconsolidation of our business and an associated write-down of our carrying value. In terms of ongoing impact, revenues and operating income from Russia are not significant. Turning to capital management. Now balance sheet. We entered the quarter with total debt of $11.7 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity isn't until March of 2023. In the first quarter, we repurchase 3.2 million shares of our stock for $500 million, reflecting our strong financial position and outlook for cash generation. We continue to expect to deploy approximately the $4 billion of capital in 2022 across dividends, acquisitions and share purchases. The ultimate level of share purchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develop. As we've consistently said, we favor attractive acquisitions over share purchases, as we view high quality acquisitions as the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long-term. However, we also recognize that returning capital to shareholders generates meaningful returns for investors over time. And each year, we target raising our dividend and reducing our share count. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $772 million. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $813 million and included $272 million for dividends, $41 million for acquisitions and $500 million for share repurchases. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we see continued strong demand for our advice and solutions, even though we start to lap tougher growth comparisons in the second quarter. The investments we made in hiring last year will continue to be a headwind to expense in the first half, but as we get further into the third quarter, this becomes less of a drag. Also, we recognize there is a higher level of uncertainty and outlooks caused by the war in Ukraine and its potential impact on the global economy. Overall, our strong start leaves us well positioned for another good year in 2022. For the full year, we continue to expect to deliver mid single digit or higher underlying growth, solid growth in adjusted EPS and margin expansion. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call back to Dan.
Dan Glaser: Thanks Mark. And operator, we're ready to go to Q&A.
Operator: Certainly.  Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the organic growth, another double-digit growth quarter. So, it sounds like you guys are still expecting that the revenue benefit from the hires that you guys did last year is more something that we should think about coming in the future. Can you give us a sense if there was any benefit from those hires that positively impacted the Q1, and how we should think about the rest of the year? Or is this still more a benefit you expect in 2023 and beyond?
Dan Glaser: Sure. Sure, Elyse and good morning. I'll take it to begin with and then I'll hand off to John to add some detail to it. There's many factors which are underpinning our growth. We are in fundamental growth markets. You look at the areas of risk, strategy and people, the demand is all on the rise, and we are the most strategically positioned company in the world as an adviser in those areas. So, I think that broadly, and fundamentally, we've got some competitive advantages, which are assisting growth and will continue to do so. The hiring strategy of last year has given us a mild benefit thus far, in particular on Guy Carpenter. But John, why don't you go into that in a little bit more detail?
John Doyle: Sure, Dan. Elyse, as I noted earlier, we're very pleased with our start to the year. Growth was strong pretty much across the board and I think you're referring to strat hires in RIS. But I want to note the growth in consulting was quite strong in the quarter as well as we're seeing good demand for our services across the board. We're pleased with the start in terms of the strat hire impact. As Dan noted, the impact was a little bit more notable in Guy Carpenter at this point. But it will take some time for them to become really fully accretive to our revenue expectations. It's a two to three-year period. So, our focus is on onboarding them as successfully as possible, but so far so good. The quarter really creates some good momentum for us. Obviously, there's a macroeconomic uncertainty given the war, given rising rates, supply chain issues, inflation, although I'd note inflation is generally a good thing for us on capital markets volatility, but we're well-positioned. As I said earlier, there's strong demand for our services, and we expect a good strong year of growth.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my follow-up on, within RIS, if I look at the other operating expenses on an adjusted basis, they look to be flat to down modestly versus last Q1, which represented a pretty tough comp. So, any color on the drivers of that, given that I would think T&E should have been higher there? And how should we think about the outlook for the other Op expenses over the balance of the year?
Dan Glaser: Sure. I mean, similar to last year, the growth of expense was virtually all related to compensation and benefits. And so, we continue to manage our expenses as we've always done. And when we look at the start of this year, yeah, things like T&E are a bit higher than what they were and we would hope that, that would continue, because it would point to more of a return to a normal operating environment. However, our searches for efficiency never ends. Our goal -- and I think I've said it on previous calls in the past, I mean, a healthy comp and ben as a percentage of revenue is a good thing for our business, for a people business. But continued focus on reducing all other operating expenses, particularly as we grow the firm bigger and bigger and use our -- some of our scale advantages to get some economies is something that's a core of how we operate the firm. So, I don't think you're going to see a lot of growth in the all other expense category. In fact, over time, you'll see reductions there. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Bhullar with JP Morgan.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. You spoke about this a little bit in your comments as well. But can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of just pricing in both the commercial market and in reinsurance. And it seems like the prices are still up, but the pace is slowing down. And what sort of pushback are you getting, if any, from your clients on the study increases? And what are some of the things that they're doing whether increasing retention or otherwise?
Dan Glaser: It's a good question. John, do you want to take that?
John Doyle: Sure. Jimmy, as I noted in my prepared remarks, the insurance and reinsurance markets remain pretty challenging for our clients. Having said that, rate increases are decelerating and in at least most insurance markets around the world. Cyber, of course, is the most notable exception. For us, though, there is a mitigating impact of that rate deceleration around inflation and values. But let me ask Martin and Dean to comment a bit. Martin, maybe you could start, offer a bit more color on what's happening in the insurance market?
Martin South: Sure. Thank you, John. Well, as you noted, it's the 18th consecutive quarter of rate increases. So, clients are weary, that's the concern. But they decelerated as I noted in the -- the last call we had, they came down by two points in last quarter, another two points this quarter to -- land at 11%. Geographically, still as I noted last time, there's one outlier, which is Latin America, where they saw modest rate increases, but have been flatter during the rest of the cycle. By product across the board growth, casualty still strong at 4%, property up 7%. FinPro lines, which includes cyber, 26%. If you're stripping that out, that comes down and we're still seeing double-digit and doubling of rates in cyber, over 110% in the U.S. And the U.K. rates up 100%. So, there's a lot more concerned about that, but otherwise, as noted a mild deceleration.
John Doyle: Thanks, Martin. Dean?
Dean Klisura: Thank you, John. As John mentioned earlier, the April 1 renewal reflected a continuation of the January 1 pricing environment. But there's challenges in the reinsurance market in certain segments that are driving pricing up. Examples of that would be the property catastrophe market where aggregate capacity continues to be constrained in the trading environment. Parts of the cyber market, including aggregate capacity for excess of loss contracts is currently a challenge and we're seeing double-digit pricing in the cyber market. And then, I would refer to segments of the London specialty market that are really being impacted by the Russia/Ukraine war, including more terrorism, political violence, aviation and marine coverages, we're experiencing very challenging renewals for excess of loss contracts. And then certainly retrocession capacity, again, as capital has flowed out of the ILS market in Bermuda and London, aggregate capacity for retrocession coverage continues to be very expensive and a challenge for our clients.
John Doyle: Thanks Dean. Just one quick last point, Jimmy. We continue to invest heavily in data and analytics, really help our clients navigate the market and make the trade-offs ever for them. So, it's a client-by-client outcome ultimately.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And if I could just ask one more on Russia. Is the -- the Russia directly, obviously, is a very small part of your business, Ukraine as well. But the full impact of the conflict in terms of any sort of collateral impacts or something, is that fully reflected in your results? Or is there something that would be a lag in future periods, because it sometimes takes clients time to react? And like, should we expect anything noticeable in 2Q from Russia?
Dan Glaser: Yeah. There's no inherent buildup issues that we're aware of, but there are implications to this war -- this war in Ukraine that are yet to play out. And so, we don't know what those are. What's the impact on energy prices? What's the impact on GDP globally, in particular, in Europe? Is there a continuation of taking size, which creates more division in the world? And what's the impact on that basis in terms of the last 20 years globalization developments? And so, there's a lot of factors, Jimmy. And that's part of the uncertainty that we've all talked about. We're doing very well. In some ways, we thrive in periods of uncertainty and volatility, because our clients want to talk issues through and we're a company that they turn to on some of these issues. But in terms of headwinds that it could conceivably create, I think, it's going to play out for quite a while now. We'll just have to see how it goes. But we've demonstrated in many different periods of time, whether it's a global financial crisis, COVID, et cetera, that we are an extremely resilient organization.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Next question, please. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning everybody. My first question, I guess, maybe continuing your last comment, Dan. Clearly, you have a very strong track record of posting expenses that are lower than revenues. But with the significant hires you had last year, if we do head into a recession this year, do you think that you can still achieve margin expansion?
Dan Glaser: We're going to have margin expansion this year. And it will be our 15th year -- consecutive years of margin expansion. We run our business where every year our revenue growth will exceed our expense growth. And it's not every quarter, but it's most quarters and it's certainly every year. It's the way we approach the business. And we have a tremendous capability of managing that expense base in both good times and tough times. Some ways, managing your expense base in tough times is easier than managing your expense base in good times where everybody wants to do need in different things. So -- but ultimately, we're comfortable that we've got growth momentum, and that will continue based upon the industries that we serve.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. And my second question is with the Fed hiking rates now, fiduciary income, I'm assuming it's going to move up. Do you expect to have that flow all to the bottom line? Or do you have some maybe additional investments that you'd see taking action on or taking advantage of the higher margin coming from fiduciary income?
Dan Glaser: No. It's a good question. So, Mark, do you want to take that?
Mark McGivney: Yeah. Yaron, good morning. That fiduciary interest income is certainly a source of upside for us and exactly how much and when -- when we see the benefit all depends on and when rates move. But the vast majority of that would just flow right through to the bottom line. In 2019, we had $105 million of interest income. Last year, it was $15 million and we've overcome that. These days, we're averaging about $10 million of fiduciary assets. So, if rates move across the world where our balances are, by 100 basis points, that's $100 million of upside.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on that if I can. Do clients push for -- pushback against the increases when fiduciary income is rising? Or are those being significantly separate?
Dan Glaser: No. It's a good question. And I've been in the business for 40 years. Clients don't want to get involved in the paying the 27 underwriters who are on their account and some of those things are semiannual payments and some are even monthly or quarterly. It is an administrative complexity that clients have no interest in being part of. We take our fiduciary responsibilities very seriously. So, it's not like we can invest long on fiduciary assets. So, it's all the short end of the curve. But we would anticipate no pushback on getting some income -- some fiduciary income because the fact of the matter is, for a number of years, this has only been a one-way traffic in the direction of down. And so, there's been many years where we've done an awful lot of work around billings and payments in which there was very little or no compensation related to it. So, we're looking at this as a potentially large upside to us.
Meyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. Second question. I was hoping you could frame, I guess, clients' willingness to spend on ESG? How has that been developing? And is there any difference based on client size?
Dan Glaser: Yeah. No. It's a very good question. And in some ways, the addressable market for ESG has not yet been determined. It's going to go wide. It's getting larger every year. And fundamentally, I think that every company from private or public midsize or larger is going out to demonstrate that they're a good company. And they demonstrate that in a multitude of different ways, but to -- with tight labor markets, that's the kind of company that people want to work for. Clients want to be associated with companies who are doing good work in the world. But I think it's an interesting question. I'd like to go around the horn a little bit and John can talk about it. And then maybe Martine and Nick can address it a little bit, because they're seeing a lot of ESG benefit in their results. But John?
John Doyle: Sure, Dan. Meyer, we're quite excited about our role here and the ability to impact clients and their future. And it's contributing positively to our growth now, but we're in the very early stages of what's possible here across all the businesses. Dan added some of the work that we're doing in his prepared remarks. But again, we're developing new solutions, new products and working with our clients every single day. We're part of the sustainable markets initiative overall as a company. So, we're excited about that. Nick, maybe I'll ask you to comment first. You're doing a lot of work, particularly around climate, around broader issues as well.
Nick Studer: Yeah. John, thank you. Thank you, Meyer for the question. The  has been working, a great deal with companies across sectors to help plan for a smart climate transition along the lines that Dan described in his prepared comments. As you know, we largely work with the larger company, so I can't talk to the segmentation part of your question. But whether it's in financial services, supporting backhaul industry as they move to support their clients, or whether it's with some of the hard-to-abate sectors like steel, like some of the transportation sectors. We see an enormous amount of work on our climate and sustainability cracks more than doubled last year. It's as big as some of our significant industry practices already.
John Doyle: Martine, maybe you could comment? Obviously, we see big demand in career services, but are also doing a lot of work in investments.
Martine Ferland: No. Absolutely John, and thanks for the question Meyer. We've been pioneering in ESG for many, many years now. First and foremost, the transition to the low-carbon economy. So, the investors or clients who work with us in managing their assets, they want to understand the transition to a lower net-zero emission economy and also the impact of, for example, the  they're making and their exposure to Russia, which falls under for them, their ESG policies. So, we're helping them, look at this and the consequences on oil supply, the energy strategy, et cetera. So, there's high demand for research, for advice, for modeling of the risk that are associated with that and the rewards of various investment strategies. And as you mentioned, John, of course, in the diversity, equity and inclusion domain, that's another place where we've been very active. We have many studies that help clients bridge the gender gap or the race and ethnicity gap. We do workforce analytics, we do pay equity. We have clients that build diverse workforces. And that's been such a tough of mine agenda item for our clients in the last couple of years. We just issued, as we said in the opening remarks, a stepping up for equity study where we work with 50 clients to identify the techniques, the strategies that you can employ for employers to really help close the gap on opportunities for Black Americans. And there's a G in the ESG, and that's also been always on our agenda. When you think about the work we do for executive compensation, DB and DC, the pension fund governance advice, our OCIO business is very much depend on different governance model that gives agility and integrity to the investment. So, that's really top of mind of our clients and its business that's been growing really fast over the last few years.
John Doyle: Thank you, Martine. What's happening at Marsh?
Nick Studer: Thank you, John. As exciting things going on in Marsh, we feel that a resilience index to have start  to see their progress on that business. We're testing hypotheses on clients about how a positive score can impact on their loss cost going forward in an initial study on D&O rates as mentioned in your remarks. It's showing that claims can be dispensed earlier and a lower outcome as companies seem to be doing good. We're testing that hypothesis in other areas of the business, other casualty lines that offset social inflation. And property as well where companies are investing heavily in social, in pollution protection and so forth, will make an impact there. We feel that we're going to back that up with the data strategy that we have and make a positive for our clients as they look ahead, and it's a good work for us too.
John Doyle: Terrific. Thank you. Dean, one last one?
Dean Klisura: Thanks John. Obviously, climate change is a top priority for Guy Carpenter's clients and we're working very closely with them to support them in these efforts. Obviously, helping them understand physical risk to climate change across their portfolios, across the world, and we're doing a lot of modeling and analytics work there to help them support there. We're inviting them on regulatory requests that come in, that want us access climate. We do credit rating advisory. Lots of the questions about the impact on climate change. And last, John, I would mention structuring transitional reinsurance solutions to help kind of mitigate that exposure for our clients.
John Doyle: Thanks Dean.
Dan Glaser: Thanks. So, you can see, Meyer, we're all over the ESG space and expect it to underpin our growth in future years. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to clarify a comment on the reductions in other G&A expenses over time. I guess, was that a comment for this year? Or is that over a medium term timeframe? And also just want to get a sense for what's driving that. Because I know in the past, Dan, you've spoken about the operational excellence program, which might be contributing. But I'm also wondering, are there any sort of other sort of like real estate optimization or any other cost save programs that you're implementing as a result of some of the changes that have been put in place due to COVID-19, and what that means for the workplace? Is that also a driver that's coming through in that comment as well?
Dan Glaser: Yeah. It absolutely is, David. Ultimately, the way we run our business is -- one of the operative words that we use is more. We want to get better every year. We want to provide our clients with more capabilities with less internal costs. And so, our search for efficiency is a core part of this executive team's job and something that we're very focused on. And whether it's real estate, more purposeful travel and tech modernization, operational efficiency gains, the fact that we've got several new faces around the table and new faces come up with good ideas and fresh ideas. And there's lots of ways of running the business. And our goal over time is supporting our clients with a combination of really good comp and ben, because that makes us a strong company and helps us be an employer of choice in the industries that we operate. But always relentlessly going after all other expenses that have just fundamental aspects of running a multinational. So, this is a midterm and a long-term downward trend in our expense base in all other expenses. Next question -- or you have a follow-up, David?
David Motemaden: Yeah. I do have a follow-up. That's helpful, Dan. I appreciate that. And you mentioned a lot of new faces around the table, which is obviously -- you guys have been prolific in hiring. I guess, I look at that $30 million of legal claims that you guys have incurred this quarter. I think it's around $90 million over the last five quarters. Is there a way to approximate how much revenues are coming with those just from some of the teams that you guys have hired? Is it $50 million? Is it $90 million? Is there just like a rule of thumb that we can think about for the potential revenue impact over the next few years as those people are onboarded?
Dan Glaser: Yeah. I mean, I think, the way to look at it is, our revenue over the next several years should benefit from the organic hiring that we did last year. I mean, you look at it on the basis of -- last year, we had an opportunity to make significant organic investments in building our business. And it's something that we always focus on delivering good results today, but always focusing on the future and how we can build a better company. And this is an opportunity that John and I haven't seen in our careers in terms of being able to build the business on an organic basis. And so, we had the opportunity and we had the means, and last year's strong levels of organic growth helped provide those means and meant that we could still deliver good results to investors last year, while we were making these strong organic investments. You have to know that we all know around the table that organic investments are always short-term dilutive, and it's harder to do in some ways and acquisitions just by the P&L map, but we made the right decision and press forward. The vast majority of that expense is comp and ben. And the way I would look at it is we've got another two or three quarters and then the expense growth is going to be in the rearview mirror, but the capability and the growth kicker will remain. And so, this is a huge benefit to the overall organization. We're not going to quantify whether Henry and Sally are delivering today. I mean, we're a big organization. We've added to our market leading capabilities. We like where we are positioned right now in terms of the performance of some of that strategic hiring, and this is going to be a best with for us in coming years as well as this year.
David Motemaden: Understood. Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Sure. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith: Yeah. Thanks. A couple of quick questions here. First, maybe Mark, free cash flow this quarter was pretty weak and it looked like there was a lot of paid compensation. How much of that was called one-time in nature just from all the hires that you had last year? And kind of how do I think about free cash flow here going forward?
Mark McGivney: Sure. Good morning, Brian. So, I'd start by saying, if you look back over a long stretch of time, our track record on free cash flow growth has been terrific. With the last decade, we've generated double-digit free cash flow growth. And you expect that given our strong earnings and our outlook is -- for continued strong earnings growth and continued strong free cash flow growth. If you look back over that last decade though, you'd see a lot of volatility and you see that volatility just in the last couple of years. So, we generally would stay away from talking about predicting free cash flow in a given year, although we expect strong cash generation this year. Now as you pointed out, first quarters typically are low for cash generation, because we do pay out the majority of our variable comp in the first quarter. And the reduction this year was because our variable comp payouts were up. And that was mostly a function of the strong performance we had last year, both on new business growth and sales related plans as well as just the overall growth in earnings and the bonus plans that accrue from that.
Brian Meredith: Great. And then my next question, just curious perhaps you could talk a little bit about what the M&A kind of environment landscape looks like right now, given all of the uncertainties right now with respect to what economic growth could look like over the next 12 months and I wonder if you could comment on that.
Dan Glaser: Sure. I'll start and then I'll hand to John. M&A is a big part of our organization and not just for the last decade, but literally since its inception. We don't have a budget around acquisitions. We're cautious when we make acquisitions. We like to cultivate relationships over long stretches of time. As has been commented in the marketplace before many times, over the last decade, multiples have risen. So, therefore, we're even more selective than we used to be and we're careful around pro formas, because most of the companies that we acquire are private. And we want to really understand the ongoing characteristics of the business and not some fancy dressed up pro forma statement. And so, the one thing that we're committed to is capital deployment. And so, we look at -- we favor share repurchase -- we favor acquisitions over share repurchase, but we certainly favor share repurchase over building more cash on the balance sheet. And so, we will utilize that circa $4 billion between the dividend, which is 7% and growing acquisitions and then share repurchase. But the M&A pipeline, ebbs and flows, it looks pretty good right now. But we don't really have -- we wouldn't at this stage to have a strong idea of where we would end up the year on that because many of the discussions we have are exclusive and the discussion is essentially the company decided whether they want to join forces with us or stay private. But John, do you want to talk about the pipeline, or how we're looking at M&A these days?
John Doyle: Sure. Good morning, Brian. We did three small deals in the quarter, one at Oliver Wyman, in Australia, one at M&A here, of course, in the United States, and then we did one at Mercer Marsh Benefits in France. So, we remain very active in the market. The pipeline, as Dan noted, is pretty solid. Generally speaking, the pipeline is deepest in the middle market brokerage space, and that's typically where we see some of our best and most attractive opportunities. But I would point out, we've done some more at Oliver Wyman, a lot of work at Oliver Wyman of late, not just in the quarter, but in the later part of last year. You may have seen that we recently announced that we expect to close on Booz Allen Hamilton's Middle Eastern business sometime in the second quarter. So, we'll see how the market evolves. Part of the dynamic here is our reputation as a buyer is very strong in these markets. And so, we get a good look at very attractive assets.
Brian Meredith: Thanks.
Brian Meredith: Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.
Ryan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Just on EMEA within RIS, these results were particularly strong. Just curious if you could give us some color on sort of how demand and trading trends developed, I guess, as the quarter went on and as geopolitical a little more complicated?
Dan Glaser: Sure. John?
John Doyle: Sure. Sure, Ryan. Yeah. We're pleased with our start in EMEA. We had good growth in the U.K. As we've shared in the past, for Continental Europe, the first quarter is a big part of the overall year. So, we're pleased to get off to a strong start. I think the one area that was probably notable on the RIS side is the impact of capital markets, the slowdown in M&A, the slowdown in IPOs. We began to see a bit of an impact as the quarter went on. But overall, demand again for our services remains quite strong and we feel good about how we're positioned all over the world, but in EMEA, in particular.
Ryan Tunis: Got it. And then, on the Mercer side, results were strong again there as well. Could you maybe just remind us, is there a seasonality to discretionary aspect of that? I wasn't sure if perhaps first quarter, there are more discretionary projects and maybe that's why it was outsized, so it's not even throughout the year. And also curious, I guess, for Martine, on the wealth side, with higher interest rates and choppier markets, what are the headwinds and tailwinds the debt produces?
Dan Glaser: Are you sneaking in two questions?
Ryan Tunis: I might have, Dan. Sorry.
Dan Glaser: Thanks. Martine?
Martine Ferland: Yeah. Thank you, Ryan. Well, first, you asked about discretionary project, and I would say, no. This is not -- there's no cycle to this. It's pretty much through the year. It's big project that clients work with us. And there's still lots of demand for these projects. So, of course, we always keep an eye on the outlook. In terms of potential recession, as we know, this is the discretionary projects are a little bit more sensitive to that than other parts of the business. But so far, so good. The demand is really strong. And we see the immediate, a very strong outlook for the year. And you just think about the solutions that we're solving through with our clients in the discretionary projects, whether they are the future of work or -- and there's a link here to your question on the volatility on the wealth business, because when there's uncertainty clients need us to do more modeling or more planning around the investments in the pension plan. So, the bottom line is it's not seasonal. And just to complete the thought on your question on the wealth side, of course, the capital markets have been creating some headwinds on the short-term basis or part of the business that's linked to our assets under management. We call it the outsourced Chief Investment Officer business, OCIO. It's a fantastic business. It's given us many, many years of strong growth. We have strong flows. But, of course, on the short-term, as this business grows in proportion to our portfolio, we will maybe see a little bit more volatility there, but we're able to manage that in the grand scheme of the firm. And we've done so this quarter, because it has been negatively impacted since the beginning of the year. The other thing -- the other end on this, and you've alluded to that in your question is the -- first of all, the AUM portfolio, our assets are diversified. So, there's some risk management in that equity fixed income alternatives. In the long run, it will grow. It's also that this business now is larger than our traditional DB business. And therefore, over the long run, we also see that as a tailwind. And the market volatilities just creates demand for stronger governance, better agility and moving assets from one to the next. And you'll see this as interest rates go up and the pension funding gets better. You'll see clients wanted to secure that and start shifting assets to fixed income and also provides them more opportunity to think of derisking that side of the business, which has been a trend for many years now.
Ryan Tunis: Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Perfect. Next question. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America.
Joshua Shanker: You've been really generous with your time and we're at the end, so I'll be quick. Just one, easy one. Can we just talk about COVID in Asia-PAC right now? And what that means for the coming quarter and how you see that playing out?
Dan Glaser: Sure. I mean, I think, we -- I used the resilience before, it's not just us. I think the world has gotten pretty resilient in that. We're not in 2020 anymore, and we've been able to adapt to different ways that have occurred in certain segments, whether that's in Europe, U.S., Asia, I mean, the one thing about COVID is no part of the world actually escaped. And so, we don't see a tremendous impact on our results from COVID. It would be more of a softer potential impact on just any headwind on GDP or business development. But other than that, we feel pretty good. I mean, you just look at Marsh's results as an example, in Asia-PAC in the quarter, it wasn't -- it's not COVID free. It was pretty active in Asia-PAC. So, in some ways, in terms of impact on our results, we think COVID is pretty much in the rearview mirror as well, knock wood.
Joshua Shanker: Alright. Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan, for any closing remarks.
Dan Glaser: So, thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you next quarter and a particular shout out to all of our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving our clients. So, thank you very much.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-01-27 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh McLennan’s conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. Fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company’s website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website.  During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today’s earnings release.  I’ll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. 
Dan Glaser: Thanks Andrew. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I’m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is John Doyle, our Group President and COO; Mark McGivney, our CFO, and the CEOs of our businesses: Martin South of Marsh, Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter, Martine Ferland of Mercer, and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. John Doyle assumed his new role on January 1, and I am pleased to be working alongside him. During John’s five years as CEO of Marsh, the business thrived under his leadership, experiencing accelerated revenue growth and record new business. He also inspired an even stronger culture of colleague engagement, inclusion and diversity. I look forward to unlocking the greater potential of Marsh McLennan together. I’d also like to welcome Martin South and Dean Klisura, who assumed their new roles on January 1. Martin, who succeeded John as CEO of Marsh, has worked at Marsh for 27 years. Most recently Martin served as CEO of Marsh U.S. and Canada, where he produced a superior track record of growth. Dean Klisura, who succeeds Peter Hearn as CEO of Guy Carpenter, has been with Marsh McLennan for nearly 30 years. During his time at Marsh McLennan, Dean has served in executive leadership roles in Marsh’s global specialties and placement before joining Guy Carpenter last year as President. Dean brings deep knowledge and broad industry relationships to his new role. I look forward to seeing Marsh and Guy Carpenter continue to thrive and grow under their leadership. These moves represent further examples of the extraordinary talent in Marsh McLennan and the seamless process we have built to manage orderly succession.  On behalf of the entire company, I want to express my deep gratitude to Peter Hearn for his exceptional leadership of Guy Carpenter. During Peter’s tenure, Guy Carpenter achieved record financial performance and cultivated a culture where colleagues’ professional success and personal fulfillment is a consistent priority. We look forward to the contributions he will continue to make as Vice Chair of Marsh McLennan. I’d also like to thank Dominic Burke for his many contributions following our acquisition of JLT and wish him the best in his retirement. His leadership ensured our combination with JLT, the largest acquisition in our history, was a win for our clients, for our company, and for our colleagues.  2021 was a banner year for Marsh McLennan. We generated the strongest underlying revenue growth in over two decades with each of our businesses contributing meaningfully. Adjusted EPS growth was 24%, the highest in over two decades. We reported adjusted margin expansion for the 14th consecutive year. We invested meaningfully in our talent and capabilities, both organically and through attractive acquisitions, and we completed our deleveraging and resumed significant share repurchases.  Across the firm, 2021 was a year of extraordinary growth and achievement. Consistent with our philosophy of balancing near term financial results while also investing for the future, we capitalized on available opportunities to make significant investments. This is reflected in an organic increase of nearly 6,000 colleagues on a net basis, the highest level in our history. Our new colleagues not only add scale in client-facing roles but critical capabilities, the capacity to streamline operations, drive efficiencies, enhance client service outcomes, and expand the bandwidth of our market-facing operations.  We pursued attractive acquisitions. MMA broadened its geographic footprint in the key middle market segment with the addition of PayneWest. Oliver Wyman deepened our healthcare expertise and client service capabilities with the acquisition of Huron’s life sciences business, and Marsh enhanced its market-leading position in India with an increase in the ownership stake in our Indian brokerage business from 49% to 92%. Portfolio optimization efforts continued as well, including the sale of Marsh’s U.K. networks, Mercer’s pension administration business in Brazil, and Mercer’s U.S. associations business.  Across the organization, we took steps to accelerate productivity, gain efficiency, and enhance client experience with initiatives like Marsh’s operational excellence program, our build-out of our India and other centers of excellence, and improving our technology and HR functions. 2021 was also a year in which we accelerated impact for clients through innovation in areas of pressing concern. Marsh McLennan provided thought leadership on key global issues in partnership with the World Economic Forum. For the 17th consecutive year, we collaborated in the production of the annual Global Risk Report, which was issued earlier this month. This year’s report identifies climate action failure and extreme weather, the decline of social cohesion, infectious diseases, cyber security failure, mental health deterioration, and digital inequality among the top 10 risks facing society. Marsh McLennan’s business is to help clients adapt to this evolving risk landscape and to plot a course through longer term secular challenges. In areas like cyber risk, climate resilience, digitization, diversity and inclusion, health societies and new ways of working, we’ve brought forward creative solutions for our clients in 2021.  All of this is consistent with our legacy as an innovator for the past 150 years. Since the founding of our company in 1871, we have been at our clients’ sides, finding opportunities and navigating uncertainty in the areas of risk, strategy and people. This approach has translated to significant value creation for our shareholders over time.  Since our IPO in 1962, our consolidated revenue has grown from $52 million to nearly $20 billion. Our adjusted EPS has increased from $0.02 per share to over $6 a share, and our headcount has risen from 3,000 colleagues to nearly 83,000 today. This translates to an average of 11% revenue growth, 10% adjusted EPS growth, and 6% headcount growth each year over this period, and we exit this first century and a half on a high note with terrific 2021 results. Now let me provide an update on current P&C insurance market conditions. Rate increases continued to persist, reflecting losses, low returns, concerns about inflation, and a firming reinsurance market. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 13% year-over-year. This marks the 17th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace.  Looking at pricing by line, the Marsh Market Index showed global property insurance was up 8%, global financial and professional lines were up 31% driven in part by cyber rates more than doubling in some geographies, and global casualty rates were up mid single digits on average. As a reminder, our index skews to large account business; however, small and middle market insurance rates continue to rise as well, although less than for large complex accounts. At the January renewals, capacity in most areas was available, although insurers pushed for price increases and in some cases coverage changes and tighter terms and conditions.  Turning to reinsurance, the January 1 reinsurance renewals reflected an evolving market. Capacity was adequate but reinsurers adjusted their risk appetite and pricing thresholds for certain sectors. This was in response to ongoing and emerging challenges such as the frequency and severity of catastrophe losses, climate change, core inflation, social inflation, and underlying rate increases. The overall Guy Carpenter Global Property Catastrophe Rate-On-Line Index increased 10.8% with non-loss impacted clients being generally flat to up 7%, and loss-impacted up from 10% to over 30%. Marsh McLennan remains focused on helping our clients navigate challenging P&C rates in the evolving risk environment.  As we look ahead to 2022, we’ve continued to see a good runway for growth given the outlook for above average GDP growth, sustained firm P&C pricing conditions, the inflationary impact on exposures, further opportunities from disruption in the brokerage sector, and the benefit of our recent organic investments. Taking a longer view, we believe demand for our solutions will remain strong given rising levels of complexity, volatility and uncertainty across the economic landscape supporting growth in years ahead. The global macroeconomic outlook remains positive even as there continues to be uncertainty due to the omicron variant, geopolitical pressures, supply chain challenges, inflation, and tightening monetary conditions.  In 2021, we broke out of the 3% to 5% underlying growth range of recent years. We believe we will sustain that momentum, driving mid single digit or better growth in 2022. We also expect to continue our track record of annual margin expansion and solid EPS growth.  With that, let me turn it over to John for his comments on the quarter and other business trends.
John Doyle: Thanks Dan, and good morning everyone. I’m excited about the new role and the opportunity to work with Dan and the executive committee on Marsh McLennan’s overall strategic and operational objectives. I’m also excited for the leadership that Martin and Dean bring to Marsh and Guy Carpenter and to support them in their new roles. Since I joined Marsh McLennan almost six years ago, I continue to be impressed by the strength and depth of our talent and capabilities across the areas of risk, strategy and people. I’ve also been impressed by the unwavering commitment of our colleagues to clients, to one another, and to the communities where we live and work. I am meeting with our colleagues, clients and business leaders to identify areas where we can have greater impact and accelerate growth. As Dan noted, our clients are operating in a volatile environment where emerging issues are creating both challenges and opportunities. Our expertise, scale, data and insights position us well to meet their needs. I believe we have meaningful runway to harness the power of Marsh McLennan across our businesses and find the intersections where we can have outsized client impact. Together, we can accelerate innovation, deliver critical solutions, and drive growth and value for shareholders. Marsh McLennan has tremendous momentum, as evidenced by our strong fourth quarter results. Highlights include continued double-digit underlying revenue growth and record adjusted operating income. We closed out a fantastic year with fourth quarter underlying revenue growth of 10%, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and the longest stretch of double digit quarterly growth in over two decades. Looking at risk in insurance services, fourth quarter revenue was $3 billion, up 20% compared with the year ago or 9% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 6% to $557 million, while our adjusted operating margin declined 80 basis points to 22.7%, reflecting investments made in the business. For the year, revenue was a record $12.1 billion with underlying growth of 10%. Adjusted operating income for the year increased 17% to a record $3 billion with a margin of 28.5%, up 50 basis points from the same period a year ago. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.9 billion, up 22% compared with the year ago. Revenue growth was 9% on an underlying basis. U.S. and Canada delivered another exceptional quarter with underlying revenue growth in the double digits for the third consecutive quarter at 11%. In international, underlying revenue growth was 7%. Latin America grew 14%, Asia Pacific was up 10%, and EMEA was up 5%. For the year, Marsh’s revenue was $10.2 billion with underlying growth of 11%. U.S. and Canada underlying revenue growth was 13% and international was up 9%, the highest since we began reporting these regions in 2008. Guy Carpenter’s fourth quarter revenue was $170 million, up 5% on an underlying basis. For the year, Guy Carpenter generated $1.9 billion of revenue and 9% underlying growth.  In the consulting segment, revenue of $2.1 billion was a fourth quarter record, up 10% from a year ago or 11% on an underlying basis, the third consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Adjusted operating income increased 6% to $410 million. The adjusted operating margin was 20.2%, down 120 basis points versus a year ago, reflecting investments in the business. Consulting generated revenue of $7.8 billion for the year, representing underlying growth of 10%, the highest in nearly 15 years. Adjusted operating income for the year increased 19% to $1.5 billion, and the adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 19.8%. Mercer’s revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 6% on an underlying basis. Career grew 15% on an underlying basis. This is the third straight quarter of double digit growth in the Career business. We are seeing strong demand for solutions linked to new ways of working, skills gaps, workforce transformation, and D&I issues like pay equity. Wealth increased 4% on an underlying basis, reflecting growth in both investment management and defined benefits. Our assets under management grew to $415 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 16% year-over-year, benefiting from net new inflows and market gains. Health underlying revenue growth was 4% in the quarter. For the year, revenue at Mercer was $5.3 billion, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis, the highest in over a decade. Oliver Wyman’s revenue in the quarter was $722 million, an increase of 22% on an underlying basis. This represents the fourth consecutive quarter of double digit growth and reflects continued strong demand across geographies and practices. For the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $2.5 billion, an increase of 21% on an underlying basis. Overall, our strong fourth quarter and full year 2021 performance, as well as the investments we made in the year, sets us up for success in 2022 and beyond. Now I’ll turn the call over to Mark for further detail on our financial results and a discussion of our initial outlook for 2022.
Mark McGivney: Thank you John, and good morning.  As Dan and John mentioned, our financial performance in the fourth quarter was strong, capping an outstanding year. We saw another quarter of double-digit underlying revenue growth and meaningful earnings growth despite substantial investments that position us for continued success.  We generated GAAP EPS of $1.57 in the quarter and adjusted EPS of $1.36, up 14% versus a year ago. Operating income was $986 million and adjusted operating income was $905 million, a fourth quarter record. Our adjusted operating margin decreased 90 basis points in the fourth quarter to 20.4%, reflecting significant investments in the business. As we noted on our third quarter call, while we are excited about the future benefits these investments will deliver, they come with upfront cost we absorbed in the short term.  Our full year 2021 results were outstanding. Our adjusted EPS was $6.17, an increase of 24%, the highest is over two decades. Full year operating income was $4.3 billion and our adjusted operating income was also $4.3 billion. Finally, our adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points, marking our 14th consecutive year of margin expansion.  2021 was also a strong year for capital management. We completed our JLT-related deleveraging, enhanced our short term liquidity flexibility, and saw S&P, Moody’s and Fitch restore our rating outlook to stable.  Through solid operating performance and our focus on working capital efficiency, we also exceeded our plans for capital deployment. This included a 15% increase in our dividend and $1.2 billion of share repurchases. This was the highest level of share repurchases since 2015, resulting in a meaningful reduction in our share count. John covered our business operating results, so I’ll cover some of the other aspects of our performance and outlook. Adjusted corporate expense was $62 million in the fourth quarter. As we had expected, foreign exchange was a modest headwind. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.07 headwind in 2022, most of which will affect the first half of the year.  As we typically do on our fourth quarter calls, I will give a brief update on our global retirement plan.  Our other net benefit credit was $66 million on a GAAP basis in the quarter and $277 million for the full year. For 2022, based on our current expectations, we anticipate our other net benefit credit will be about $255 million. Cash contributions to our global defined benefits plans were $129 million in 2021 compared with $143 million in 2020. We expect cash contributions in 2022 will be roughly $180 million. Investment income was $18 million in the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis and $14 million on an adjusted basis. For the full year 2021, our investment income was $61 million on a GAAP basis and $55 million on an adjusted basis.  Interest expense in the fourth quarter was $109 million. Based on our current forecasts, we expect a similar level of quarterly interest expense in 2022.  Our adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 20.6% compared with 24% in the fourth quarter last year, and reflected some discrete benefits we realized in the quarter. For the full year 2021, our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.6% compared to 24.4% for the full year 2020. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year was approximately 25%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume and adjusted effective tax rate of around 25% for 2022.  Turning to capital management and our balance sheet, we ended the year with total debt of $11 billion, including the proceeds from the $750 million of senior notes we issued in December. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem $500 million of senior notes that were scheduled to mature in January. Our next scheduled debt maturity isn’t until March of 2023. Our cash position at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.8 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1.2 billion and included $276 million for dividends, $494 million for acquisitions, and $425 million for share repurchases. For the year, uses of cash totaled $3.7 billion and included $1 billion for dividends, $1.1 billion for acquisitions, $1.2 billion for share repurchases, and $500 million for debt repayment.  Now that we’ve completed our post-JLT deleveraging, we expect to return to our strategy of balanced capital management which supports our consistent focus on delivering solid performance in the near term while investing for sustained growth over the long term. We prioritize reinvestment in the business, both through organic investments and acquisitions.  In 2011, our revenues were $11.5 billion. Today we stand at nearly $20 billion and acquired revenues have accounted for roughly half of this growth. These acquisitions have added critical capabilities, talent, greater scale, expanded insights, and have driven significant value for clients and shareholders. We have consistently said that we prefer acquisitions to share repurchases. We view high quality acquisitions as better at creating value for shareholders and the company over the long term; however, we also recognize that returning capital to shareholders generates meaningful returns for investors over time and each year, we target raising our dividend and reducing our share count.  Looking ahead to 2022, the combination of our available cash and expected cash generation sets us up for another year of significant capital deployment. Based on our outlook today, we currently expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital in 2022 across dividends, acquisitions, and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. As we look to 2022, we are well positioned given the strong momentum across our businesses as well as a largely favorable macroeconomic and P&C pricing backdrop. Based on our outlook today for the full year 2022, we expect to deliver underlying revenue growth of mid single digits or better, margin expansion, and solid growth in adjusted EPS.  Keep in mind 2021 benefited from several items such as significant investment income and favorable discrete tax benefits that can fluctuate considerably from year to year. Also, as you consider the phasing of expenses in 2022, recognize that we made significant investments in talent in 2021 and don’t begin the lap the full impact of these costs until the second half of the year. In summary, 2021 was a remarkable year, one in which all of our businesses delivered outstanding performance. We made substantial organic investments in the business, continued to execute on our acquisition strategy, completed our deleveraging, and resumed meaningful share repurchases. We are proud of the focus and determination of our colleagues and the value they deliver to our clients and shareholders. We close the year on a high note and look forward to another year of strong performance in 2022. With that, I’m happy to turn it back to Dan.
Dan Glaser: Thanks Mark. Operator, we’re ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. 
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is specifically on RIS. If I look at the adjusted comp and benefits as a percent of revenue, it was pretty close to flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and I thought we would have seen a jump there just due to all the new hires that you’ve been referencing. I guess my question is are the costs of the hires fully reflected and what perhaps would have been some of the offsets to keep that ratio flat, and then would you [indiscernible] upward pressure next year, meaning 2022, just given the hires and wage inflation in the system?
Dan Glaser: Thanks Elyse, it’s a good question. I’ll start with it. We’ve said in the past how we look at our business and we manage comp and ben ratios, we actually consider it, and yes, not only in RIS for the total company. Our comp and ben ratio in 2021 is almost identical to the comp and ben ratio in 2020, and the big factor that’s causing that is our revenue growth. Comp and ben is based--the ratios are based upon revenue growth, so the significant 10% revenue growth that we had in the year underlying plus the momentum we had, where we had 10% in the fourth quarter as well, gave us the room to absorb some of this hiring strategy and is one of the reasons why we point to 2021 as, in our view, our best year ever in 150 years. It’s a year where we had tremendous financial performance and dramatic organic investments. But when you think about the hiring at RIS in general, John, do you have anything to add to that?
John Doyle: Yes Elyse, what I would add is that the hiring was principally in three different areas. We’ve tried to be quite strategic and wanted to focus on some of the disruption in the marketplace, so we made strategic hires at Marsh, Guy Carpenter, and Mercer. They have on-boarded, so you asked that question - they joined us mostly in the second half of the year, some on the first of January but largely in the second half of the year.  The second area of hiring, and this was mostly at Marsh, was around the operational excellence program that Dan spoke to. We’re standing up centers of excellence in support of segregation of duties, moving mid back office work to lower cost environments leading to better client outcomes, better colleague experience, but it also will increase over time the capacity of our market-facing colleagues, so we’re excited about that investment.  Then the third area was in early career. We paused in 2020 at the height of the pandemic, but we got back at it last year and on-boarded some early career colleagues. We’re quite bullish on the hiring that we did. We’re in a period now of on-boarding these colleagues and getting them to a productive state as quickly as possible.
Dan Glaser: So basically, Elyse, there’s not a surge of expense coming with regard to the hiring. We’ve been absorbing the additional expense as we go, and we’re very happy that we were able to put up an adjusted EPS growth of 14% despite all the investments that we made in the second and third quarters.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks, then my follow-up would be on the other side of this, the revenue benefits that you guys can see from this incremental hiring. You guys laid out a mid single digit or better organic growth outlook for 2022. Can you help us think about the revenue benefit embedded within that from the hires that you brought on throughout 2021?
Dan Glaser: Yes, I think there’s a few things. One, we’re a capability company, we’re a content company. When we’re hiring somebody, it’s not like, okay, what’s your book of business and how much do we have to pay you and how long is it going to take you to pull that book. It’s really what’s your capability, what do you specialize in, what segments are you an expert in, and our focus over years has been on building that level of capability. Mark was stating that a bit in the script, where we’ve gone from an $11.5 billion company to nearly $20 billion, and half of that is acquisition related - that’s based upon capability, not somebody who can pull an account or two. The way I would look at it would be we do expect to grow more over time based upon our hiring strategy - that’s absolutely true. We think it could take two or three years before people are operating at their optimum, whether that is a producer, a client-facing colleague, or somebody who’s working in our service areas, that ultimately it takes some time for people to embed into a new company, a new culture, a new team, and so we give them that time. But when we talk about mid single digit or better for 2022, it’s really looking at a number of factors - better global GDP growth than on average, strong P&C market, the organic hiring strategy that we’ve done, and the capabilities that we’ve built.  Our goal is now that we’ve broke out of that 3% to 5% world, is to stay above that, and not just in 2022, it’s beyond that and therefore we think that the hiring strategy has a lot to do with how we’re going to perform in 2023 and 2024 as well. It is a permanent capability added to the firm. Next question, please?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan. 
Jimmy Bhullar: Hey, good morning. First I had a question on what you think about the acquisition pipeline, and just comment on competition for deals and how you’re seeing multiples for potential targets. Obviously the public brokers are all trading at fairly high multiples versus historically. Are you seeing that in the private market as well, and just any comments on the pipeline.
Dan Glaser: Yes, I’ll take that a little bit and then I’ll hand off to John to talk about the business more broadly on the M&A front. I would say first of all, we referenced that we’ve been around for 150 years and that the firm was founded via a combination of Donald McLennan and Henry Marsh and their agencies, so we have been active in acquisitions for 150 years and we intend to do so. Having said that, we have no budget on acquisitions. We’re not particularly opportunistic, we’re strategic. We build the pipeline over years and we’re patient, so when you talk about things like competition around acquisitions, that’s not us.  We’re talking to companies that ultimately they have their ability to sell to anybody. They choose to want to be part of Marsh McLennan. They want to be part of the A-team and they believe that they can grow and they can offer their colleagues an opportunity to grow within Marsh McLennan which is beyond what they would be able to do with any other firm. When you hear about all this competition and froth, we’re usually not engaged in that. There’s many times where we don’t even pick up the deck or the teaser, because there’s a process. Now having said that, multiples over a number of years have increased. I don’t think particularly in recent times they’ve increased much, but it’s fair to say that over the last couple of years, they’re higher than they were five or six years ago, so you have to be really careful and make sure when you’re going through a pro forma, because most of these acquisitions are private companies, to make sure that you understand how the P&L works, because the actual and the pro forma is often quite different.  I would say in general, our pipeline looks good and that we’re not on any timetable or budget, and we’ll just see how it goes. We will deploy that capital, so as Mark was saying, if we don’t use it in acquisitions, which we favor, we will use it in share repurchase, and either way we probably have a reasonable amount of both acquisition and share repurchase. John, what can you see in the pipeline and what do you see in the market in general on the acquisition front?
John Doyle: Sure. We remain active in the market, Jimmy, for sure. As Dan noted, we have a good, solid pipeline. We did seven deals in the fourth quarter, three at MMA, modest deals at MMA, we did three deals at Marsh as well, one quite small but India, of course, was quite important and very strategic for us. We also acquired an Affinity broker in France, so we’re excited about what that can do for our business there, and then of course we did Huron, as Dan mentioned in his prepared remarks earlier. We’re looking for strong performing businesses that are well led, that make us better in some way - they either fit a market that we’re not serving at the moment or particularly strong in, or in a geography maybe that we don’t cover all that well. An example of that was last year with the acquisition of PayneWest, which was a high performing business, outstanding leadership team, performing well, and they’re just a terrific cultural fit and it fit perfectly for us in the upper northwest of MMA’s operations here in the United States. We’ll continue to be active, and maybe one thing just to add on the multiple side, we’ve seen some MGAs that I think--certainly some very, very high multiples in the MGA market. I think many of them are kind of trading under the insuretech label and so driving some interest there. We haven’t been particularly active in that market. We keep a close eye on it and we serve many of them as clients through Guy Carpenter, but outside of that we’ve earned a terrific reputation in the market, and so we end up with good, high quality conversations before things go to market. 
Dan Glaser: Just one other thing, just adding--you know, OW has been a tremendous acquisition for the company from back to, whenever - 2003 or 2004. It’s now a $2.5 billion management consulting company with all kinds of capability, and it was good to see OW out there acquiring Huron’s life sciences business, which again adds capability to the firm and will help us grow more into the future. Jimmy, do you have a follow-up?
Jimmy Bhullar: Yes, and it’s partly on OW. Overall, if you think about organic growth, obviously it’s benefited in a number of your businesses from the economic recovery, and especially at Oliver Wyman. But with omicron picking up in December and into January, should we assume a little bit of an impact on some of your businesses or not much across the enterprise?
Dan Glaser: I’ll hand off to both Nick and Martine to give a little comment about whether they’re seeing an omicron impact. My overall feeling is the world has become pretty resilient and has learned to adapt, and so therefore GDP projections, while they’ve come down a bit in our major countries, they’re still relatively strong compared to four or five years ago. But why don’t we do to you first, Nick, and then to Martine about whether you’re seeing any impact of omicron on your business.
Nick Studer: Thanks very much Dan. Thanks Jimmy for the question. You’re right - our business does tend to prosper when the economy is really healthy, but I think we also see that when our clients’ questions change, they often need more support, and the short answer is we’re not seeing any slowdown in the business in the first quarter. Our pipeline is strong, and really over the last 12 months and still well into the first quarter, we’re optimistic because the growth is very broad-based across almost every single one of our industry areas and the vast majority of our capabilities, whether it’s payments or private equity, whether it’s climate or digital, whether it’s growth strategy or cost management and restructuring. It is broad-based growth, and we’re not seeing an omicron effect. 
Dan Glaser: Thanks. Martine?
Martine Ferland: Yes, very similarly to Nick--and thanks for the question, Jimmy, I will focus a bit on Career here because that’s the part of Mercer that is more connected to the economy. Similarly, we’ve come into the year with good momentum, strong sales, and what we’ve been busy with for the last part of ’21 has not gone away - if anything, it’s continuing to accelerate, whether it’s a talent war, labor shortage, skill gaps, redefining the way that we work, the return to work that has been in and out, in and out in many countries. That’s keeping the team busy. For now, we’re not seeing much of an impact, and if anything, commenting on health a little bit, that has also been impacted. We have seen enrolled lives come up, we don’t see this going away, at least not in the near future, and some medical inflation returning as well, impacting premiums because the non-COVID medical treatment has picked up. We might see a little bit of a gap there due to omicron, but I don’t think it will last.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Wolfe Research.
Mike Zaremski: Great, good morning. Maybe switching gears to the property and casualty insurance marketplace, I think in the comments in the outlook, you talked about a strong P&C market. From the prepared remarks, I think you cited the Marsh index, it seems like pricing had decelerated a couple points but still at kind of high absolute levels. Are you seeing a deceleration in pricing amongst your clients?
Dan Glaser: John, you want to take that?
John Doyle: Sure Mike. As Dan noted, it was the 17th consecutive quarter of price increases, so this market obviously has had some legs, at least compared to the time that I’ve been in it, which is a long time. There was some moderation in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. I think cyber is probably the biggest outlier in all this. Maybe Mark and Dean can talk about their observations in a second, but the underwriting community in cyber of course is still reacting to the frequency and severity of ransomware claims, and they’re worried about systemic events as well but I think the market reaction right now is more driven by ransomware losses. The market remains challenging for our clients, and broadly speaking the underwriting community is worried about property cat losses, the impact of inflation on loss cost, and as I mentioned earlier, cyber related claims. Martin, you want to share some thoughts about the market?
Martin South: Yes John, thank you. As you said, there’s a slight deceleration of the global rate index, it’s down by a couple of points from 15 to 13. You’ve seen deceleration in most of the geographies. An interesting outlier in Latin America, where rate increases continue to be strong. If I turn to cat lines and more cat-exposed areas, still strength there. [Indiscernible] casualty, which is still showing some deceleration, there’s still strength in the umbrella area in the property book. Those that are multi-line and multilayer insurers are double what you see for single carriers, so where there are cat exposures, you’re still seeing price increases, and that’s a trend you’re seeing across the board. As you said, John, on cyber, very strong, almost double in Europe and over 100% in North America for cyber, so still strength.
John Doyle: Got it, thanks Martin. Dean, we just had a big reinsurance renewal January 1. What’s happening in the reinsurance market?
Dean Klisura: Thank you John. As discussed, the reinsurance market at January 1, the renewal was very late; however, overall placements were very orderly and everything got completed. Clearly reinsurers differentiated among individual risks. Pricing has been bifurcated between loss impacted and non-loss impacted accounts. As Dan mentioned earlier, the Guy Carpenter Global Property Catastrophe Rate-On-Line Index increased to 10.8%, the largest increase in 15 years. Capacity is ample across most lines of business but certainly more constrained in the catastrophe property market that John mentioned, the cyber market, particularly the cyber aggregate market and certainly the retrocession market. 
John Doyle: Got it, thank you Dean. Another question, Mike?
Mike Zaremski: Yes, a quick follow-up. This might be for Mark McGivney. If short term interest rates do indeed move higher over the coming year or years, would Marsh get a slight benefit from fiduciary investment income levels?
Dan Glaser: Mark, do you want to handle that?
Mark McGivney: Yes. Mike, we would. Fiduciary interest income in 2021, I hope bottomed out at $15 million. If you look back just two years ago, it was $105 million, so the pandemic and the impact on short term rates really took the wind out of that line item. If rates climb, that certainly is a source of opportunity for us. Just keep in mind as you think about 2022, it’s a function of not only how rates move, when they move and where they move. We’ve got fiduciary balances outside of the U.S., obviously, but certainly if rates go up over the next couple of years, that’s opportunity for us.
Dan Glaser: Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you very much, good morning. My first question goes back to, I think, some of the comments you made regarding the previous question, which was around wage inflation and its potential impact on revenues, both in RIS and in consulting. How do you see that playing out? Is it more of a headwind, more of a tailwind for 2022?
Dan Glaser: Well, I would say wage inflation in general would--well, let’s take it broader. Inflation in general would be a bit of a tailwind for us because when we look at past cycles, Marsh McLennan tends to do a bit better in inflationary periods than what preceded them, so writ large, probably a mild benefit because of exposure unit growth, principally. Now wage inflation in particular, it’s hard to see how that would be more than a negative for our clients and for ourselves, but when you think about it, some of the rating factors that are utilized to figure out, say, some casualty and some medical benefits, etc., are based upon headcount and also sometimes on payroll, so if payroll is rising, that means the exposure unit’s rising, so it’s pretty moderate.  Now, we’re very wary, of course, like everybody else, about wage inflation, but I start from the basis of what I was saying to Elyse earlier - our comp and ben ratios have been very consistent over time. We have shared the growth of the company with our colleagues, and it’s not a one-year wonder, it’s for multiple years. It’s not all about pay, it’s also about what kind of company you are, what kind of caring employer, how you treat your colleagues, etc., and so we create an environment at Marsh McLennan we really strive to make it a great place to work, and we’ll continue to do that. While we’re watchful about wage inflation, we haven’t really seen much of that, and it would be masked in any event by our variable comp, which is based upon net operating income, so that risen pretty significantly over a number of years.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you for the comments. Then a follow-up on cyber - just curious as to how clients view this line item. Is this a non-discretionary item for most of them? What I’m trying to get at is with no real slowdown in the rate increases we’re seeing there, is there risk that clients ultimately start buying down or not buying cyber coverage?
Dan Glaser: John?
John Doyle: Look, at some point would that become the case? Sure, that’s a potential, but I don’t think we’re running into that risk at the moment. And by the way, is it discretionary? Yes, it’s discretionary. I would say about 50% of our clients in the United States, only 50% of them buy standalone cyber coverage and about 25% of our clients outside the United States buy standalone cyber coverage. The market is finding an equilibrium, it’s sorting out how to deal with ransomware. When Martin talked about the price increase, that doesn’t all manifest itself in premium growth or increased premiums for our clients. Underwriters are insisting on higher attachment points, co-insurance for ransomware, sub-limits for example - that all gets factored into the rate change that we talk about, so we work with our clients and we work with the markets to try to find the best way to finance the risk. It’s not just financing risk after the fact, of course. We’re actively working across the entire firm - Marsh, Guy Carpenter, Oliver Wyman, Mercer to help our clients better understand the risk and take steps to mitigate the risk upfront, but also the impact of an event once it happens. 
Dan Glaser: Yes, so Yiron, cyber is going to be a tremendous growth market for us. We’re nowhere close to saturation, where clients will start not buying cyber because of the price. You have to bear in mind that this is a significant governance issue for most boards - it’s like an ESG issue, and so you’d have to be a pretty brave company to decide to not buy cyber if it’s presented to you at a board level.  Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. I wanted to start with the question on risk and insurance services. We’ve had other operating expenses up $139 million on a year-over-year basis, and I’m trying to figure out how much of that was adjusted out. Maybe just give a sense of the underlying increase in other operating expenses. 
Dan Glaser: Yes, if you look at all other expenses other than comp and ben for the year, all other expenses in 2021 were up 1%, and that’s across the firm, so really this has been--you know, if you look at our underlying expense growth for the year, comp and ben is 85% of that growth and variable comp and ben is two-thirds of that 85%, so this is really about the opportunity we saw and the strategy we put in place to increase the size of the firm through a concerted effort around organic hiring. It doesn’t have to do with all expenses. It’s fair to say that certain all other expenses that are more discretionary in the fourth quarter, like T&E and meetings, marketing, increased over 2020’s fourth quarter, but still relative to the entire year, they were only up 1%.
Meyer Shields: Okay, perfect. That’s fantastic. Then a question for Dean - I think you had commented--I’m going to get the quote wrong, but you said that basically reinsurance placements got done at 1/1. We certainly heard some commentary on difficulty accessing aggregate programs and retro. Was just hoping you could talk about those components specifically.
Dan Glaser: Dean?
Dean Klisura: Sure. Those components of the market were clearly challenging at 1/1. I mentioned cyber aggregates programs - you know, reinsurers definitely pulled back some capacity there around cyber aggregate capacity. Just like property catastrophe, capacity was certainly pulled back by key reinsurers, and probably the most challenging part of the market on 1/1 was the retrocession market, where we saw several ILS funds based in Bermuda really kind of pull back. You had investors pulling capital out, redemption, catastrophic losses from climate change and other cat losses impacting their results, so clearly that was the most challenging part of the market on the January 1 renewal.
Dan Glaser: Thanks Dean. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Dan, you spoke about absorbing some of the expenses in 2021 just due to the hiring. Could you just help us think about how much the hiring activity dragged or impacted margins in 2021, because I’m thinking that as we go through 2022 and those producers start to ramp up, that could be less of a drag, so I’m just trying to quantify that just as I think about comparing margins in ’22 versus ’21.
Dan Glaser: Sure. Certainly the hiring will be less of a drag in 2022, particularly in the back half of the year when we start to lap the decisions we’ve made and the on-boarding that we’ve done. We don’t overly focus on margins within the company, we focus on growing the firm and earnings, so both underlying revenue and earnings. Margins are an outcome of how we run the business. Revenue growth exceeds expense growth in almost every quarter and certainly every year, as it’s done for 14 years. We expect to grow margins in 2022 and we think that our margins should be viewed over long stretches of time, certainly not a quarter or two. We’re very happy with 2021 because, as I was mentioning earlier, we had a tremendous financial performance and we invested heavily in the business, and when I say heavily, invested heavily--more heavily in hiring in 2021 than in any time in our 150 year history. It positions us very well, and we look at 2021 - we grew margins in 2021 despite all of the organic investments that we’ve made. Our margin was up 70 BPs in RIS--or 70 BPs overall, 50 in RIS, and consulting was up 100 BPs, so overall I think we’re ticking the box on margin. We expect margin expansion, we expect strong adjusted EPS growth, and we expect to grow mid single digits or higher, so 2022 for us is going to be another terrific year. Now, it’s pretty hard to have two banner years in a row. I’m not going to sit here and say it’s not a tough comp when you grow adjusted EPS 24%, but having said that, we expect strong adjusted EPS growth in 2022.
David Motemaden: Great, that makes sense. Then maybe just on that, obviously 6,000 producers added in 2021--
Dan Glaser: Well, I kind of wish that they were 6,000 producers there, David, but they’re not 6,000 producers. It is a portion of that is production-related talent, but it also gave us the opportunity to build service capability. There’s an old adage about more sales doesn’t equal better service, better service always equals more sales, so we invested in service as much as we did in sales.
David Motemaden: Right, thanks for that clarification. I guess you did mention there is disruption still and opportunities still. I’m just wondering on the hiring pipeline, I’m assuming has this disruption started to stabilize maybe a little bit less, or are you still seeing the opportunities to add talent?
Dan Glaser: Well, I’m going to hand off to John, but I’ll start by just saying this is a professional service firm issue, not an issue particularly within RIS. On balance, we have smart, high talent, creative, hard-working people, as does a lot of professional services firms. Each of our employees, each of our colleagues has all kinds of opportunities. Our job is to make us an ideal place for them to give their careers, so there is a--it almost became a cliché in terms of the war for talent when you go back four years ago, five years ago. It’s not a cliché anymore - there is a significant amount of talent movement that occurred at the latter stages of the pandemic, and that probably will continue. We’re in that, so it’s not necessarily disruption because of issues within the RIS segment, there’s disruption in society around where people choose to work and how they work. John, can you add to that?
John Doyle: Sure. David, we have an excellent brand as an employer, I think as evidenced by the amount of talent we were able to attract last year. We’ve got purpose-driven culture, our colleagues are highly engaged, we do impactful work, we’re a collaborative place to work. You feel like you’re part of a team when you work at Marsh McLennan. It’s also a place where you can learn and develop, as Dan noted before, and we pay well too. Pay is not everything, of course, but it’s important.  We took the opportunity last year to strengthen the team. I talked about the three different areas earlier - strat hires, service centers, and in early career. I think we started 2021 with the best team on the field, and we’re starting 2022 even stronger. Our focus is on on-boarding and getting those colleagues productive, but we will be active in the market and take advantage of our brand at times, but we won’t have the same level of organic hiring in 2022. 
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan for any closing remarks.
Dan Glaser: Thank you. I thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning.  2021 may have been our best ever. It was a year of tremendous financial performance and dramatic organic investment. Our competitive position has never been stronger and we enhanced our leading position this year.  People use the term, fortress balance sheet, to describe the strength of their firm. We are an ideas company, a people business, and I would say that Marsh McLennan has a fortress talent base that got even stronger this year. I want to thank our 83,000 colleagues for their commitment, hard work and dedication to Marsh McLennan.  Thank you all very much, and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-21 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan's Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Third quarter 2021 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh & McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan.
Dan Glaser: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I am Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer, of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh & McLennan had another outstanding quarter. Our third quarter results reflects strong momentum across all of our businesses. Our continued strength represents a combination of the current environment as well as impressive day-to-day execution across the firm. Although there continues to be uncertainty and volatility in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, we are seeing solid demand for our differentiated advice and solutions. Even as COVID-19 continues to pose risk in many parts of the world, vaccine rollouts are having a positive impact. We are taking advantage of opportunities to add to our deep bench of world class talent. At the core of our business is a focus on our colleagues and we are dedicated to Marsh & McLennan being an exciting and dynamic place to work for outstanding people. And we continue to innovate and leverage the collective strengths of our organization to help clients address their most pressing concerns including climate, diversity and inclusion, the future of work, cyber, and digital strategies.  As we have discussed 2021 represents Marsh & McLennan’s 158th year and success over such a long period of time requires constant innovation and investment to deliver sustained growth and profitability. I'd like to discuss just a few recent examples of how we are innovating to develop new unique client solutions. Nick Studer leads our firm wide climate initiative. We view climate as a significant opportunity and we are well positioned to help clients with this critical issue. In October Oliver Wyman launched the climate action navigator drawing on insights from across the company. This product helps public and private sector leaders plot a path through climate science, identifying emissions at the industry and regional level, and quantifying the effects of multiple different carbon reduction technologies and actions. We believe these tools will give business and government leaders vital insights to achieve their long-term climate goals and be a significant enabler of the transition to low carbon climate resilient investments in the corporate sector.  Mercer recently launched Skills-Edge, an innovative platform allowing employers to determine the most important skills for their future and design a talent strategy to assess, acquire, and retain them. Skills-Edge provides quantitative insight into the demand and value of skills that supports both employees and organizations and rapidly re-skilling for the future of work. And just last week under the leadership of John Doyle we launched our Cyber Risk Analytics Center, this brings together cyber risk data and analytics expertise across our firm and provides clients with a comprehensive assessment of their cyber threats existing in future controls and the potential economic impact. We are one enterprise and these are just a few recent examples of how we bring together and leverage knowledge and capabilities across the firm to offer comprehensive solutions to our clients and address their most pressing concerns.  We are a growth company as demonstrated by our track record. Growth doesn't just happen, it takes consistent vision, alignment, commitment, and execution. Since closing our acquisition of JLT we've grown our total consolidated revenue by 27%, our adjusted EPS by 34%, and our colleague base by 22%. Achieving and sustaining growth requires consistent reinvestment in the business. We always strive to balance delivering results in the short-term while investing for the long-term. In 2021 we generated year-to-date adjusted EPS growth that is higher than any annual period in over three decades while at the same time investing for the future and making a significant press on hiring. We grew our headcount year-to-date by nearly 5000 or around 7% mostly organic adds with an emphasis on client facing roles. We expect this influx of talent will drive growth, add to our capabilities, and enhance our ability to serve clients.  Now let me provide an update on current PNC insurance market conditions. Many of the factors that drove the market to harden over the last few years continue suggesting an inflection to a soft market is unlikely in the near-term. The Marsh Global Insurance market index showed price increases of 15% year-over-year consistent with the second quarter. This marks the 16th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial PNC insurance market place. Looking at pricing by line the Marsh market index showed global property insurance was up 9%, global financial and professional lines were up 32% driven in part by a near doubling in cyber rates, and global casually rates were up high single digits on average. As a reminder our index skews to large account business. However small and middle market insurance rates continued to rise as well although less than for large complex accounts.  Turning to reinsurance, measured and moderate rate increases in global property catastrophe reinsurance witnessed in the first half of 2021 could persist throughout the remainder of the year reflecting adequate capacity offset by elevated global catastrophes, concerns around real end social inflation, and a continuation of large individual risk losses. 2021 marks another year of significant catastrophe losses. Hurricane Ida generated material losses in both the Southeast and Northeast. This is in addition to a record level of flood losses in Europe, flooding in China, and the continuation of wildfire losses in many parts of the world. Marsh & McLennan remains focused on helping our clients navigate these challenging market conditions and making a difference for them in the moments that matter.  Now let me turn to our terrific third quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.08 which is up 32% versus a year ago driven by strong top line growth and continued low levels of T&E. Total revenue increased 16% versus a year ago and rose 13% on an underlying basis. The second consecutive quarter of record underlying growth in over two decades. Underlying revenue grew 13% in RIS and 12% in consulting. Marsh grew 13% in the quarter on an underlying basis and benefited from strong new business and renewal growth. Guy Carpenter grew 15% on an underlying basis in the quarter, continuing its string of excellent results. Mercer underlying revenue grew 7% in the quarter the highest in over a decade. Oliver Wyman grew underlying revenue 25%, the second consecutive quarter in excess of 20%. Overall the third quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 19% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points year-over-year.  Given our excellent third quarter and year-to-date performance we are on track for a terrific year. We expect to generate the best underlying revenue and adjusted EPS growth in over two decades and expand margins for the 14th consecutive year. Our entire organization is on its front foot, focused and aligned and this is evident in our excellent results. With that let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results. 
Mark McGivney: Thank you Dan and good morning. Our results were outstanding with record third quarter revenue, second consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying growth, margin expansion, and significant earnings growth. Highlights from our third quarter performance included the second straight quarter of 13% underlying growth in RIS with 13% at Marsh and 15% in Guy Carpenter and the second consecutive quarter of 12% underlying growth in consulting with 7% at Mercer and 25% at Oliver Wyman. Growth and adjusted earnings per share exceeded 30% for the second quarter in a row. Consolidated revenue increased 16% in the third quarter to 4.6 billion reflecting underlying growth of 13%.  Operating income in the quarter was 740 million, an increase of 37%. Adjusted operating income increased 19% to 759 million and our adjusted operating margin increased 10 basis points to 18.5%. GAAP EPS was $1.05 in the quarter and adjusted EPS increased 32% to $1.08. For the first nine months of 2021, underlying revenue growth was 10%, our adjusted operating income grew 21% to 3.4 billion, our adjusted operating margin increased 120 basis points, and our adjusted EPS increased 28% to $4.82.  Looking at risk and insurance services, third quarter revenue was 2.7 billion up 17% compared with the year ago or 13% on an underlying basis. Operating income increased 21% to 403 million. Adjusted operating income also increased 21% to 469 million and our adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 20.4%. For the first nine months of the year, revenue was 9 billion with underlying growth of 11%. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year increased 20% to 2.5 billion with a margin of 30.3% up 80 basis points from the same period a year ago.  At Marsh revenue in the quarter was 2.4 billion, up 17% compared with the year ago or 13% on an underlying basis. Growth in the quarter was broad based and driven by nearly 40% new business growth and solid retention. U.S. and Canada delivered another exceptional quarter with underlying revenue growth of 16%. In international underlying growth was 9%, Latin America grew 12%, it’s the best growth since the fourth quarter of 2015, Asia Pacific was up 9%, and EMEA was up 8%. For the first nine months of the year Marsh's revenue was 7.3 billion with underlying growth of 12%. U.S. and Canada underlying growth was 14% and international was up 9%.  Guy Carpenter’s third quarter revenue was 314 million up 15% compared with the year ago on both the GAAP and underlying basis. Growth was broad based across geographies and specialties. Guy Carpenter has now achieved 7% or higher underlying growth in seven of the last nine quarters. In the first nine months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated 1.7 billion of revenue and 10% underlying growth.  In the consulting segment revenue in the quarter was 1.9 billion up 13% from a year ago or 12% on an underlying basis. Operating income increased 45% to 404 million. Adjusted operating income increased 15% to 350 million. The adjusted operating margin was 18.9% in line with the margin in the third quarter of 2020. Consulting generated revenue of 5.7 billion for the first nine months of 2021 representing underlying growth of 9%. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year increased 25% to 1.1 billion and the adjusted operating margin expanded 180 basis points to 19.6%.  Mercer’s revenue was 1.3 billion in the quarter up 7% on an underlying basis, the highest result in over a decade. Career grew 13% on an underlying basis reflecting the continuing rebound in the global economy and business confidence. Wealth increased 6% on an underlying basis reflecting strong growth in investment management and modest growth in defined benefit. Our assets under delegated management grew to nearly 400 billion at the end of the third quarter up 24% year-over-year benefiting from net new inflows and market gains. Help underlying revenue growth was 4% in the quarter driven by growth outside the U.S.  Oliver Wyman’s revenue in the quarter was 610 million, an increase of 25% on an underlying basis. This represents the second consecutive quarter of more than 20% growth as demand remains strong across most geographies and practices. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was 1.8 billion, an increase of 21% on an underlying basis. Adjusted corporate expense was 60 million in the third quarter. Foreign exchange had a negligible impact on earnings in Q3. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels we expect FX to be a modest headwind in the fourth quarter. Our other net benefit credit was 69 million in the quarter and we expect it will remain at this level in the fourth quarter. Investment income was 13 million in the quarter on a GAAP basis and 12 million on an adjusted basis and mainly reflects gains on our private equity portfolio.  Interest expense in the third quarter was 107 million compared with 128 million in the third quarter of 2020 reflecting lower debt levels in the period. Based on our current forecast we expect interest expense in the fourth quarter to be similar to the amount in the third quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 24.4% compared with 26.5% in the third quarter last year. Our GAAP tax rate was 24.2% in the third quarter down from 30.3% in the third quarter of 2020 which was impacted by some unusual items. Through the first nine months of the year, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.4% compared with 24.6% last year. Based on the current environment we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2021 excluding discrete items.  Given our year-to-date performance we are on track for an outstanding year. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter keep in mind that comparisons become more challenging given the rebound in growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. We also continue to build for the long-term by investing and hiring. While we are excited about the future benefit these investments will deliver, they come with upfront costs we absorb in the short-term. That said, we have consistently demonstrated our ability to deliver exceptional results today while investing for the future and expect we will continue to do so.  Turning to capital management and our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with 10.7 billion of total debt. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in January of 2022 when 500 million of senior notes mature. We continue to expect to deploy at least 3.5 billion of capital in 2021 of which at least 3 billion will be deployed across dividends, acquisition, and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchases will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops.  Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was 1.4 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled 665 million and included 272 million for dividends, 93 million for acquisitions, and 300 million for share repurchases. For the first nine months uses of cash totaled 2.6 billion and included 750 million for dividends, 566 million for acquisitions, 734 million for share repurchases, and 500 million for debt repayment. We had a remarkable third quarter positioning us well to deliver strong growth in both revenue and adjusted earnings in 2021 and with that I'm happy to turn it back to Dan. 
Dan Glaser: Thanks Mark. And operator we are ready to begin Q&A. 
Operator: Thank you. . Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. 
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, good morning. My first question goes back to the hiring that you guys have done, it seems continued in the third quarter. I was hoping to get more color on the impact you're seeing to both margin and top line growth. I think you alluded to some of that coming through on the expense and margin side from the hiring. But I'm hoping to get a sense of just the potential growth that could come from these hires given  as well as potential RFPs on renewals coming in 2022? 
Dan Glaser: Yeah, thanks Elyse. We've been at it for 150 years so things like gardening leaves don't bother us all that much. Yeah we're definitely in it for the long haul. As we mentioned in the script, our head count growth year-to-date is up nearly 5000 across the firm and the highest percentage growth by far is in Marsh and Guy Carpenter and of course the majority of the hiring that we've done is in client facing roles. And so we may not be like other firms and that we generally hire to grow capability and talent rather than direct short-term revenue production. But having said that, we are a people business, our colleagues are our engine of growth, and undoubtedly our increased hiring in 2021 will benefit next year and beyond. Sometimes it takes a bit of time to get all the hires fully integrated into the firm and producing levels in terms of their own capacity at an optimal level but we're very comfortable with that. And of course there's a cost factor with that, we are not shy to face sophisticated talent is expensive. But it's worth it and that's why we pursue it. And I don't want anyone to worry out there about our long-term expense base, why all of this hiring. We know how to run the business. Our comp and ben ratio if I look at Q3 on a rolling four quarter basis and then go back five years and locate Q3 on a rolling four quarter basis is virtually identical. So, over time we're building the company, we're doing it through organic and we're doing it through acquisition. Next question. 
Elyse Greenspan: Thank and then my follow-up. 
Dan Glaser: Go ahead Elyse. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan. 
Dan Glaser: Thanks, and Andrew maybe later we go back to Elyse because she did not get a chance to ask her follow-up. 
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So I just had a question on pricing and if you could talk about what's going in primary commercial as well as reinsurance and then how much of a pushback are you seeing from clients now that they're facing sort of price on price because rates have been going up for a while now? 
Dan Glaser: That's a very good question Jimmy. And it is a tough market out there. Why don't we start with John and then we'll go to Peter afterwards and we will address the primary markets in reinsurance. So John? 
John Q. Doyle: Sure, good morning Jimmy. As you noted the PNC market conditions remain pretty challenging for our clients, prices were up about 15% on average in the quarter which was consistent with the second quarter. The property market was plus 9 versus plus 12 in the second quarter. It was obviously quite an active cat quarter, flood and wind and wildfire related losses but secondary perils are getting a lot of attention from the underwriting community in the market. Cat was up about 6 although up closer to double-digit globally when you exclude the work comp market in the United States where things remained pretty competitive. The excess market remained particularly challenging here in the United States, the underwriting community worried about our lost cost inflation, social inflation really as courts reopened from being largely closed during the pandemic. The financial lines market I think on average is the most difficult market for the moment for our clients although having said that public D&O pricing is still up but it's up about 10 points versus 15 points in the second quarter and that pricing -- that price increase, that rate of increase is the lowest it's been in the last ten quarter. So starting to see a little bit of settling on that work. Without question the market that is most challenging at the moment is the cyber market where prices were up more than 90% on average driven by material growth in ransom wear plans I'm sure you're familiar with, as well as concerns about systemic events. We have had a few events that maybe modest compared to what potentially could happen but underwriters remain concerned about that. You asked about clients, certainly frustrated by it for sure and some are retaining more risk, we've been a pretty active in creating new captives and there's a premium growth in the captives that we manage as well. Some are also electing to retain more risk and then in some cases of course the market is forcing some of our clients to retain more risk. So, it's client by client and exposure by exposure. As Dan said we are aggressively working to help our clients navigate the market. I will add that although on average the price was -- the average increase was the same globally, most markets did see great moderation. The United States was really the one exception when you look at it on a global basis. 
Dan Glaser: Thanks John. Peter? 
Peter Hearn: Thank you Dan. Jimmy, a lot of my comments reflect from a reinsurance perspective what John has said on insurance perspective. You have had market share in dealing with real and social inflation. They're dealing with low interest rate environment and on top of that we're facing something approaching $100 billion of global capacity losses in 2021. So I think it's safe to say that prospect of that will influence property reinsurance pricing at 1/1/22. But you have to look at the market through various lunges because there's a property market that has been affected by $300 billion plus losses over the last five years, of capacity losses. If you look at the cash market, the significant underlying rate lift has stabilized and improved significantly. Property reinsurance, -- casualty reinsurance contracts and so I would say the casualty market has been more stable. As John says and the same is true in reinsurance, if I would suggest, there is one hard element of our market right now it is cyber. I think reinsurers are looking at cyber capacity the same way they look at property catastrophe capacity with it allocated certain amount of aggregate and once they hit that aggregate that’s it. So, I would say as you know we don't opine on 1/1 pricing or any significant quarter pricing we believe the market finds its own equilibrium and as a result of that we are preparing our clients based on exposure and experience for what they might expect at 1/1. But certainly the property market given the fact this is now the fifth year that reinsurers have had losses is going to be challenging. 
Dan Glaser: Thanks Peter and Jimmy do you have a follow-up. 
Jimmy Bhullar: Maybe I will ask just one on expenses and obviously in the near-term I'm assuming T&E is going to stay depressed but as you think about your expenses longer term, are there things that you're going to change resulting from the pandemic whether it's a lower real estate footprint or whatever else that you think provides you more of a long term benefit? 
Dan Glaser: Yeah, I mean when we look at the impact of the pandemic, I think one of the biggest features is that most organizations will -- of our size and scale will adapt some sort of hybrid model. I think the days of 9 to 5 or 8 to 6, five days a week in the office are over for most companies. And so that will have an impact. It's a longer-term impact because in the short-term you've got your leases established and we want some social distancing in the office and we're not sure how this will develop over time. So we're going to be deliberate and flexible. We're not going to move that quickly on it. I mean we've had efforts over many years to become more efficient in our use of space and we've accomplished that quite a bit and that continues. But that certainly is our view. We also think that T&E won’t come back quickly and may not reach the level of 2019 for quite a while. And I know in Marsh & McLennan our view is yes, we look forward to a day where we are going to visit clients in markets in their location. But we will travel with more purpose, we will probably travel with less people on various trips. And we will be more deliberate about it and I think that our clients will have that expectation as well.  So that hop on a plane anytime anywhere culture probably takes quite a long time to come back if ever. And so both of those things have expense implications for us that will be positive for shareholders in the long-term. And I would say the other thing is we are constantly seeking efficiency gains and we're working throughout the firm in order to drive efficiency gains and to become better at operations. So, why don’t I turn it to John for a second, so we can talk a little bit because -- about some of our head count growth was in OPEX in the effort to drive some efficiency within the Marsh operation. And it's in its early stages but there was a pretty significant increase in headcount in that area. So, John you want to talk about that a second. 
John Q. Doyle: Sure Dan. We have the largest ever organic hiring in our history this year and we're quite excited about it. Dan touched on the market facing talent that we brought in a bit earlier. I will say it starts with the team, we began the year with -- our teams are deeper and strong as it's ever been. We worked really hard to come together with the team at JLT. We worked on purpose and culture and our colleagues are highly engaged and focused. But one of the things we are working on has been investing aggressively in our client service operations as well. We have a broad program called OPEX, short for operational excellence to improve efficiency, to improve client service outcomes but also to increase the capacity of our market facing colleagues as well. So a fair amount of hiring came in service centers around the world and of course it is not just talent, we're supporting that talent with investments in technologies. We try to automate more and more of our processes. 
Dan Glaser: Thanks John. Next question please. 
Operator: And we have a follow-up question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. 
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks for taking me back. 
Dan Glaser: Welcome back Elyse. 
Elyse Greenspan: You guys reported 10% organic growth so far this year, we'll see how the Q4 shakes out. So put you within the range of double-digit for the year. Typically, you guys talked to a 3% to 5% view. Obviously we've been better this year to have all this hiring that seems like it'll be incremental to revenue next year as well. So could you give us an initial view, I know you guys typically wait till the fourth quarter, but just some initial thoughts that you could share with us when we think about the organic growth outlook for 2022?
Dan Glaser: Sure, sure. And I'll just start with the idea that fourth quarter the top line becomes a little bit more challenging, right. Because Marsh grew 4% in the fourth quarter of last year, Carpenter grew 5%, OW grew 4%, and Mercer was down 3%. So across the piece, a little bit tougher, but we've got good momentum in the business, and we feel good about this year. We also feel good about next year, and the year after. I mean, we have been fundamentally improving the company over the last decade. We are getting stronger on our capabilities, our geographic breadth, our ability to serve. I mean, all of those areas have really dramatically improved and we believe we are in fundamental growth markets, I mean the areas of risk, strategy, and people. I don't care what organization you are and what size, whether you're a large account or a midsize account, you have to address those on a strategic basis. And it is incredibly relevant to the C suite of those companies and organizations to address broadly risk strategy and people. And I think we have enduring competitive advantages as well. I mean, as we were talking before, nothing happens here without our colleagues. I mean, the quality of our organization, the talents that we have, the culture that we have, the broad capabilities, the global footprint, are all enduring competitive advantages. We also continue to acquire talent in the market and acquire businesses which improve us and improve our capabilities. In particular, in middle market, on the brokerage side.  So, there's a lot of growth opportunities, and then just to touch as well on expansion opportunities, I mean we're still weighted into upper middle market and large account, we've gotten better in the mid middle market, we're going to continue to get better, we're going to continue to broaden into the lower middle market and small commercial consumer. You'll see us in all of those areas in the future. Now, it's not going to be from one year to the next, seeing some just massive change but this is inevitable in terms of how we build out our business. We're leveraging the combined strength of our organization as one enterprise like never before, in areas of healthy societies, cyber protection gaps, climate. I mean all of those areas we were going to market and addressing our client’s issues with them on a broad basis, not on a narrow basis. And so our opportunities for revenue growth, in my view are significant. I won't give you a number right now for 2022 but, I think that having not only broken out of the 3% to 5%, but actually tremendously exceeded the 5% level. I think this company can be a real growth firm and that we will prove that over time. We like to do and then say rather than the opposite, so I think it'll be exciting times at Marsh & McLennan. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. 
David Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I just had a question on the headcount adds and so I just -- looking back you added 500 of new headcount in the fourth quarter of 2020 and then 2000 in the first half of 2021. I'm just wondering, did that have any impact on the organic growth this quarter at all or is that still on the come?
Dan Glaser: Yeah, it's negligible. We are seeing some revenue benefit from hiring that we've done at the end of last year and into this year. But most of it's on the comp. So tends to be -- you get the expenses right away and you get the revenue a bit later.
David Motemaden: Got it, thanks. And just to follow-up on that last point, Dan. Just on -- it's sounds like really big hiring quarter this quarter, 3000 new headcount, if I sort of take the 5000, that you said you've hired year-to-date, is there any rule of thumb just to think about or maybe any sort of number you can give me and just how much that weighed on the operating margins in this quarter specifically?
Dan Glaser: Yeah, I'm not going to get into the expense that we're bearing now as a result. I think the -- one of the reasons that we have been pressing on hiring is twofold. One, we are growing very well on the top line and that was our anticipation, and also market opportunity. And so we are in our view an employer of choice in this space, and we are pressing our advantage at this moment in time. The hiring spurt is not going to last forever, but ultimately we saw an opportunity in the market through dislocation and other factors and we really pressed on that level. At the end, our expenses are relatively high compared to historical type of expense growth for us, but our expense growth is essentially driven by sales compensated -- by compensation and benefit but it's very hard sales compensation due to much higher levels of new business, variable compensation due to much higher levels of profitability and hiring. So comp and ben is driving most of our sales, most of our expense growth in the quarter and will ease itself out. But it's matching well with current levels of revenue growth. So we feel that this was a tremendously opportune time to build capabilities within the firm on an organic basis.
David Motemaden: Got it, great, makes sense. Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Great, thanks. Two quick questions. We saw sort of a bit of a fall-off in organic revenue growth in EMEA and an acceleration in Latin America. And I was hoping you could talk about what's going on in those individual markets?
Dan Glaser: Sure Meyer, John do you want take that. 
John Q. Doyle: Hey Meyer, it is really nothing all that extraordinary that happened in any of the region. Quarter-to-quarter, obviously, you can see some variation. We did have a bit of non-recurring issues and tougher comps in EMEA in the quarter, but they weren't material either. I am pleased with the growth in both regions and I expect us to continue to perform in both territories going forward. 
Meyer Shields: Okay, thanks. And then more broadly, obviously, the organic growth is phenomenal. I'm wondering, is there any element of the growth that is specific to like a post pandemic era that wouldn't recur?
Dan Glaser: It's a good question. We're going to find out over time. I think the one issue to just bear in mind is the awareness around issues is higher. And I say that because risk awareness is far higher, I think people awareness is far higher. There's whole categories of opportunity in the world for us and others in areas such as ESG, which was not, which is always considered by companies and organizations, but not nearly to the extent it is today. And so when you think about just what's going on in the world, with regard to climate or D&I, responsible investing, etc., these are all new areas of growth for us. You think about things like climate, which was probably not even considered by us 10 years ago and we think it is one of our major growth opportunities as a firm on a going forward basis. And so, I would just say we want to be a leader on ESG and we look at the addressable market in ESG as being enormous and right now it's kind of the developed world public companies. It's going to be all companies everywhere. And so from that standpoint, the addressable market is going to be quite large and we will be a significant player in it.
Meyer Shields: Okay, thank you very much. 
Dan Glaser: Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Wolfe Research. 
Michael Zaremski: Hey great, good morning. I guess a follow-up to Meyer’s question and maybe Elyse's, too. So, you're talking about -- you've been talking a while about broadening Marsh's capabilities, new categories which are exciting, I'm just curious if this kind of changes your views on M&A into new areas or technologies over time, or is it really just kind of what we should be thinking about this kind of same sandboxes -- M&A sandboxes you're in currently?
Dan Glaser: You know, our M&A sandbox is very broad, and maybe our M&A that we've actually executed on is narrower than what we actually look at. But the sandbox is quite broad and I think you'd be surprised at some of the adjacencies and areas we look at. I mean, we -- I think, as I was mentioning earlier, the areas of risk strategy and people have all kinds of elements to them, that would enable us to continue to build capabilities with acquiring firms. We like firms that have recurring revenue, we like firms that are advisory based with transactions. Doesn't mean that all of our acquisitions will fit that criteria but that's a lot of them. And then we also like firms where we can see the business benefit, the financial benefit to us even if it's a bit out there, we can see it. And some of the things we look at, frankly, and the amount of liquidity and money that's being generated in the world and available, we just look at it and say we can’t -- we like the company, and it's interesting, but boy, we don't have 30 years to figure out whether it worked or not. And so we're a disciplined acquirer and we want to acquire things that not only build our capabilities, but also help us financially as well, even if only on an incremental basis. So, I would say we have a very broad sandbox, but our level of execution has been relatively narrow over the last 5 or 10 years and that probably continues on that basis. We look at a lot of things and we execute on things that we're really committed to.
Michael Zaremski: Okay, great. I guess my follow-up and not to harp on it too much but -- because excellent -- your results were excellent. But, it sounds like you're saying that some of the margins were impacted by new hires. Is that the main influence, are there other items we should be thinking about? And I guess, just hiring spurt should be expected to continue in the near term and so we should be kind of thinking about that as we project margins and then maybe, I guess, when hiring slows, you have maybe easier comps in outer years?
Dan Glaser: Yeah, I mean, first of all, I wouldn't fret about the margins in the quarter. Ultimately, we've said many times, you have to look about margin expansion over longer stretches of time. We have improved our margins for 14 consecutive years and the results are really remarkable from a basis point improvement. Our margin is up 120 bps year-to-date and that's on top of 120 bps in 2020, and 110 bps in 2019. So it another role in our margins and I would expect that our margins next year are going to be better than they are this year, and so that's the way we operate the business, but it's an outcome. Now, we don't sit around the table figuring out how we're going to drive margin, what we do is we figure out how we're going to drive the underlying growth and earnings. That's the focus of the firm and the outcome of margin expansion is how we run the firm, where we think not every quarter but certainly every year revenue growth needs to exceed expense growth. And that's what we do and we've done it consistently. And so, we're thrilled about where we are. What I mentioned earlier is that, a lot of the expense growth right now is being driven by compensation around sales, and around increased profitability. And so I got really good place to be in and our earnings growth is very strong, remarkably strong. And so I hope that answers your question. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. 
Brian Meredith: Hey, thanks. Couple questions. First, just curious, free cash flow down year-over-year, is that simply just due to the hires that you're having right now and should we expect to see free cash flow, let's start some good growth with earnings here, production 2022? 
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Brian. I am going to hand it off to Mark for that. 
Mark McGivney: Thank you, Brian. Actually, we're really happy with free cash flow. Year-to-date, I think you have to be careful. There's a lot that can happen and cause volatility in a quarter with the cash flow statement even across the year. But free cash flow growth for us has been a great story over a long period of time and you go back over a decade. We've generated double-digit growth in free cash flow and we're up -- if you look year-to-date this year, we are up 5% and that's on top of 56% growth in free cash flow last year. So I think any growth above a big stair up last year is pretty good. So I think overall, our cash generation this year is strong and that's what's enabling us to deploy so much capital. 
Brian Meredith: Great. It's really helpful. And then second question, Dan more just a broad based question here, inflation has been obviously a hot topic, just across the markets. Just give us your perspective on kind of what's going on with inflation right now and particularly as it relates to some of the kind of commercial lines, insurance market, are you seeing any inflationary pressures when you started handle claims for clients and stuff or not at this point?
Dan Glaser: Yeah. Why don't I take that and then I'll hand to John and Martine to just say, are you seeing inflation in any way in the conversations with clients and what we're hearing from markets. I mean, historically we've done some work and we tend to do as a company better in inflationary periods. I mean, elements of our revenue base react to inflation, such as higher insured values, and we've proven that we can manage our expense base and so sometimes the revenue runs a little bit because of inflation, and we're still managing our expense base. So when we've looked back to inflationary periods over the last 25 years, we've tended to outperform and do pretty well. And, overall, I'll just mention on the economic environment, not just inflation. I mean, there's a lot of positive features about the economic environment, particularly in the United States. I mean, sales are up, consumer spending is up, business confidence is positive. But there are a lot of potential risks and inflation is probably the biggest one of them. But you also have the supply chain issues that we've all been reading about, the return to office that we're all going to be navigating over the coming months, concerns around COVID variants, so it is a tremendously difficult time to look forward, say, four quarters or so and get a real bead on what the economic performance is. Although I do note that most GDP forecast for next year in that kind of 4% and 5% range, so not bad. But starting with John, what are you hearing from markets and clients around inflation, and then we'll go to Martine. 
John Q. Doyle: I am certainly hearing concerns on multiple levels, maybe I'll start just on the claim side for a second. And Peter mentioned earlier that more than $100 billion were the cat losses. Of course, we're typically accustomed to demand surge related kind of temporary inflation, if you will, around cat losses. But it's further, those issues are further exacerbated by the supply chain challenges that we're seeing in markets. So there's some level of concern there in terms of what it'll mean, ultimately, the lost costs around cats. I mentioned earlier, the impact of social inflation around liability claims and particularly here in the United States and a couple of other jurisdictions as courts reopen after the pandemic, and we're seeing some evidence of that, although broad based evidences is really yet to show itself. Of course, payrolls and employment levels are important from a demand perspective around commercial insurance and work comp in particular. And so there is concern about wage inflation from some of our clients and the impact on growing costs there. And maybe with that, you -- I will hand it to Martine to talk maybe more about the benefits side of the business.
Martine Ferland: Yeah, thanks John and indeed, wage inflation and inflation in general usually we do well in these times; one, because our clients really need help in managing these increased costs. So, how do they manage through medical inflation, which we believe is coming back now that regular care will resume which is intended to keep premium a bit low during COVID. The same thing on wage inflation looking at federating transformation program with clients to address the pyramid and the profiles of their workforce. And in terms of pension plans as well, I mean we have to watch on that. And as soon as there's pressures in the economy and system, governance spike up in terms of helping clients manage the asset side of their pension funds more tightly and therefore, that's usually good for the OCIO business in our investment management solutions. And lastly, from a management of our business, most if not all of our multi-year assignments would have a dramatic adjustment to inflation so we've seen that movie before, some years ago.
Brian Meredith: Thank you. 
Dan Glaser: Thank you. Appreciate it. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.
Michael Phillips: Thanks, good morning. First question on -- have you seen as a higher level any impact of tax reform on M&A activities at industry level, either it's changing the timing of it, of M&A or deals pay the multiples paid, any impact there at all?
Dan Glaser: Yeah, there's been in -- there's a lot of deals out there but that has been pretty consistent over the last several years. And whether there is some marginal impact of people trying to get ahead of whatever could happen in the U.S. tax environment, it would be on the edges. It's not driving like a more significant level than what we have seen. There's been a lot of sellers out there. I think there's a lot of sellers out there, mainly because there's a lot of capital out there, valuations are pretty strong, that is probably the biggest factor as to what's driving M&A activity.
Michael Phillips: Okay, thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on the last couple comments on inflation. You talked a lot about, a lot of questions on hiring and possible impacts on your margins there. But I guess specifically to you guys on wage inflation, any impacts there, you have seen and you felt and current margin where you expect to impact that in your margins, pretty specifically?
Dan Glaser: Yeah, I'll hand off to Martine and then to Nick to just talk about whether they're seeing in the client base and in fact, in our own firm any pressures around wage inflation. We're watching it very closely, obviously. You know, we're all reading about inflation in general and also in the dynamic between employers and employees, across many industries. The employees seem to be in charge right now and so I think that not only wages and benefits, but more broadly, environment of how companies operate, the attractiveness of their work environment, etc., are key factors in terms of the ability to retain people and the ability to attract high quality people. But why don't we start with Martine and see what you're seeing and then we'll go to Nick? 
Martine Ferland: Yeah, from a wage inflation point of view in the market, what we're seeing is that there's more pressure at the lower end of the wage spectrum, where there's a lot of movement there to attract people to jobs, that have been really hard hit during the pandemic. At the higher end of white collar professional, what we're seeing is a little bit of a musical chair, I would say. So there's a great resignation, there's quite a people have moved, people are looking for different careers. And we need to help our clients manage through these pressures and demand. But I think this element of it will be temporary and will settle itself over time. I mean, as clients look at -- as I said earlier, transforming, focusing on the skills they need rather than jobs and roles, we see a very important trend there. Dan has spoken earlier about our Skills-Edge platform that helped client migrate to that. These are all techniques that will help clients get through this change that we're seeing right now.
Dan Glaser: So let me hand over to Nick with a bit of a shout out for Oliver Wyman, because two quarters in a row of 20% plus organic growth, not bad, not bad, and I'm looking forward to finalizing the budget conversation with you later on today. Nick are you seeing some wage inflations, are you hearing it from clients as well?
Nick Studer: Yeah, thanks Dan. Thank you, Michael for the question as well. I think I agree with the way that Dan and Martine have both characterized this overall. In our businesses it is a competitive market for talent. I think we fit in our clients, I think we particularly see it in our business. And there have been a couple of times when with our strong growth, capacity constraints have constrained our ability a little bit. I am not enormously worried by it. We are finding it -- we are hiring more than we hired, I think, maybe ever before but certainly over the last five years. I'm hiring extremely rapidly. But we see some of the musical chairs which Martine described across our businesses too. So in short, yes, there is a period of employee power and rising wages.
Dan Glaser: Thank you. I think we have time for another question or two. But next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.
Ryan Tunis: Hey thanks. Good morning. Dan, I just had one. How do you think about the growth dynamics of the talent pool in the industry as a whole whether it's a consulting you do or PNC brokerage, I guess I ask because we know there is some areas of brokerage, I guess it's more in the personal line side where there's kind of secular talent outflow, I'm just trying to get a sense…?
Dan Glaser: No, it is a very good question. We see no, Ryan it is a great question but we see no problem with our ability to attract talent. In fact, when we hire 5000 people, you have to understand we are interviewing 25,000 to 30,000 interviews taking place. We are very selective on how we approach talent. Every time we're seeking talent we have numerous applicants. And so I think, at the very heart of it is the work that we do. We're not an insurance business, we're a risk business. We're not a people business, from an administrative standpoint, we're a strategic people business. And so from that standpoint, the purpose of the organization of making a difference for companies, in their moments that matter, and those inflection points I think it is very attractive. And so where we're able to compete with the best firms in the world for high levels of talent, and when you have the broad base that we have, you can take some risks around, okay, so that person is not a subject matter expert, but boy, they've got a history of success. And let's see how they do. And so we can go a little bit broader. So we see none of the constraints that some folks particularly in the insurance industry have in terms of inflow of talent.
Ryan Tunis: Thank you.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-22 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan's Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Second quarter 2021 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements, including certain expectations related to COVID-19 and other matters. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements.
Dan Glaser: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer, of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. I'd like to welcome Nick who became CEO of Oliver Wyman, July 1. Nick has led many of Oliver Wyman’s major practices in his 23 years with the business and look forward to seeing Oliver Wyman continue to grow and thrive under his leadership. On behalf of the Executive Committee, I also want to thank Scott McDonald for his many contributions during his distinguished  career at the firm. Marsh & McLennan had an outstanding second quarter.  We have a well-positioned and benefiting from an abundance of opportunities. We are stronger and have broader capabilities .  benefiting from what may be the strongest economic rebound, nearly four decades led by our largest region, the U.S. There is high demand for our advice and solutions in this time of uncertainty and in the face of challenging market conditions.  We are seeing a  to quality and stability, which is contributing to high levels of business growth and client retention. And it's helping us attract talent. And there's a long runway for growth as we think about major protection gaps around the world, new emerging risks, digitization, workforce of the future and under penetrated market such as small commercial. We are focused on capitalizing on these opportunities and I am proud of our execution in the quarter. We generated record second quarter revenue and earnings, the best underlying growth of any quarter in two decades  for an excellent year. The strength of our results was brought based with each of our businesses and virtually all of our major geographies, seeing an acceleration in growth. Our adjusted EPS increased by an impressive 33% and we generated margin expansion despite challenging expense comparisons.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, Dan and good morning. Our results were excellent with record second quarter revenue earnings, the best quarterly underlying growth in two decades, meaningful margin expansion and significant growth in adjusted earnings. Highlights from our second quarter performance included the strongest underlying  since the first quarter of 2003, the strongest in Guy Carpenter in 15 years, solid rebound of 6% at Mercer, and record reported underlying growth in Oliver Wyman. Second quarter growth and adjusted earnings per share was also impressive, rising at the fastest pace of any quarter more than a decade. Consolidated revenue increased 20% in the second quarter to 5 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 13%. Operating income in the quarter was 1.2 billion, an increase of 39% over the prior year. Adjusted operating income increased 24% to 1.2 billion, and our adjusted operating margin increased  to 26.4%.
Dan Glaser: Thanks Mark, and operator we are ready to begin Q&A.
Operator:  Our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the organic growth outlook, recognizing the comps do get a little bit harder in the second half of the year, but, you know, the Q3 was still negative last year. So, I guess my question is, given what you know now, sounds like you guys are positive, but a little bit cautious about the economy. You know, is it possible, it sounds like it's still possible, we could see double-digit organic growth over the remaining two quarters of the year?
Dan Glaser: So, we obviously, as Mark was saying, we've got momentum, and we feel very good about how we're positioned, and we're not that fearful about the economy. We are fearful about continuing waves of COVID, but, you know, the economies have adjusted somewhat in many parts of the world and are more resilient certainly than they were in the spring of 2020. And so the impact, economic impact won't be as severe as what we've seen, even with continuing waves of COVID. I mean, last quarter Elyse, we said that 2021 growth would be at the high-end of our 3% to 5% range and possibly higher. I think at 9% underlying growth through six months, it's safe to say that we're in the higher category. You know, we feel very good about our position. We're going to have a very good year. And 2021 is just going to set a new base for us. We intend to grow revenues and earnings in 2022 as well. So, this is not going to be a one-year wonder.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, that's helpful. And then my second question was on the margin side. So, you guys, you know, Dan, I think you both said that, you know, some T&E has not fully come back, but also, you know, the pretty impressive revenue growth helped drive that margin improvement as well. So, we think about the back half of the year and T&E coming back, can you just help us think through, you know, the resulting impact on the margins, especially if revenue remains strong, maybe the second half could also see some margin improvement?
Dan Glaser: Well, I'll start by saying that we absolutely expect margin expansion in the year, and this will be our 14th consecutive year of margin expansion. Margins are an outcome of how we run the business. I mean, we grow our revenue every year at a pace that's faster than how we grow our expenses. I think you may be overly optimistic about T&E really roaring back in the back half of this year. I think it's going to be very gradual, and slow, actually. And I think that companies, not just Marsh & McLennan will travel with more purpose and will be more thoughtful about traveling. And I think clients will expect the same of providers like ours.  And so, you know, we do expect and hope that over time, you know, T&E gets back to, kind of 2019 levels, but we may be quite a way away from that point-in-time. You know, we were very pleased with our margin expansion in the quarter. And as you said, that was driven by our top line like that's where it largely came from. And it helped us – that strong top line helped us overcome a comparable, which was a minus 5% expense . I mean, look at look at our –  are up 30 bips, but that's on top of 430 bips margin expansion in the second quarter of last year. So, we like where we are. We will grow margins for the year. It may not be every quarter, don't know that right now, but ultimately we feel good for the year. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So, just on organic growth, again, obviously you mentioned easy comps, were there any other tailwinds, such as maybe pent-up demand in certain industries or just the benefit of higher price hikes in PNC that might not repeat to the same extent in future periods?
Dan Glaser: Yeah. The high levels of growth were not just because of easy comps at all. I mean, Guy Carpenter’s comp was a 9 last year, you know, March was a 1. So, it was not exactly layoffs in terms of comps. I think that the real momentum right now, and the U.S. economy is getting stronger,  is well behind us and the combined organization is emerging from the pandemic stronger than what we went in and focus on our front foot. New business generation was terrific across the businesses. And our growth was broad based. Retention is strong, pricing is a tailwind, and we're benefiting from disruption and flight to quality and stability. So, there are a lot of factors that are that are underpinning our revenue growth, and we feel very good about revenue growth into the future.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on share buybacks, I think you spent over 300 million in 2Q over 400 for the first half. And that's a higher pace than you typically did prior to the pandemic. So, is it more of a catch up from not buying back stock last year or is – should we assume this is going to be more of a run rate going forward?
Dan Glaser: We're not catching up with , every year is its own adventure. And ultimately, as we've said before, we start every period believing in a balanced approach to capital management, not that we'll spend the same money in each of our three principal buckets of dividend, and acquisition and share repurchase, but we don't have an approach that waited to one versus the other. And so share purchase in large part is a function of what our acquisition activity looks like, you know, every year might not be perfectly balanced, but the first half was pretty balanced.  I mean, our uses of 478 million of dividends, 434 of share repurchases, and 473 of acquisition. So, it is a balanced approach and I think you’ll see that from us. I mean, at the end, as Mark was saying, we have 3.5 billion or more to deploy. We are a cash generation type of company. So, this is again, not a one-year wonder. This is an every year, we're going to put money toward our dividend. We're going to grow our dividend. We're going to acquire high quality firms and we're going to buy back our own shares. I mean that's going to be year-after-year.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay, thank you.
Dan Glaser: Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
David Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit more about the expenses. Just the other operating expenses were up, you know, not as much as I would have thought. I mean, it sounds like T&E continues to be a benefit. That's not going to roar back, but still up only 6% year-over-year, despite a pretty favorable or pretty tough comp on the expense side. I'm wondering if there was anything else one off in there? And relatedly, I guess, you know, are you guys realizing more sustainable expense saves as a result of some of the operational changes due to COVID-19? Like, you know, real estate expense saves, and that sort of thing?
Dan Glaser: It's a good question, David. And we certainly are going to realize a number of efficiency gains over the next several years. And that's just, as you mentioned real estate more purposeful, T&E or traveling in general and hopefully  as well. Also, you know, we've been undergoing some significant modernization projects on technology and on operations, and so that – that will benefit us more in the future than it's doing right now. The biggest growth in our expenses frankly is compensation. And I think that's a good thing is, our variable cost is going up along with our growth.  We're in the market, we're hiring. I mean, the first six months of this year, our headcount has grown nearly 2000. Most of that is coming within Marsh, as they're capitalizing on the opportunity they see with their two biggest competitors having some element of distraction and uncertainty. So, you know, at the end, it's more expense related to headcount and expense related to compensation that's where the growth of expense is coming from. And we feel pretty good about that, you know, we can manage that over time. But we’re in the market right now. You know, building our business and building on already the industry leading pool of talent we already have.
David Motemaden: Great. Yeah, that's good to hear. I guess maybe just a follow up on that headcount. I mean, I think, you know, that's the 2,000 headcount growth this year is definitely more than I was thinking where I had thought, how much of a – how much of a tail does that have? Like, you know, is that something that you think can continue through the end of the year or is, you know, is that something that, you know, you have like this, you know, period of time where the consolidation is, sort of in, there's some uncertainty there, and you guys are capitalizing on that? And then once that's over, it's, you know, sort of back to normal course, where you guys are still getting talent, it's just not as significant.
Dan Glaser : I think talent begets talent. You know, people are attracted to work in environments with smart, creative, dedicated people. And the more people like that you have the more talent you attract. It's clear that the issues of Willis in particular, in Aon, are creating a short-term opportunity that will run its course one way or the other. I mean, I was just looking at the stats recently are hiring from Aon and Willis post, the announcement is three times higher on a net basis than it was in the 16 months prior to the announcement. So that's not going to run forever, but ultimately, we're doing our best to continue to build  and capabilities within our already formidable firm. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. So, two questions I think related to what you were talking about. First, when you talk about the flight to stability, was that a headwind or a tailwind to margins in the quarter?
Dan Glaser : I think the flight to stability indicates that our account protection levels in our new business are higher than they otherwise would be. So, that would be a benefit in not only revenue, but a benefit to margins because the revenue is higher than it would otherwise be. It's not having an impact on expense.
Meyer Shields: Okay, perfect. And then obviously, the reinsurance, organic growth has been fantastic for a long-time. There are, you know, it seems like there are a lot of new companies out there. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on what's happening in the competitive environment?
Dan Glaser: You know, we're very pleased with Guy Carpenter’s performance over a number of years, but I'll hand off to Peter so we can dig in a little bit deeper. So, Peter, you want to take that?
Peter Hearn: Yeah. Thanks, Dan. Thanks, Meyer. We have, we've enjoyed a terrific run over the past several years. Our model is, you know, based on consistent growth over a long period of time, and we're able to capitalize on that model, as a result of a very compelling proposition. Disciplined around both sales and pipeline that have resulted in new business wins, and as we look at our new business wins, over the past several quarters Meyer, the amount of new business coming from new clients, has grown significantly, to the extent that in Q2 2021, that number was 56% of our revenue growth from new business came from new clients. So, you know, we're seeing continued growth based on the model that we built. Yes, there are a number of new challenger brokers out there, and we have to be mindful, you know, all of our competitors are worthy adversaries. But we believe we have a very compelling proposition that over a long period of time has produced sustained growth and opportunity for us on a continuing basis.
Meyer Shields: Okay, fantastic. Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Alright, thanks Meyer. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.
Brian Meredith: Yeah, thanks. Two quick ones here. First one, Dan, I'm wondering if you could break down at Marsh? Just generally speaking, what the impact in organic revenue growth was from rate versus call exposure growth versus market share gains, just generally speaking?
Dan Glaser: If you can speak up just a little bit more? I got the question, but it was a little faint. I'll hand over to John, but, you know, I’ll just start by saying how thrilled we all are with – in our 150th year anniversary at the company. We could grow the GAAP top line by 20%. In Marsh in particular,  best growth in a couple of decades. This is a phenomenal overall performance. But John, you want to break down the growth a bit?
John Doyle: Sure. Brian, thanks for the question. As Dan and Mark both mentioned, we certainly benefited from the economic rebound, relatively soft prior year , proud of that growth in the second quarter last year during the . The pricing environment, Dan talked about it a little bit in his remarks earlier, about 50% of our revenue is sensitive to PNC pricing. While rate increases have come down modestly, compared to the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, they held really where we're sensitive to pricings, where we get commission, but it's from a number of different areas. But I also want to emphasize that we executed really well in the quarter.  Our team is even as strong as it's ever been. They're highly engaged, focused on delivering for our clients. And the market remains challenging. It's, you know, again, while rates aren't nearly as much as they were before, they are quite difficult. I do think, you know, there's been a bit of catch up. You know, in some markets, there's a fair amount of new business. In our results, so whether it's in transaction risk in cyber or in construction, there are examples of where that is the case. But again, we're very pleased with the results in the quarter.
Dan Glaser: Anything else, Brian?
Brian Meredith: Great. That's great. Thanks. And then the second question is, Dan can you talk a little bit about, kind of the M&A environment here, kind of what it looks like right now and also have the issues that Aon and Willis have kind of run into with some regulatory approvals, has that at all changed your kind of strategic view of M&A right now?
Dan Glaser: No. It had no impact. Our philosophy in M&A is basically we like buying firms that are high quality with a leadership team generally remains in place, and recurring revenue streams, high cash generation, low capital requirements, and a history of success that sets it up for us, and then it’s really getting to know each other over a long stretch of time and figuring out, it's not us buying, and it's not them selling, we're deciding to come together. We believe the outcome for our clients and our people will be better together than separate. And that's the approach. Pipeline remains strong for us, throughout our businesses.  In fact, you know, last year was the highest acquired revenue within Marsh & McLennan agency, which as you know, has been more than a decade long, in terms of strategy building. So, we feel very good about that. I mean, obviously, there's a lot of capital in the world. So, you know, multiples are higher than what we would like. And we need to be very selective and very careful in our evaluation of pro forma results, because most of the companies we've looked at are private. But our strategy for a long period of time has been more of a string of pearls, not something where it is one mega type of acquisition, but it's building the company's capabilities.  Geographic have, you know,  JLT was an anomaly in some ways and it was perhaps our biggest acquisition in history. And  that acquisition, because we have been cultivating a broad relationship, for a long period of time. We were coming together, because we thought the combination was going to be better for clients, and you're seeing a manifestation of that. Growth is better, because of our combination with JLT, particularly in our specialty operation. And so, you know, that's, kind of where we are. Our thoughts on M&A have not changed.
Brian Meredith: Great. Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.
Ryan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess, just thinking about consulting, a couple of things. First of all, with Oliver Wyman, the 28 organic, just any color on I guess how you're thinking about that, any visibility on, sort of the back half of the year? And I guess, just within Mercer, it sounds it has been some focus on the call about comps becoming more difficult, is that obvious that the comps get that much more challenging there. So, I'm – maybe curious if you Martine could give us some perspective on, you know, sort of how business developed in the three months of the quarter and where we're at now, looking at the back half?
Dan Glaser: I’m glad Ryan that you have, sort of consulted. It is a big part of our business and a big part of our performance, you know, and I'll hand it off to Nick first and then over to Martine, but let me just say a couple of comments first. One, we've mentioned before, that Oliver Wyman will tend to be our fastest grower over long stretches of time, but with more volatility. And so yeah, look back to the second quarter of last year minus 13. So, we love , but ultimately you put them together, and it's 6% over one of the more difficult periods in recent human history.  And so yeah, we tick the box on that. And that's a terrific result. Mercer on the other hand, Mercer is in terrific growth businesses, health, wealth, career, and you know, Martine does some great underpinning work. And if you go back to the end of 2019, you know 2% growth, 3% growth, and 4% growth in sequential quarters, and then 5% growth in the first quarter of 2020. And then got  the pandemic as expected in some ways, and held up very well with a minus 3 throughout last year. So, Martine and Mercer are going back to, you know, a terrific result in the second quarter. It is sort of getting back to the same pace or getting back to the same processes that existed pre-pandemic. Let's start with Nick, and then we'll go to Martine. Nick?
Nick Studer: Thank you very much. Yes, as Dan said, we're thrilled with the performance. And as to where it's coming from, it's in an incredibly broad base. The growth in the quarter was highest in the regions and the sectors, which have been most adversely affected by the pandemic and then referred to the comp. The Americas, particularly the U.S. have seen a very sharp rebound in client demand, both through the economic conditions and business confidence rising materially, and if you take, for example, the transportation sector, which was the sector that suffered the greatest impact from the pandemic last year, springing back very strongly.  While a lot of outsides of the Americas growth in Europe and in the Asia Pacific region were also quite robust. And across all major industry groups financial services, consumer industrial healthcare, all actually going remarkably at similar rates. And you know what we do think the outsized growth in Q2 was an outlier, we see business confidence remaining high, as global economic conditions improve, and we see even some semblance of return to normality in some of the places we operate. And it is also applied this in the labor market for the skill set that our consoles possess. So, we have a decent outlook for the business for the rest of the year.
Dan Glaser: Thanks Nick. Martine?
Martine Ferland: Thanks for asking the question. Similar to Oliver Wyman the growth in the quarter really came all along the business and of the regions. But I think it's worth spending a moment  we have said through the pandemic, that this is where we have the most discretionary projects a little bit more connected to our Oliver Wyman would be operating. And it's absolutely come back. Times have restarted projects. There's a lot of demand out there. We’ve been helping clients with their post pandemic workforce. There was a war for talent out there.  So, demand for rewards, demands for skills, and skill sets, assessment, engagement, transformation, as companies accelerate their  to digital and newer technology. So that is sustaining our  business. We see strong sales, good momentum for the rest of the year. And I want to spend another moment on our wealth business, I think 4% growth in the quarter is, we have not seen that since Q4 2017. Again, all  in our wealth business did well.  In particular, our OCIO business, which is the part of the business where we implement asset management for our clients. And you see the flight to strong governance there, deep manager research, and combined with questions and helping clients with ESG and , the type of investment in modeling and the life balance  comments a little bit. And lastly on wealth, this is the year where the DB cards of our portfolio which you all know is in structural decline, and for some years, actually because same size becomes smaller than investment management solution. And we have in a portfolio than we can see that this should be providing some tailwinds as we go beyond 2021.
Dan Glaser: Thanks Nick, thanks Martine.
Ryan Tunis: Thanks. Got it. And then just a follow-up for Dan and maybe John Doyle as well, can you just, I guess give us an update on the strategic importance of using wholesale brokers on the PNC side and maybe how that's evolved over time?
Dan Glaser: Yeah. I'll take it and hand it over to John. It’s an interesting question. I think wholesale brokers in a lot of ways like the  in that, you know, they become quite specialists in a lot of different areas with some really good skills. Those are exactly what I think back in my career, what wholesale really meant 10 or 20 years ago. I think specialty placement might be more appropriate. But John, you want to talk about use of wholesalers?
John Doyle: Sure. You know,  it's largely focused on specialty capabilities. And the most part we use wholesalers when we need to access certain markets, certain specialty insurance,  in particular, respect their distribution access to certain  brokers. For the most part that happens in the United States, almost no utilization for us. Like I say in the United States, risk kind of originated from the United States. To some extent it happens in the London marketplace as well, but we have a preferred a relationship with a couple of other specialty wholesalers and focus our efforts making sure we're delivering the same quality outcome for our clients that we came back from utilizing our own teams.
Dan Glaser: Next question please.
Operator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Paul Newsome: Good morning, and congrats on the quarter. My question is about the potential persistency of some of these market share gains. I'm thinking about back to the JLT acquisition and it seemed to me there was a little bit of drag on organic growth for about a year as things sort of moved through the system and the integration happened. Do you think there's a read through to, kind of what's happening for you on a positive sense today that as you hire these new people, it really takes, kind of a year for the full revenue impact and so that's kind of how we should think about the benefit of the flight to quality? It’s kind of a year-by-year kind of effect?
Dan Glaser : Yeah, I would start Paul by saying, you know, we're an awfully big company. So, we make decisions to add to our talent, capability, and our broad capabilities, more generally, to build skill, content, etcetera. As opposed to necessarily saying, oh, that person is going to cost us this amount and we expect them to produce this amount over the course of the next couple of years. Your basic premise that will be to hire senior people that generally you expense first and then some revenue might come later.  Yeah, if the premise is true, as they get involved with the firm more broadly, but unlike some of the  firms, it's not just focused on, you know, this is a producer, this is what they think their book of businesses and you know, and we are buying, you know, that produce, that's just not how we operate. We're much more of a content culture building capabilities. But John what are your thoughts on that?
John Doyle: The market shares is a hard thing to measure. I've read some estimates of personal insurance premiums will grow about 10% this year. So, if you use that as a proxy for the market then, you know then, yes, we cannot share. You know, I mentioned earlier, we're picking up some new business, you know  construction, primarily. Our win rates are up  when I look at the success in RFPs, it's up compared to historical levels, and the number of offensive RFPs, defensive RFPs is considerably better, which it's been passed. All I think speaks to the quality of the time. And at the same time, we're investing in talent that's going to drive the future growth. So, we’re , we have good momentum, and we're excited about what that means for us .
Dan Glaser : Anything else, Paul?
Paul Newsome: Yeah, just a little bit more on the market share, it looks like it came everywhere in terms of gains, in your businesses, is that really a fair sense? Or were there some benefits 0 business that you ?
Dan Glaser: This is the  of business growth that we've seen, certainly, since I've been at the company. And so it is occurring in many different spots. And I would put it down to that one of our fundamental growth market, risk strategy and people, you know, companies whether you're in a large account segment, the middle market segment, as a small segment, if you work for an organization or government, you have to focus on those three things. They're completely relevant to how you approach the business. We've got competitive advantages that starts with the quality of our people, our culture. Large capabilities that got even further gone in through the acquisitions we've done over the last number of years, most notably JLT. And our global footprint, those are competitive advantages.  We don't have a lot of competitors in any way that can match up to those advantages. And we continue to acquire best-in-class businesses. Our number one focus is on quality, and history of success. And so that's particularly in middle market brokerage. And we've got all kinds of opportunities. We spoke about cyber, and climate in our scripts, for digital, small commercial, you know, risk awareness in general is much higher. And so, you know, we're – as I've mentioned before, the pandemic maybe brought us closer than we ever were before. We're more connected. We're more collaborative than ever before. And we're leveraging our combined strengths like never before. So, all of those factors come together and we are a more formidable force in the market. And we're going to win business. And you know, that's going to continue.
Paul Newsome: Thank you. That's great.
Dan Glaser: Next question.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan for any closing remarks.
Dan Glaser: Okay. Well, that's a first. Okay, but I appreciate everyone joining us on the call this morning. I want to thank our 70,000 colleagues for their commitment, hard work, and dedication to Marsh & McLennan, and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-27 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan's Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. First quarter 2021 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements, including certain expectations related to COVID-19 and other matters. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh & McLennan website.
Dan Glaser: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh & McLennan had an outstanding start to 2021. Our first quarter results were excellent, and we are well positioned for a very good year. Even though the pandemic is ongoing, our underlying revenue growth of 6% is the highest in over 6 years and accelerated sequentially across every business. We also grew adjusted EPS by 21% and generated significant margin expansion. Our business has proven resilient throughout the pandemic. And with the global economy now beginning to turn the corner, we saw an acceleration in our growth. With 6% underlying growth to begin the year, we now expect full year 2021 underlying revenue growth to be at the high end of our 3% to 5% guidance range and possibly above. As we look ahead, the outlook for the U.S. and many of the countries we operate in is encouraging. However, many parts of the world continue to suffer with high levels of infection, and there is still a significant amount of uncertainty. GDP in the U.S. was close to flat in the first quarter and strong levels of growth are expected, starting in the second quarter, due to a rebound in demand as the impact of vaccines takes hold, along with favorable economic comparisons to a year ago. Meanwhile, in India, Brazil and many other parts of the world, case counts continue to rise and broad levels of vaccination remain a long way off. Our proprietary pandemic navigator now forecasts that the U.S. will achieve the herd immunity threshold by early to mid-summer, and we see a fairly similar time line in the UK. These milestones bring hope for reopening and economic growth, although it will vary by country. We are also mindful that the risk exists and that there still are many unknowns, such as variance of the virus, the efficacy of vaccines on the variants, the duration of immunity and vaccine hesitancy. But we are resilient and are confident we will be able to adapt to a wide range of scenarios, just as we have since the beginning of this crisis.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, Dan, and good morning. Our first quarter results were outstanding, and we are well positioned for a very good 2021 despite the continued uncertainty associated with the pandemic. Underlying growth accelerated across all of our businesses, and our margin expansion and earnings growth were impressive. Consolidated revenue increased 9% in the first quarter to $5.1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 6%. Operating income and adjusted operating income were both approximately $1.4 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 260 basis points to 29.6%, GAAP EPS was $1.91, and adjusted EPS was $1.99, up 21% compared with the first quarter a year ago. Looking at Risk & Insurance Services. First quarter revenue was $3.2 billion, up 11% compared with the year ago or 7% on an underlying basis. This marks the highest level of underlying growth since 2012. Adjusted operating income increased 17% to $1.1 billion, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 36.6%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.3 billion, up 13% compared with a year ago or 8% on an underlying basis. This was Marsh's highest level of underlying growth in nearly 2 decades. Growth in the quarter was broad-based and driven by double-digit new business growth and solid retention and was impressive considering Marsh's strong growth in the first quarter of last year. The U.S. and Canada division delivered another exceptional quarter, with underlying revenue growth of 9%. This is the highest quarterly underlying growth U.S. and Canada has achieved since we began reporting their results, and they have now averaged 6% underlying growth over the last 12 quarters. In international, underlying growth was strong at 6%, marking the highest underlying growth since 2013. EMEA was up 6%, with strong results in each region, including in the UK. Asia Pacific was up 8%, a strong rebound from the fourth quarter and comes on top of 6% growth in the first quarter of 2020. And Latin America grew 6% on an underlying basis, continuing to show sequential improvement. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $895 million, up 8% or 7% on an underlying basis, driven by strong growth in North America, EMEA, Global Specialties and Latin America Treaty. Guy Carpenter has now achieved 5% or higher underlying growth in 12 of the last 14 quarters. In the Consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was $1.9 billion, up 6% from a year ago or 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income was $370 million, and the adjusted operating margin expanded by 330 basis points to 20.5%.
Dan Glaser: Thanks Mark. Operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Mike Zaremski: Hey, great, good morning. First question, thinking about some of your comments about organic growth, so this quarter, clearly, excellent 6%. I believe, Dan, you said that for the full year, you could potentially be over the guide. And you also said you expected Mercer’s organic growth levels to improve in 2Q. So if I understood correctly, then I think it implies that there might be some deceleration in parts of the business in later quarters. So maybe just kind of curious, were there any kind of one-time items in nature or things we should be thinking about in the back half of the year that could show less positive momentum?
Dan Glaser: Sure. So, why don’t I take that to begin with, and then I will hand off to each of our business leaders, so they can talk a little bit about their growth prospects and how they looked at the quarter and what they are looking at going forward. I would just start by saying we have got real momentum right now. I mean the U.S. economy is getting stronger. The JLT integration is well behind us, and the combined organization is emerging from the pandemic strong, focused and on our front foot. New business generation was terrific across the business and in particular, at Marsh and Oliver Wyman. So when Scott and John speak, they can talk to you a little bit about their new business. But overall, retention was strong, growth was broad based. On the RIS side, pricing is a tailwind, and we are benefiting from some disruption in flight to quality. That said, Mike, there is nothing one-off or unusual about our results. So, we are not really going to get into, in coming quarters, do we expect a deceleration. Obviously, as Mark was saying, we start to get some easier comps on the top line and some tougher comps on the expense line, but it will play itself out, and we expect to have a very strong year. But why don’t we start with Marsh, and John to just talk about growth a little bit. John?
John Doyle: Thanks Dan. Mike, as Dan noted, nothing particularly one-off in nature about the growth in the quarter. I was very pleased with the start to the year. Mark gave a bit of an around the world view in his prepared remarks. But just a little bit more color. Specialty growth was particularly strong in the quarter, in FINPRO, in our private equity practice, construction and energy, also very, very strong results in the quarter. We had good growth in benefits. Our MGA and affinity operations also had a good quarter. So, I was quite pleased with it. I think we executed well for sure. Dan talked about our new business. The renewal line was strong as well. We are very, very focused in what’s still a very difficult market for our clients. But I think we are positioned well. And as Dan noted, the economy is picking up in some important markets for us. There is still obviously some uncertainty as Dan and Mark both noted in the macros, but I am very, very pleased with the start to the year.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, John. Let me go to Peter for a couple of minutes. Peter, Guy Carpenter has grown considerably and consistently over a number of years now. But Peter, what are you thinking about growth right now?
Peter Hearn: Thanks Dan. Mike, our model is consistent growth over a long period of time. I think we have demonstrated that, as Dan said. We do benefit from the rate increases that are going on in the market. But the bulk of our income is coming from new business wins, and it’s well balanced across all of our businesses from North America, Latin America, Middle East, Asia Pac, global specialties, all have recognized strong growth in the first quarter, and we see the same holding true for Q2. Now Q3s tend to be very small quarters for us. So, there is more volatility inherent in them. But over the past few years, we have shown once again that even with smaller quarters, based on the disciplined approach we had to new business and the approach of growing in any market condition, we have demonstrated our ability to grow.
Dan Glaser: Thanks Peter. Mike, you mentioned Mercer. So Martine, you want to talk about growth at Mercer?
Martine Ferland: Yes. Sure, Dan. We are very pleased with our quarterly – quarter 1 2021 results, especially since we were facing a comparison of 5% growth same quarter last year. We have seen increased demand in our services, sequential revenue growth months-to-months during the quarter and a return to growth actually in March. We know that during the pandemic, clients have postponed discretionary work due to uncertainty and also employment levels have dropped. But now we expect tailwinds from economic and job growth partially offset, of course, by the continued structural decline in the client benefit. But clearly, we see a return to growth for the rest of the year, starting with Q2. In terms of demands, our investment business, investment management business, in particular, with lots of demand in the alternative space, and ESG and being seemed investment opportunities is strong. We started the year with strong inflow. Demand for digital solutions around the whole of business is also strong. Health has been resilient through the pandemic, and we see lots of demand in our Darwin health platform and global benefit management. And we have seen quite a good uptick in Korea as well with demand for engagement surveys, transformation of the workplace, return to a new normal redefinition of the way to work. So overall, it looks like a strong rest of the year for Mercer.
Dan Glaser: Okay. Thanks Martine. So, we have often said how Oliver Wyman is a bit more sensitive to business confidence, economic outlook, etcetera. And their strong growth actually bodes very well for the company overall. But Scott, do you want to talk a little bit about Oliver Wyman and how you see at least the quarter and the next couple of quarters?
Scott McDonald: Yes. Happy to round out on growth for us. So, we had a really strong quarter, as you saw. I think that is driven by business confidence across really all of our sectors, particularly strong growth in the U.S. and Europe. And the growth was really widespread across all the types of business we do, whether that was a growth strategy, digital or technology transformation, some restructuring and in new areas like climate and sustainability. So, it felt really healthy. I think though, Mike, given the volatility in our business, it’s just important to maintain a long-term perspective. And we continue to be able to think we can grow the business at mid to high-single digits over the long-term. In the shorter term, with the current robust demand, the strong new sales, combined with the weaker performance from last year, we may exceed that long-term target in any quarter and possibly for the year overall.
Dan Glaser: Thanks Scott. So Mike, I know that was a lot, but I figured there would be a lot of questions on growth we might as well go around the horn and hear from our business leaders. So anything else, Mike?
Mike Zaremski: Yes, that was great. And one last quick follow-up, I believe you – Dan, you said the Marsh pricing index came in at 18%, down a little bit from 22% quarter-over-quarter. I think some investors may want to focus on that stat. So, I just wanted to get maybe potentially some more color. Pricing clearly is a tailwind. I know you said that, but I believe the majority and maybe vast majority of your revenues are on a fee basis. So, I think the beta in terms of kind of sensitivity to pricing, It’s not as influential as other brokers that are maybe more commission based. I am trying to – maybe if you can give any color around how to think about the deceleration in pricing? Thanks.
Dan Glaser: Sure. And let’s just be clear. We are on the client side of the table. So, these are – even at an 18% deceleration from 22% in the quarter sequentially, these are trying times for our clients and Marsh brokers are working really hard to put together the best package, the best solutions in the circumstances. John, you want to talk a little bit about commission versus fee and the impact of the rating environment on your overall growth just, in general terms?
John Doyle: Sure. Mike, about 60% of our revenue is commission based, but about 50% of Marsh’s total revenue is exposed P&C pricing, right. So we have commission in the benefit side as well in some markets. So as Dan noted, it’s still a very, very difficult market for our clients. And obviously, an uneven economy for so many of our clients. And so our clients, of course, are adapting to that. Some in this market and certainly throughout 2020, we are choosing to retain some more risks, whether it’s through higher retentions or lower limits. Our captive management business is experiencing pretty strong growth as well as an indicator of maybe how our clients are reacting to the market. But it’s still a difficult market. The D&O market, the excess casualty market in the U.S. and the cyber markets remain the most challenging. On the other hand, the work comp pricing continues to be pretty favorable for our clients and was modestly down. Pricing was modestly down in that product area here in the United States. So, the underwriting community is clearly concerned about elevated cat activity was obviously a busy cat quarter in the United States in the first quarter. The word lost cost inflation, lower interest rates, but my expectations is that we will continue to see some moderation of price increases throughout the rest of the year. Again, I expect prices to be up year-over-year, but I do expect them to be up somewhat less than they get up in recent quarters.
Dan Glaser: Thanks John. Next question please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, my first question, digging into another topic, expenses. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned continued low T&E in the first quarter. You also mentioned, right, some tougher comps year-over-year. And then obviously, once we get towards herd immunity, right, we could start to see somewhat of a pickup in T&E. But can you just help us think through the expenses? Any sense of how we should think about kind of run rate when we kind of get through COVID in terms of what says you can guys can kind of potentially keep on an ongoing basis?
Dan Glaser: Sure. So at least many companies, including Marsh & McLennan reduced expenses significantly, particularly in the second quarter and third quarter. And as you know, last year, we started coming back. It had positive expense growth in the fourth quarter because we did some hiring and that sort of thing. The largest reductions were in T&E and our view is that will be a gradual comeback. We believe people will travel with more purpose and more for thought than pre-pandemic, and we are certainly going to encourage that within the company. We are going to try to get away from the – anytime anywhere, hop on an airplane culture and pause and say, okay, there are important times where you go visit a client or you go visit a market. That’s absolutely to be sure. But we have proven that we can operate effectively remotely. And so we want to create that a little bit of pause and say, “Can I do this?” via a remote access like a Zoom or Teams, etcetera. And so it also is important for us in terms of as we manage our carbon footprint going forward, and it’s important for other companies, I think to act in a similar fashion. So, now one thing that let’s not lose sight of, even though there may be some pressure as some expenses start to come back, as we go through the year. That’s actually good news. That means that the world is recovering, the economy is recovering that means business is getting back to normal, that has growth implications for us. And longer term, we have learned a lot during this pandemic period, and we believe we can be a leaner, more agile organization. And that has implications. That means that while the office is core to our culture, and is a central part of how we operate, we know we can operate with more flexibility and more agility than we have done in the past. And longer term, that has implications for our real estate expense, which are quite heavy. And so I would expect that we will be able to get some savings there over time. Do you have another question, Elyse?
Elyse Greenspan: Yes. Thank you. And then my second question on the capital side of things, you guys alluded to, right, you did one deal in the Q1. My sense is that we are kind of seeing a little bit of a slowdown around some broker deals just as we – I think the expectation, right, that we could see a pickup later on in the year when there is certainty around tax reform. So, I guess I wanted to see if you guys kind of agreed with that when you were thinking through the capital plan for the year? And then did you say where we are in that $3.5 billion as of the end of Q1?
Dan Glaser: Sure. So a couple of things, and then I will hand over to Mark. I mean overall, just to bear in mind that PayneWest is April 1. So that was not a first quarter item. It’s beginning of the second quarter. But we wanted to call it out because it’s an important acquisition for the company. We have been at it for 150 years, and we have been acquiring firms for that entire period of time. Let’s not forget Henry Marsh and Donald McLennan came together and formed Marsh & McLennan. And so we don’t pay much attention to what’s happening to the tax rate, capital gains or what interest rates are because we are not looking for companies to combine with and to join us who really are just playing the economics. We cultivate relationships over long stretches of time. We almost always for our important acquisitions are in exclusive discussions with the other company. And we are coming together because we see value on both sides. We can grow better together. We can serve clients better together, etcetera. And so I don’t believe that we don’t have a budget around acquisitions. We go through our process and what happens, happens as we go through. But ultimately, let me hand to Mark and he can talk about capital management more broadly and what we have available for this year and our expectations of how we would likely use it. But Mark?
Mark McGivney: Thanks Dan. So Elyse, let me just run you through. So we still expect, as you said, roughly $3.5 billion of capital deployed this year, and I will just run you through the math of how that breaks down. We have already spent the $0.5 billion that we had targeted on deleveraging. So as I mentioned earlier, we pulled forward our July debt repayment. Dividends will run around $1 billion, and that leaves $2 billion of that $3.5 billion available for M&A and share repurchase. Dan mentioned that we closed our PayneWest, which was a chunky deal. And our M&A pipeline remains full. It’s always hard to predict how much we will actually do. But our hope is that we see a meaningful amount of M&A this year. But we also expect that we will see a meaningful amount of share repurchase, at least enough to see our share count go down this year.
Dan Glaser: Thanks Mark. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Phil Stefano: Yes. Thanks. Good morning and looking at the organic growth, I guess for international, in particular, I was surprised that the strength just given how it feels like the vaccination rates and the impact of COVID is still a bit of a headwind there. I was hoping you could talk about the potential that the different regions have to the rollout of the take-up rate of vaccinations and how we think about economic development and it might be trailing. Could there be slowdowns coming as we see fourth waves that we are fortunately not going to get in the U.S.?
Dan Glaser: Yes. I mean, we had good international growth overall in the company, both in Marsh, but also on OW and Guy Carpenter as well. And Mercer had sequential growth. So overall, I mean I would also bear in mind that over the last couple of years, we have digested the biggest acquisition in our history, and that had some headwind with us as well in terms of revenue growth. And we have seen – and disruption. So, we have seen a nice comeback in places like Latin America and also in Asia Pac than what we have been experiencing for the last year or so. But the big winner, in terms of turnaround, was UK. John, you want to talk about your business in the UK a little bit?
John Doyle: Sure, Dan. Phil, as you noted, there, of course, will be ups and downs on a global basis in any kind of normal economy. And obviously, we are still recovering and still in the pandemic, as Dan noted in his prepared remarks earlier. But I was very, very pleased with our performance in the quarter in the UK. It’s been a bit of a stress point for us over the last 18 months or so. Some of it related to just indigestion from coming together with JLT and some headwinds there. But we saw good growth, a lot of it from our middle marketing UK business, but also in the specialty areas, as I noted before, particularly strong growth in our financial lines business. The D&O market, as I said earlier, is difficult for our clients, very, very meaningful cyber growth in the UK and construction and energy were off to a terrific start. Elsewhere in the world, I think just another bright spot to point out, we saw very, very good new business growth in Australia. So, I was quite pleased with that. So yes, it was an improved performance by the international team, and we expect continued good momentum.
Dan Glaser: Anything else, Phil?
Phil Stefano: Yes. I have then a follow-up on the M&A discussion from earlier. Dan, you had mentioned when you buy things, you tend to be kind of the sole buyer at the table. I am sure there is a political way to ask this, but I am just going to be direct, so apologies. But Aon and Willis is going through a transaction, and it feels like there is going to be some businesses that come out of this that ultimately need to be divested. As I think about your global position, can you be involved in the process, right? Not whether or not you choose to be and anything is going to happen, but just given your size, is this a process you can be involved in? And can you take a look at kind of what’s being shopped?
Dan Glaser: I mean, I think the general idea of divestment would be to satisfy regulators’ concerns about having enough competitors in the marketplace. So, it would be unusual for them to look to us as a possible answer. I mean we are open to all ideas, but ultimately, I think it’s unlikely that we would be a participant in all a very small area in that kind of vein. Now having said that, there are plenty of very good, high quality firms that we are in discussions with. And so when we look at our M&A pipeline, we look over the course of years, not over the course of months, and we have got a very rich pipeline of companies that we are having discussions with. So, we feel very good about our ability to continue to add to the strength. And I would just use that as a backdrop to growth in general. Like we generally feel that underlying growth is the most important measure to evaluate the health of the overall organization. So, our focus is generally on underlying growth. But every once in a while, you have to look at GAAP, what’s the company doing on an overall basis. And if I just look at RIS, as an example, first quarter last year, we grew a very big organization on a GAAP basis, 20%, and followed up in this first quarter by an 11% on top of the 20% on a GAAP basis. We are significantly growing the organization. And on the consulting side, it was more like a 5% on GAAP last year, followed by a 6% this year on GAAP. So we are having good underlying performance, but we are also having a much larger organization and growing a much larger organization. Next question, please, operator.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. Most of my questions were answered, but a couple of points. First, on the deal environment, can you talk about competition for deals, especially sort of small and mid-sized deals? It seems like valuations have steadily gone up over the past few years. And then on pricing, you spoke about sort of a slowdown in reinsurance and a slowdown in overall – in your index. Can you talk a little bit more detail about lines of where you have seen the most noticeable change over the past 3 months, up or down?
Dan Glaser: Okay. So I will talk about your M&A point, and then I will hand off to John and Peter Hearn, so they can talk a little bit about the rate environment and a little bit more debt, although that’s really inside baseball. Ultimately, when we look at deals, as I mentioned before, we are not chasing any deals. Your conclusion that multiples have gone up over the last number of years is absolutely true. Multiples are higher, which means we should be more selective. And it means that we should understand the pro forma calculations in a deep way, because most of these organizations are private. So, the pro forma results are far different than the actual results over the previous years and there can be a disconnect in terms of what expectations are versus the reality of a performing business. Now, our goal is actually to buy high quality firms. That’s our primary goal. Firms that match our culture, where there is good chemistry, where the leaders plan to stay in the business and keep growing the business. And there are a number. It’s still a very fragmented market, and there are a number of small to mid-sized companies in which we are able to speak with who really recognize the value of Marsh & McLennan. I mean we can demonstrate the companies, the amount of additional mega producers that are developed post-acquisition by Marsh & McLennan than existed pre-acquisition. So, joining Marsh & McLennan is good for the production force of these companies. And that is a – that’s our unique selling proposition. The capabilities and resources of the organization broadly enable producers to be more successful than they otherwise would be. But John, do you want to talk about rating environment? And what’s been moving around the most? Yes, I think it’s pretty high level, and then we can move on to Peter on that.
John Doyle: Sure Dan. Jimmy, I covered it before. What I would say is that in most geographies and in most major product lines, there was a slight moderation in the average price increase in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter. It was pretty consistent, I would say, is probably the most notable thing when you look at it on a line-by-line basis and country-by-country basis. So prices on average, again went from 22% to 18%. As we have shared in the past, this is – our index skews to large accounts. The middle market pricing is more modest than that. I think the most notable quarter-to-quarter change was in cyber, where the average price increase actually doubled from the fourth quarter into the first quarter from high-teens to mid-30s. And so – and as you might expect, given the exposure environment there, our cyber sales are growing quite rapidly at the moment.
Dan Glaser: Thanks. Peter, do you have anything to add?
Peter Hearn: No. I would reflect much of what John says, Jimmy, in that reinsurance pricing has been reasonably consistent by line of business over the past several quarters. And I think it’s – the capacity is adequate, demand is high. As John said, lines of business, like cyber, have been more capacity constrained, but there is still capacity available at a price. And I think at the end of the day, the reinsurer approach to our client base has been reasonable, and it’s been based on experience and exposure of the individual client. And so prices, I wouldn’t say, have gone down. I would say prices have moderated, but that’s based on capacity. But it’s a function of exposure and experience by client. It is not a broad based across the board rate increased for everybody regardless of how you performed.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
David Motemaden: Hi, good morning. I have a question just on some of the disruption that the Aon-Willis deal could be having in the marketplace as you look at teams and hiring? Maybe you could just talk about how that’s progressing? And Dan, I think you talked about adding 500 people in headcount last quarter in terms of strategic hires. I was just wondering maybe to give an update on that this quarter? And how you see that progressing throughout the year?
Dan Glaser: Yes. I mean, we expect to be a real employer of choice in the business. And – but we are a big company, we have got 76,000 people. So, whether we lose a team of 20 people or hire 10, or 20, or 30 individuals, ultimately, it’s not a huge needle mover for us, but it’s a way for us to build our strength, build on the mountain of talent that we already have. The 500 net headcount increase in the fourth quarter didn’t all come from Aon and Willis, although the majority did. And I think in the first quarter, we are up over 100 heads net from Aon and Willis. And I would expect that kind of thing to continue. This is a competitive environment and I do believe working at Marsh & McLennan is a choice, not just for companies going through consolidation, but for experts broadly within our industry.
David Motemaden: Got it. That’s helpful. Thanks for that Dan. And then I guess just another question. Just taking a look at other operating expenses, those were down quite a bit year-over-year. I think it was down 10.5% year-over-year versus basically flat last quarter, both against pre-COVID comps. I guess I am wondering, were there any timing or sort of delayed expenses this quarter outside of T&E or any sort of other sort of COVID-related expense reductions during the quarter?
Dan Glaser: Yes. No, the comparison is a bit different. Things like meetings, for example, like you take the first quarter, what do you do when the year starts, you get together and you talk about growth. So, that happened in 2020. It didn’t happen in 2021. But – so meeting some advertising, some use of facilities, that sort of thing. But we are not really overly concerned about the expense comparisons. We were always working to move our other operating expenses down. To me, the glory would be a nice, solid, chunky comp and ben ratio and a much lower other operating expense ratio. That’s the kind of thing over time that we want to do. And we have all kinds of initiatives in the firm to try to reduce other operating expenses as a way to deliver better margin, but also to deliver better comp and ben ratios as well. And as you will note, comp and ben ratios were up in the quarter. And so that to me is a pretty good thing. Other operating expenses down, comp and ben flat or up. That’s a pretty good result, with delivering big margin expansion for shareholders as well. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is open.
Meyer Shields: With a question for Peter, you have described, I think consistently high reinsurance demand and solid capacity. Does the Florida – the upcoming Florida reinsurance renewals, does that look any different than what we have seen so far in 1.1 and 4.1?
Dan Glaser: Peter, right over to you.
Peter Hearn: Yes. Thank you, Dan. Meyer, if we look through the rest of the year and obviously, June, what is the next big renewal date, I think we have to separate Florida from the rest of the – of our portfolio because it’s a different animal in a lot of different ways, not only from a regulatory environment, not only from a capital environment, not only from a capacity environment, not only from a legal environment. So, as we look out into the rest of the year, we anticipate that for the broad percentage of our portfolio that pricing will remain consistent. Again, as I just said, it isn’t based on individual client exposure and experience. Florida, obviously, has gone through quite a turbulent time not only from a loss standpoint, but an underlying erosion of capital due to heightened litigation. What that’s resulted in is demand is actually going to be less because people are re-underwriting their books of business to deal with some of the spikes and exposure that they have. But overall, I would say there is more than enough capacity in Florida. And for the non-frequency layers and more capacity layers, there will be plenty of capacity. And for the lower down, higher risk layers, pricing will go up. We are still unsure as to what the dimensions are. We are expecting mid to high-single digits for loss experience, high loss experience. And it’s still wait-and-see. But a lot of the capital in Florida comes from third-party capital, unlike the rest of our portfolio say for our retrocessional business.
Meyer Shields: Okay. That’s tremendously helpful. Thank you. And then I was hoping to slide in a question for John. When you look at the small account component of your domestic P&C business, can you talk about how that – whether pricing or underwriting asset has changed over the last 3 months to 6 months?
John Doyle: Sure, Meyer. Really, in most market cycles, middle market, the small commercial pricing just doesn’t move with the same level of volatility that we see in the upper middle market and in large multinational accounts. And that this market cycle, really the last couple of years, it’s been quite consistent with that observation. We saw, most of last year, small commercial. And there is a bit of not every insurer looks at the market kind of the same way, but small to the lower end of the middle market, we saw low-single digit price increases most of last year. It accelerated a bit in the fourth quarter to mid-single digit increases, and that’s what we observed in the first quarter as well. What I would note in that segment where we do see more commission than we do in other parts of our business. Work comp, though is a huge part of our business there. And as I noted earlier, work comp pricing remains pretty favorable for our clients.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan, for any closing remarks.
Dan Glaser: Thank you. Thanks, everybody. I thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning. I want to thank our 76,000 colleagues for your perseverance under trying circumstances. These are the moments when our clients need us most. Thank you all very much, and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-01-28 14:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan's Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. Fourth quarter 2020 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company’s Web site at mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements, including certain expectations related to COVID-19 and other matters. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC Web site.
Dan Glaser: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I’m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. 2020 was a year like no other and Marsh & McLennan’s response and performance was nothing short of remarkable in these circumstances. The year was characterized by tough choices that we made as a business and as individuals. Our colleagues rose to the occasion and demonstrated resilience, courage, agility, collaboration and empathy in the face of the global pandemic and social unrest. Times like these validate our purpose to make a difference in the moments that matter for our clients, colleagues and communities, and we did exactly that. Our 2020 adjusted EPS growth of 7% is impressive in one of the worst economic recessions ever. Our strong financial performance also enabled us to continue to invest for the future. We continue to develop digital technologies to offer more robust client solutions. We made a number of strategic hires and achieved a record year of acquired revenue with MMA through eight acquisitions, with approximately 235 million of annualized revenue.  Looking forward, while the global pandemic will most likely dominate at least the first half of 2021, there are brighter days ahead. Our proprietary pandemic navigator model predicts that as vaccines are rolled out and we move closer to herd immunity, through natural immunity, infection case counts and vaccinations, the U.S. and UK could see a return to more normal patterns sometime in the back half of the year. As we emerge from the crisis, clients around the world can rely on our expertise, with the three areas that are critical for every organization, risk, strategy and people. The World Economic Forum's Annual Global Risks Report which was released last week and prepared with the support of Marsh & McLennan and other partners highlight some of the most likely and impactful risks facing the world today, and we are working with clients to navigate these issues.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, Dan, and good morning. We're pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results, which was strong despite the challenges of 2020. We grew our top line, delivered solid earnings growth and entered 2021 with a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. Consolidated revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter to 4.4 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 1%. Operating income was 571 million, while adjusted operating income was 855 million. Our adjusted operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 21.3%. GAAP EPS was $0.73 and adjusted EPS was $1.19. Looking at risk and insurance services, fourth quarter revenue grew 6% to 2.5 billion and was up 3% on an underlying basis, or 4%, excluding the impact of a decline in fiduciary interest. We are pleased with this excellent finish to the year, which demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business in the face of the pandemic. Adjusted operating income decreased 5% to 525 million and the adjusted margin contracted 220 basis points to 23.5%, reflecting the expected increase in expense in the fourth quarter.  For the year, revenue was 10.3 billion, an increase of 8% with solid underlying growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income growth for the year was impressive at 14%, and our adjusted operating margin in RIS increased 170 basis points to 28%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter rose 7% to 2.4 billion increasing 4% on an underlying basis. In the U.S. and Canada division, underlying growth was 7% for the quarter and 5% for the full year, driven by strength across the portfolio. 2020 represents the third straight year of 5% or higher underlying growth in U.S. and Canada. In the international division, underlying revenue was flat in the quarter with Latin America up 3%, Asia Pacific up 1% and EMEA down 2%. For the full year, revenue at Marsh was 8.6 billion, an increase of 7% or 3% on an underlying basis.
Dan Glaser: Thank you, Mark. Operator, we’re ready to go to the Q&A.
Operator: Certainly. . Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question was on the outlook for 2021. You guys pointed to 3% to 5% overall organic revenue growth. Just trying to get a sense embedded in that, what’s the views for RIS versus consulting. And then given that you guys obviously expect the economy to start to rebound, I think you said, Dan, in the second quarter, but should we assume that the growth is better in the back three quarters than the Q1?
Dan Glaser: Yes, it's a good question, Elyse. We were 3% to 5% growth on an underlying basis for 10 straight years before 2020. And so we feel that it's actually really positive that we're believing we will return to that 3% to 5% growth in 2021. The difference between RIS and consulting has more to do with what's happening in the global economy and macro factors, business confidence. Obviously, as demonstrated this year, the RIS business is a bit more resilient with higher levels of recurring revenues in the consulting business. But we're still hopeful actually that we will grow our consulting business in 2021 in both Mercer and Oliver Wyman, and that's actually our plan. We do expect that there would be more strength from the second quarter onwards, because the first quarter, you're basically comparing a pre-COVID world with a COVID world. And so there will be some challenges within that. But we've got some pretty decent momentum that we built throughout the year. And so we're expecting a good year in 2021. As we mentioned in the script, we expect that margin expansion for the year and we also expect solid adjusted EPS growth.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, that's helpful. And then my second question I guess is also on the other component of guidance, the margin improvement. You guys did, like you said, a pretty good job of managing your expenses during the second and the third quarter. Sounds like there was a little bit more reinvestment, some stuff that got put off I think you said in the fourth quarter. So I guess the same question I was thinking about on the margin side. It sounds like maybe there could be constraints on the Q2 and the Q3, because those are pretty tough comps. But I guess that's one part of the question. And then the same thing, are you implying, Dan, since you said, potentially growth in both consulting and RIS that both segments could see margin improvement in 2021?
Dan Glaser: Our margin improvement in 2021 will in part be a function of where organic growth is. When we look at it, you say we did a pretty good job of the second quarter. My God, we rattled back expenses fast. Expense growth was down 5% in the second quarter, 4% in the third quarter. So I think it was a remarkable job. Not impacting the business itself, continuing to invest in the business, but managing our expenses aggressively and setting a very high bar for what was required in the midst of a real crisis, a real global crisis. And so the fourth quarter represents to us of getting back not quite to normal, but looking at pacing the way we normally would do. A little inside baseball in that we -- clearly we did a number of strategic hiring in the fourth quarter. We're actually up 500 or actually close to 500 headcount in the fourth quarter. And so we're positioned well for 2021. I'm not worried about quarter-by-quarter comparisons looking at 2021 versus 2020, because 2020 in a lot of ways is such a unique, bizarre type of year. So we're going to run our business the way we run our business as we usually do, where revenue growth exceeds expense growth in almost every quarter, and certainly in every year as it has done for the last 13 years. So, I know that the entire firm was very interested in doing our best to turn the page on 2020 and focus on 2021. And in the fourth quarter, we started really focusing on what that would mean. So I think we're positioned to grow decently in both. Whether our margin goes up in both segments or not, I'm not going to really talk about right now. Our expectation is that we will grow margins. Now, are we going to grow margins to the extent that we did as an overall company in 2020? Well, that would be a very tall ask, bearing in mind all the expenses that were pulled back in the second and third quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.
Mike Zaremski: Hi. Good morning. I guess I'll ask the expense question a little differently. You said remarkable job kind of pulling back on expenses. So, I guess do you feel that or any kind of lessons or things that you think that can expense wise or operating leverage wise can kind of persist permanently, or are you saying kind of the relationship between revenues and expenses kind of hopefully just goes back to the old relationship as the world opens up and things get back to normal?
Dan Glaser: It's a complicated question, but I think the answer is both. I do think we will return to a more normal pattern to where we look at revenue growth in the 3% to 5% area. Our expense growth for a number of years, four out of the last five years before 2020, was average – was not average. It was actually 2% growth. So our expense growth normally would be around 2% as it's been. Now some years it might be 3%, some years it might be 1%, but ultimately I think that's the more normal pattern. We do see the opportunity of certain things that we've learned during this year, during the year 2020 to continue. Clearly, when you think about things like where a business is filled with knowledge workers and subject matter experts, so remote working is manageable for us. So our choice of returning to offices is just that. It's a choice. We think it's better for the business. We expect our offices, physical offices to remain really the hub of activity in Marsh & McLennan. But having said that, we also think that over a period of a few years that we would be able to reduce our footprint a bit, and that would actually benefit shareholders but it would also benefit colleagues by making their life a bit more flexible and a bit easier. So certainly, that's an area of having a more actual real estate footprint is an example. We also operated much faster and more connected during COVID than we did previously. And there's an efficiency gain with that that we absolutely want to keep. I don’t think T&E. I think it's going to be a while before travel snaps back to the levels that we had in like 2019. And maybe it will be quite a while. I do expect people, once this COVID clears and the crisis is over, to return to travel to see markets and to see clients, but maybe we won't travel quite as much in the past like we used to, and maybe we won't jump on an airplane at a moment's notice. It could be more like, well, let's talk on Zoom, because everybody's used to that now. So I do think that there is lasting efficiency gain which will benefit shareholders in the post COVID world.
Mike Zaremski: Okay, great. And last, a follow up switching gears a little bit to some of the more consulting centric businesses. I guess a lot of the questions we get are about whether organic will kind of succumb to some cost cutting actions some corporations are taking. I guess on the other hand, there seems to be a lot of uncertainty out there, which sometimes can lead to a new political administration, which could actually be a tailwind for parts of your consulting businesses. So maybe you can kind of talk through some of the pluses and minuses you’re seeing? Thanks.
Dan Glaser: Sure. I’ll lead that off and then I'll hand off to Martine and Scott who can give you a little bit more detail. Our consulting businesses, yes, they have less recurring revenue and parts of the career business and Oliver Wyman are project based. But having said that, they're resilient businesses and there's still plenty of activity as demonstrated versus performance through the year, which was minus 3, but much stronger, minus 3 the last three quarters and actually minus 1 for the year, which actually is much stronger than during the financial crisis. And areas like health and investments, retirement security are lasting and have resilience in and of themselves. Oliver Wyman's pop in the fourth quarter was a bit unexpected for us and it gave us -- usually as I've mentioned before, they tend to be a bit of a canary in the coal mine as the business confidence and thoughts. And so let me go to Martine first and then Scott who can give you a little bit more flavor for how they see growth in their business in 2020. Martine?
Martine Ferland: Yes. Well, thanks, Ben and Mike for the question. Actually we're pleased, as Dan said, about the new business activities that we've seen in the current challenging circumstances. And we look at what the world needs right now in terms of redefining the world of work, addressing health challenges. And also we've seen quite a lot of demand in the investment solutions side of our portfolio. We've closed the year at a record level of assets under management at $357 billion. So I'd say health has been resilient through the crisis. We grew 2%. And we see a bright spot there in terms of digital solutions demand for virtual care, mental health, for example, or workforce communication. As I said, wealth, of course, we have the structural decline in the defined benefit, but that has slowed down a bit during 2020. And we've seen a lot of project work related to market volatility. So that could continue. But definitely our investment solutions are very much in demand. And then for us, career is our most discretionary project work business, in particular on the service side of career. But career usually rebound with the economy. And as Dan said in his remarks, we expect the economy recovery to come back at least in part of H2 and therefore -- and we are seeing some strength in the career pipeline. We've seen that in Q4. So all-in-all, I think our services are very relevant for the times. We're watching, of course, the agenda from the Biden administration. But we think that we are well positioned there. In particular, we are very strong in ESG, like diversity and inclusion consulting and also on responsible investment, and helping clients address the transition to a low carbon economy. So I think as soon as the economy comes back, I think we should see a good rebound.
Dan Glaser: Thank you, Martine. Scott, let’s talk a little bit about how you see 2021.
Scott McDonald: Yes, sure, Dan and Mike. From an underlying perspective, we had a very strong Q4 and we had strong business activity across most segments of the business and real particular strengths in areas like financial services, health, the public sector and our actuarial and living cost businesses. And the type of business we're doing was really broad based. And it ranged all the way from growth strategies and digital transformation to the other end of restructuring and bankruptcy. I think the lesson I'm drawing from that is that there's a lot to do out there as businesses recover after the pandemic and they rebuild, they grow, they evolve, transform. Oliver Wyman also tends to focus on big companies, which have performed relatively better than small companies over the last period. Looking into the new year, our new sales in the pipeline are also strong. But as you said in your question, clients are facing significant uncertainty as they hopefully managed through the last leg to the pandemic. But looking at to the whole year, I think the first quarter could be challenging. But beyond that, I feel really good about our business, our prospects and our ability to grow. Companies are certainly challenged and they've got at least another quarter or more of challenge and uncertainty. But they have a lot to do. They need a lot of support. And I think between Oliver Wyman and Mercer, we have many of the things they need.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Scott. Next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank.
Phil Stefano: Yes, thanks. I want to go back to the expenses for a moment. And I think last quarter, the commentary was that it would be up sequentially, but maybe not to the extent that we saw on a year-over-year basis, and it feels like it was higher than that. And I was hoping you could talk around -- my suspicion is there was an opportunity for investment or hiring. Maybe you can better flush that out.
Dan Glaser: It's a good question, Phil. And it's a good catch. My expectation on the call for our third quarter was that expenses would kick in the fourth quarter, but they would still be negative on a year-over-year basis. And actually they're positive on a year-over-year basis. Our expenses grew 1.5% or 2% in the fourth quarter. So it was a bit of a surprise. There’s two factors underneath that. One, we didn't expect Oliver Wyman to grow in the fourth quarter and Oliver Wyman grew. And as I've mentioned before, they have the most variable compensation model. And so when they're growing, that's when we build in more on terms of variable comp. So that was something that we did. And the hiring that we did in the fourth quarter on the strategic recruitment side was higher than what we expected. We see a lot of opportunities out there. And as I mentioned, we're up nearly 500 headcount on a net basis in the fourth quarter. So that was a little bit more. So those are the two factors that contributed to us having expenses. It's important to point out, neither of those factors in and of themselves are one way. Certainly with the strategic improvement, we expect revenue over time as a result of building out our headcount as we've done for many years in a row. And the variable comp increase in OW to me is a good news story, because it's attached to growth. And so I would love for that to continue, because it would signify that we're growing the top line in Oliver Wyman.
Phil Stefano: Okay. And dialing in on the RIS international businesses, to what extent do the different regions within there have different organic growth profiles in the short run? And I'm trying to think through the various regions’ ability to manage vaccinations, to adopt stimulus programs and things like that? Should we see significant difference in these regions as we look in the very short term?
Dan Glaser: Yes, it's a good question. And I'll start it off and then I'll hand over to John who's got the biggest international footprint and also to Peter so he can weigh in as to what he's seeing in different parts of the world and expectation levels. Let's bear in mind, just to start, our top six countries represent about 75% to 77% of our revenue. So you look at the United States, UK, Canada, Australia, France and Germany, that’s a big part of our company. And so it's pretty developed economies stuff. But we always have some level of variability, as you mentioned, and there's going to be different rollouts and there's going to be different timing as to when the individual countries return to normal. But, John, how do you see regional growth patterns as you go forward into 2021?
John Doyle: Sure, and thank you for the question. Look, we expect a better growth trajectory in the international business in 2021. Of course, the economic outlook matters. And many parts of the world struggled more from an economic perspective as a byproduct, of course, of the pandemic saw maybe less government intervention to support the economies. What I would say, too, internationally, at least in many markets, maybe not the UK, maybe not Australia, or some other more developed markets, a lot of premium spend can be quite discretionary. And so you have liability environments that are very, very different than the countries that I mentioned earlier. And we also saw less price and less rate increase in many of those markets as well. So I think overall, I would expect less premium growth from an insurer perspective internationally than what we saw in the U.S. where as you saw, we had very, very strong revenue growth this year. But again, I'm optimistic about '21. It should be a better year.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, John. Peter, you want to give us Guy Carpenter's perspective of regional growth patterns?
Peter Hearn: Sure. Our 2020 international business was fantastic. We had strong double digit growth in Latin America, Asia Pacific, EMEA operations, our UK operations. And it's fascinating because we have not seen any weakness in the underlying subject premium basis from our clients. And quite frankly, uncertainty creates demand in the reinsurance business. The uncertainty created by COVID and the potential loss magnitude has increased demand in all of our businesses. But for the first time in a long time, our international businesses have all grown by strong double digits. And we see the same thing for 2021.
Dan Glaser: Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. So first just a question on capital deployment. I think you mentioned 3.5 billion. And I guess about 1 billion of that will be used for dividends, about 0.5 billion for debt retirement, so the remaining 2 billion. Should we assume that buybacks will be consistent with what you've done in the past which is sort of offset the -- or keep the share count constant or go down a little bit, or would you consider being more active, either based on the stock price or just your deal pipeline?
Dan Glaser: Sure. Thanks, Jimmy. So Mark mentioned that we will deploy approximately 3.5 billion of capital in 2021. And Mark, you want to take that question and give a little bit of our philosophy how we’re thinking about that?
Mark McGivney: Sure. Jimmy, your math is good. The 3.5 billion; your 1 billion for dividends, 0.5 billion in debt paydown and your remainder of 2 billion. As I said earlier and as we've said consistently, we favor acquisitions. And so as we think about that, that $2 billion bucket, the lean is going to be M&A. Our M&A pipeline is good. But I would say we do expect a meaningful amount of share repurchases. Just the exact amount is really going to depend on the strength of the M&A pipeline as we go through the year.
Jimmy Bhullar: And how is just the competition for deals and sort of availability of attractive properties, because there does seem to be a lot of interest and there's ongoing consolidation in the market?
Mark McGivney: Yes. Jimmy, we’re the market leader. We don't compete an awful lot for assets in the marketplace in any kind of competitive bidding processes. At the end, the majority of companies that we acquire were in exclusive negotiations. And their decision oftentimes is, are they going to come with Marsh & McLennan or will they remain private. That is how it works on the majority of ours. So we're not chasing deals. And frankly, if a company is debating whether they should sell to us as a combination that would help them grow better and give better career path into their colleague base and they’re viewing that as to what about private equity as an example, as an alternative, then they were not ready for really that conversation. At the end, we like doing transactions in which we're not selling ourselves and they're not selling themselves. We're deciding in combination that working together will enable more flow for the combined operation on a go-forward basis. So we're highly selected. We're not doing dozens and dozens of deals, as you see that takes place out there in the market. And as I said, most of our acquisitions were in some element of exclusive discussion.
Dan Glaser: Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. Dan, I don't know if you mentioned this before and I missed it, but the nearly 500 headcount increase in the fourth quarter, was that more weighted towards RIS or consulting?
Dan Glaser: Yes. At the end, I don't have the precise number for you. My view in it would be RIS weighted. But consulting, we intend -- if I look at our overall headcount for the total company in 2020, it is up slightly versus 2019. So it's not that we've emptied the cupboard and then we've achieved our margin expansion in 2020 in a way that's going to impact us negatively into the future. We are well prepared for a rebound. And certainly RIS had a very strong year and is the market leader. And so we are the employer of choice in the industry and we have a lot of opportunities to build our headcount with really quality subject matter experts and producing people as we go forward.
Meyer Shields: Okay, that's helpful. On a different topic, I guess you and Martine mentioned the record assets under management. Can you give us a framework for how we should think about that impacting earnings?
Dan Glaser: Sure. It's not a direct read-through. Obviously, with AUM growing, we earn more revenue generally from that. It also creates a bit more volatility to us as we go forward. But it's very much a good news story. I think the CAGR on AUM mid 20s over the last five years or so. So, Martine, how should Meyer and others think about AUM when it comes down to what does it mean for Mercer's business?
Martine Ferland: Yes. Well, it's definitely a very strong suit for us, and also the demand through the COVID crisis has increased. We’ve seen the same on the global financial crisis. When the market becomes more uncertain, the demand for improved governance and transaction agility really drive demand for us, and we're seeing this. So we had very, very strong inflows in 2020. We're seeing a very good pipeline for 2021. And, of course, there's always the aspect of capital market in that business that impacts AUM itself, but also the revenue. And then within the offering, Meyer, there's different types. So we have pension assets and we have non-pension assets, and there's a – the client really decide on the asset mix, so the exposure to whether equity or bonds or private markets. We think that actually the way that we deploy these assets, there's just mitigation or risk in itself because of the diversification of the portfolio. So I would say that the revenue flows depends on when the AUM funds in the year, but it's been a success and growth story so far.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Martine. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up a bit on the underlying expenses and just how to think about it. So, Dan, you mentioned earlier, it was a bit above what you had expected in 4Q or at least what you had expected in the third quarter. I guess how should we be thinking about it as we look forward into '21? Based on how I calculate, it looks like underlying expenses were up 1% in 2020. Would you still expect it to be in that 2% to 3% range in '21, or is some of the timing impact kind of -- would that maybe bring the underlying expense growth below that range as we look to '21?
Dan Glaser: Well, it's an impossible question to answer without knowing the organic or underlying growth rate for 2021 in each of our businesses, because a fair amount of our expense growth is linkage with variable comp. Our bonus pool increased in 2020. In fact, the overall Marsh & McLennan bonus pool has never been higher than in 2020, because profitability was up considerably. And so what I look forward to next year or 2021 rather, I look at it and say, almost certainly revenue is going to exceed expense growth as it has for the last 13 years. It may not be in every quarter, but certainly that's how we run the business for a year. I think a lot of our expense pop in the fourth quarter was non-run rate. Some of it was, but a lot of it wasn't. And so I look at it pretty simply. For 10 years prior to COVID, we grew underlying revenue between 3% and 5% and we delivered an adjusted EPS CAGR over that decade of close to 12%. So ultimately, that's what we were playing for the idea that as long as we grow underlying revenue, we can run our business and the expense side of our business in a way to develop strong adjusted EPS growth, and that's kind of how I think about 2021.
David Motemaden: Okay, great. That's helpful, Dan. Thanks. And maybe just a quick question or maybe not so quick, but a question for John. Just wondering what your thoughts are on the primary PNC market pricing environment. And I guess how long do you think that this current hardening rate environment will continue? I think there's been some discussion out there that it may start to taper off at the end of the year, and maybe be more in line with loss trend, but just wanted to get your sense in terms of the direction of the market.
Dan Glaser: John, you want to take that.
John Doyle: Sure, David, the market remains very challenging for our clients in the quarter. Dan talked about the overall price increase at 22% versus 20% in the third quarter. 2020 was obviously a really difficult year for insurers; cat losses, COVID losses, social inflation, low interest rates. So, it certainly accelerated -- COVID certainly accelerated the trend for rising prices throughout 2020. U.S., UK and Australia are the most difficult markets generally speaking for our clients. Looking forward, I'm most concerned, again, from our clients’ perspective, about D&O pricing and excess liability pricing, the excess liability market primarily here in the U.S. Just a lot of ongoing discussion about growing claim frequency, growing claim severity in part, again, driven by social inflation. But just broad concerns in the underwriting community about rate adequacy there. Work comp remains, pricing remains down on the other hand and it’s been down candidly a bit longer than I’ve been expecting, but good for our clients. We are seeing some lines of business where the rate increase line kind of flattened out or began to moderate. And that's not to say that prices were down, but the average increase in the fourth quarter, like in our property book, for example, wasn't up as much as it was in the third quarter. So again, overall, from my clients’ point of view, I'm most concerned about D&O and excess liability pricing. I do think as time wears on throughout the rest of 2021, other lines of business will likely moderate a bit.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan, for any closing remarks.
Dan Glaser: I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I'd also like to thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in 2020, which, of course, was a very challenging year. I want to thank our clients for their continued support. I look forward to speaking to all of you next quarter. Be well.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.

Please refer to the schedule in today’s earnings release. I’ll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Dan Glaser: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I’m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. We are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results, which demonstrate the continued strong execution and resilience of Marsh & McLennan in these challenging times. The economic impact of the pandemic continues to unfold. Governments swiftly provided necessary stimulus earlier this year and societies adapting as healthcare professionals continue to drive better health outcomes. Nevertheless, the consequences are likely to be with us for some time. This is not a sprint or even a 10-K. It is a marathon. Oliver Wyman’s pandemic navigator model and experts currently predict that even in the more optimistic scenarios, where a vaccine or therapeutics are developed and available, we are still unlikely to return to more normal conditions before the end of 2021. At Marsh & McLennan, we are prepared for the long-haul. The company has been resilient amidst the challenges of 2020. We are experiencing one of the worst recessions in history and our performance to-date is nothing short of outstanding in the circumstances. Times like these validate our purpose to make a difference in moments that matter. We’ve done just that by helping clients with issues of the day, including healthcare solutions, risk management, cyber, climate, enhanced resilience, digital transformation, diversity strategies among others. Our focus on risk, strategy and people is more critical than ever and our colleagues have demonstrated incredible dedication and agility. Supporting our colleagues is always a major priority and is even more critical during the pandemic. Just last week, we received the results of our most recent calling engagement survey. Our support has been validated by the results, which showed record engagement scores. Looking at our execution during this period, it’s been impressive. At Marsh, our year-to-date underlying growth is 3%. Guy Carpenter is having a strong year with 6% underlying growth for the first nine months. Consulting has experienced more of an adverse impact. We are pleased the effects are not as severe as we saw during the financial crisis. The expense discipline across the firm has allowed us to achieve strong margin expansion and 9% adjusted EPS growth year-to-date. Our solid earnings growth coupled with a firm-wide focused on working capital is driving significant free cash flow enabling us to increase our dividend complete acquisitions and remain largely on track with our de-leveraging plans. We achieved all this while at the same time, continuing to position the company for the long-term. We are pursuing strategic hires and seeing opportunity to benefit from industry consolidation. We continue to build out MMA through acquisition with 2020 seeing the most revenue acquired and capital deployed since we launched the business in 2009, and the pipeline is solid. In addition opportunities to benefit from new areas of growth, increase our penetration of existing markets, as well as achieve higher levels of efficiency. with the heavy lifting from the JLT integration, well behind us, we are connected, unified and focused on growth in all dimensions. We are executing well and I see opportunity to emerge from this period even stronger. The crisis proved that our workforce is agile and there was opportunity over the long-term to operate with greater flexibility, increase the use of technology, reduce travel, and shrink our real estate footprint. This will not only drive savings for shareholders, but increase colleague satisfaction and enhance our ability to bring the best of Marsh & McLennan to every client situation. In some ways, the crisis acted as a natural accelerant for collaboration and cross business activity. We are increasingly bringing together our businesses to help clients. For example, COVID-19 increased the cyber risk profile of nearly every firm and our businesses are working hand in hand to deliver holistic cyber advisory and insurance solutions to aid in mitigation, response and remediation. We are also bringing the businesses together to help clients address the climate risk. Marsh’s consulting, Oliver Wyman and Guy Carpenter came together recently held a major international bank, analyze and create a mitigation strategy on climate risk. Mercer, Oliver Wyman and Marsh’s consulting continue to come together to assist clients with return to office initiatives in the face of the global pandemic. By leveraging their combined data, we are providing clients with operational support, predictive models for reopening, financial planning, communication strategies, and overall benefit reviews. Underpinning these initiatives is the proprietary data and analytics from Oliver Wyman’s pandemic navigator model, which was recently recognized as one of the most accurate predictive models of COVID-19 cases and fatalities, and it’s utilized by the CVC. These are just some of the examples of the collaboration and innovation that support our continued growth potential. Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance market conditions. The third quarter marks the 12th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index increased 20% year-over-year versus 19% in the second quarter and 14% in the first quarter. Global property insurance was up 21%, and global financial and professional lines were up 40% while global casualty rates are up 6% on average and workers’ compensation pricing remain negative in the period. Keep in mind, our index used to large account business. However U.S. small and middle market insurance pricing continues to accelerate as well. Although the magnitude of price increases is less than for large complex accounts. Pricing continues to react to multiple external headwinds impacting insurer profitability and this is only exacerbated by COVID-19 losses, which continued to evolve. COVID-19 will be a law in complicated loss and the interpretation of various policyholder wordings will be determined in the courts over time. In reinsurance, price increases evidenced at the 4/1 Japan renewals and 6/1 Florida renewals continued into the 10/1 renewals. These were larger increases than at January 1, but primarily driven by loss impacted business. Guy Carpenter’s U.S. rate online index was up 12% year-over-year in July reflecting reduced alternative capital inflows, constrained retrocessional capacity and traditional reinsurers exercising caution regarding the amount of capital they are willing to expose in the face of wind, wildfire and developing COVID-19 losses. We are currently near the tail end of one of the most active hurricane seasons in U.S. history with a record level of named storms, making landfall while numerous aggregate losses were thankfully not as severe as they could have been. The P&C insurance and reinsurance markets overall are showing a heightened degree of scrutiny and risk selection with continue push for higher pricing. As the advocates for the client, we remain steadfast in our goal to deliver the highest quality coverage at the best possible terms. And these challenging market conditions highlight the value of the advice and services that Marsh & McLennan delivers. Now, let me turn to our third quarter financial performance. We delivered adjusted EPS growth of 6%, despite the global impact of COVID-19. Our EPS growth in the quarter reflects great execution on the part of our colleagues and continued expense discipline. Total revenue was unchanged versus a year ago at $4 billion and down 1% on an underlying basis. Underlying revenue grew 2% in RIS and declined 4% in consulting. In Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue was $2.3 billion, an increase of 4%. Underlying revenue growth was up 2% in the quarter, reflecting solid growth of 3% in Marsh and flat at Guy Carpenter, which overcame a previously disclosed $17 million one-time benefit in the year-ago period. RIS adjusted operating income increased 24% to $388 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 280 basis points versus a year ago. In Consulting, third quarter revenue was $1.7 billion. Underlying revenue declined by 4% for the quarter. Oliver Wyman immerses career business continue to feel the greatest impact from recessionary conditions. Consulting adjusted operating income declined by 5% and the adjusted margin expanded 20 basis points versus a year ago. Overall, adjusted operating income increased 9% versus a year ago to $638 million. Our adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points to 18.4% adjusted earnings per share increased 6% versus a year ago to $0.82 per share. Even though the impact with COVID-19 may be far from over, our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance is evidence that we are executing well in this challenging environment. Given our excellent third quarter performance, our full-year outlook has improved. for the full-year 2020, we now expect underlying revenue to be roughly flat with growth in RIS offset by a decline in Consulting. In addition, we expect to generate mid single-digit growth in adjusted EPS for the full year. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, Dan and good morning. We’re pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results, which demonstrate the resilience of our business as well as how well we are executing through the crisis. Despite a modest decline and underlying revenue in the quarter, we generated solid earnings growth, strong free cash flows and margin expansion in both segments. Overall revenue was flat in the third quarter and declined 1% on an underlying basis. Operating income in the quarter was $540 million, an increase of 15% over last year. adjusted operating income increased 9% to $638 million and our adjusted margin increased 150 basis points to 18.4%. GAAP EPS increased to $0.62 in the quarter and adjusted EPS increased 6% to $0.82. for the first nine months of 2020, total revenue growth was 3% with underlying growth of 1%. Our adjusted operating income grew 12%. Our adjusted operating margin increased 180 basis points to 23.8% and our adjusted EPS increased 9% to $3.77. in Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue grew 4% to $2.3 billion with underlying growth of 2%. A decline in fiduciary interest income driven by lower interest rates served as 100 basis point drag on underlying growth in the third quarter and 60 basis point drag for the nine months. operating income increased 52% to $333 million. adjusted operating income increased 24% to $388 million and the adjusted margin increased 280 basis points to 20.2%. for the first nine months of the year, RIS revenue was $7.8 billion, representing growth of 8% and underlying growth of 3%. adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year was up 20% to $2.1 billion. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2 billion with underlying growth of 3% representing another solid quarter of growth considering the macroeconomic headwinds. U.S. and Canada grew 5% on an underlying basis in the quarter, led by strong growth in MMA. This marks the 13th consecutive quarter. The U.S. and Canada has delivered 3% or higher underlying growth. In international underlying growth was 2% with Asia Pacific up 4%, Latin America up 2% and EMEA flat. For the first nine months, revenue at Marsh was $6.2 billion with underlying growth of 3%. U.s. and Canada was up 4% while international was up 2%. Guy Carpenter continues to have a great year. Guy Carpenter’s revenue was $274 million in the quarter, which was flat on both the reported and underlying basis. As we disclosed previously, Guy Carpenter’s growth in the third quarter of last year benefited from the true-up of a multi-year contract. Excluding this item, underlying growth was 6% in the quarter and reflects continued solid results across the portfolio. For the first nine months of the year, Guy Carpenter’s revenue was $1.5 billion, 6% underlying growth. In Consulting, third quarter revenue was $1.7 billion. underlying revenue was down 4% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of the current crisis. adjusted operating income decreased 5% to $306 million while the adjusted margin increased 20 basis points to 18.9%. For the first nine months of the year, Consulting’s revenue was $5.1 billion, down 2% on an underlying basis and adjusted operating income declined 6% to $860 million. Mercer’s revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, down 3% on an underlying basis. Wealth underlying revenue decreased 3% led by a decline in DB. within wealth however, we continue to see growth in the outsourced CIO business and at the end of the quarter, our assets under management were approximately $321 billion. This 5% sequential increase was driven by strong new funding and marketing. health underlying growth is flat in the quarter and career underlying revenue was down 11%. Careers, where we have more discretionary projects business, which is seeing the most impact from the crisis. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $3.6 billion, down 1% on an underlying basis. Oliver Wyman’s revenue was $480 million in the quarter, a decline of 6% on an underlying basis. This marks an improvement from the pace of decline in the second quarter, and reflects stronger sales and continued solid delivery of projects. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $1.5 billion, a decline of 6% on an underlying basis. Turning to corporate. Adjusted corporate expense was $56 million in the quarter. Based on our current outlook, we expect approximately $58 million in the fourth quarter. We had $2 million of investment income on an adjusted basis in the quarter and we continue to expect the contribution from investment income for the balance of 2020 will be immaterial. On a GAAP basis, investment income was a loss of $14 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting a change in the market value of our remaining investment in Alexander Forbes. foreign exchange was a $0.02 headwind to adjusted EPS in the quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a slight benefit in the fourth quarter. our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 26.5% compared with 25% in the third quarter last year. excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 25.5%. Through the first nine months of the year, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.6%, compared with 24.3% last year, and we expect the full-year rate to be between 25% and 26% due in part to an expected impact from discrete items in the fourth quarter. Turning to the JLT integration, I’m happy to report that the bulk of integration activity is largely behind this, and we have achieved the vast majority of the targeted savings, which is well ahead of schedule. We incurred $44 million of JLT integration and restructuring costs in the third quarter, bringing the total to-date to $516 million. The remaining work to be done consists primarily of ongoing technology application migrations and the further consolidation of real estate, which will continue through 2021. I want to take a minute and provide an update to our outlook for 2020. our 2020 outlook assumes recessionary conditions persist for the rest of the year. Despite this headwind, we expect RIS to generate underlying revenue growth for the full year offset by a decline in Consulting. at Marsh, we see underlying growth in the low single digits for Q4 and the full year, a solid result in the face of the pandemic. at Guy carpenter, we continue to expect mid single-digit underlying growth for the full year. Guy Carpenter’s fourth quarter could be impacted by difficult comparisons to last year although Q4 is a seasonally small quarter. We continue to expect Mercer’s underlying revenue will decline in the fourth quarter and be down modestly for the full year. Finally, revenue weakness in Oliver Wyman will persist through the fourth quarter. As we learn to live with the virus, we are progressively moving to a more normal course for business decisions. We expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings will be impacted by a sequential uptick in expenses due to a general loosening of spending restrictions, strategic hiring, and costs associated with employee related activity that would have taken place over the course of the year, but was delayed due to the pandemic. Despite this, we are raising our adjusted EPS outlook for the year to mid single-digit growth. In addition, based on this outlook, we expect our overall margin will increase, which would Mark our 13th consecutive year of reported margin expansion. We ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of cash, saw a sequential reduction in outstanding debt and have the entirety of our combined $2.8 billion of credit facilities available. We remain committed to deleveraging and we continue to expect to reduce overall debt this year. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $12.7 billion, down from $13.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, reflecting the repayment of a $500 million one-year term loan ahead of its schedule maturity. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in December when 700 million of senior notes mature. Interest expense in the third quarter was $128 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $127 million of interest expense in the fourth quarter. While uncertainty remains high in the current environment, we feel the actions we have taken to secure additional flexibility along with our strong performance to-date positions us well to continue to navigate the crisis from a liquidity perspective. In line with our prior commentary, we did not repurchase any shares in the third quarter and do not plan to repurchase shares for the remainder of 2020. Uses of cash in the third quarter totaled $295 million and included $59 million for acquisitions, and $236 million for dividends. for the first nine months, uses of cash totaled $1.5 billion and included $753 million for acquisitions and $702 million for dividends. Overall, we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results. We are on track to deliver a solid year, despite the ongoing global pandemic. our results reflect the strength and resilience of our company and our colleagues, and we remain focused on striking the right balance between delivering solid results today while continuing to invest for growth in the future. And with that, I’m happy to turn it back to Dan.
Dan Glaser: Thank you, Mark. and operator, we’re ready to go to the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Mike Zaremski: Thanks. Good morning. I guess I’d love to hear more about parts of the consulting segment. That seems to be the area with a higher level of organic growth uncertainty, where we’re getting most of our questions incoming from investors. You’ll clearly improve margins there in the segment despite negative organic growth. Maybe, you can talk about some things that drove that the sustainability; is there more or less uncertainty in that segment going forward, given the pandemic seems to be causing some shutdowns again in Europe, so a broad question.
Dan Glaser: Yes. Sure, Mike. I’d start by saying; we’re we lucky to have a variety of businesses within Marsh & McLennan. With many consulting, as an example, we’d have businesses which have high degrees of recurring revenues, such as our health business and our investment business parts of our retirement actuarial business as an example. we have other parts of our consulting business like Marsh’s career business and Oliver Wyman, which are more project based. And then project-based work has an awful lot to do with general economic conditions and business confidence. So, it is a natural outcome for us to feel pressure on those businesses in times of recession or in times where there’s a high level of uncertainty, but we can navigate it as a total company and we understand that businesses. they are terrific businesses, market-leading fantastic businesses, and they make the overall company smarter as well. So, from our perspective, it’s the grouping together that matters the most and certainly, businesses that have less recurring revenue and more project work are under more pressure on times like these and that will continue, so that is – we felt it during the financial crisis and we’ll feel it now. Now, the bounce back can be very swift, because as soon as the turn happens and companies get back into business as usual, return to growth type of mode. Then that work picks up. I’m happy to say that both of those businesses are holding up better than during the financial crisis. because in the beginning of this crisis, we weren’t sure whether that would be the case or not and it has turned out that those businesses have proved to be more resilient than they were during the financial crisis. Anything else, Mike?
Mike Zaremski: Yes. I’ll switch gears to property and casualty insurance, rate increase momentum has accelerated. And I think a lot of your clients are seeing double-digit rate increases year-on-year now. for some of the carriers that doesn’t seem to be translating into as much top-line growth as we expected, even taking into account weak exposures. I mean, are you guys seeing more of your clients self-insure and just kind of – are you guys having to do more work there is that impacting your Marsh & McLennan at all? It feels like there’s – the market’s just so tough and challenging in certain places that corporates are – you’re having to help corporates to offset some of the pain per se.
Dan Glaser: Yes. It’s a great question and I’ll hand off to John in a second to address this, because it’s really Marsh question more than a Guy Carpenter one. The Marsh is tough and we’re on the side of the client, and we’re advocating for the client doing the best we can in the circumstances, in some ways, some level of the increases in certain parts of the business, are probably justified based upon loss levels and a soft market environment that has persisted for years. Although we don’t like the speed of the increases, ultimately, I don’t think that benefits the market or benefits our clients, when it snaps back in such a – in times harsh way. particularly, in this kind of environment, where clients, in certain industries, are really feeling a lot of pressure on revenue and survival, and then being hit with large levels of insurance increases, it’s a real tough environment and we’re doing our best for our clients in the circumstances. And John, do you want to add to that?
John Doyle: Sure, Dan. Mike, I think obviously, every transaction’s got the mix of different factors that drive the outcome for our clients. That’s a very, very challenging market for them, especially given the atomic environment. So, we have putting aside the price and exposure aspect of what drives the ultimate premium that gets charged to the client. Some clients are being forced to retain more risk; it’s fewer, but whether it’s through higher retentions or in very, very few circumstances, where we can’t get the limit that we would like, or that our client would like, but with some level of frequency, clients are electing to retain more risks. So, it could be a higher retention. It could be bindless limit in certain cases, for example, in the D&O market, where there is a meaningful amount of stress in the U.S., UK and Australia, in particular, some clients are electing to buy A side only coverage; or where they do buy some B and C cover, they take down the limits, where they do by B and C. And so we obviously work with our clients very, very closely and are working hard to present their risks as best we can to drive the best possible outcome. And the other dynamic I would mention as well is we are seeing an increase in the number of captive formations as well. So, a lot of different strategies, obviously helping our clients navigate the market as best we can.
Mike Zaremski: Thank you. Nice quarter.
John Doyle: Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I guess starting on the revenue outlook within RIS and maybe, I’m zoning in, on Marsh strong results there, I guess, given on the backdrop that you alluded to Dan, in your opening remarks, how do we think about like, do you think the Q2 and the Q3 for that business specifically, I’m talking to Marsh represented the kind of the trough of the slowdown from COVID. I know there’s a lot of obviously uncertainty out there, but when we think about the fourth quarter and into 2021, I know you said that these conditions can persist into the end of 2021, but how should we think about that business specifically? It seems like it’s been pretty resilient and could the Q2 and Q3 be the trough and could we start thinking about things getting better just based off of what you know today?
Dan Glaser: Yes. Okay. So, it’s a terrific question. And I’ll start with it. and then I’ll hand off to John and also Peter, so they can address it in more depth. I’d start by saying we’re thrilled with RIS’s performance and yes, they have proved to be tremendously resilient market leading flight to quality types of attributes and I want to make one point, because fiduciary income is often ignored in the mix here and you just look at RIS’s underlying growth, 3% in the third quarter, rather than 2% and 4% year-to-date if I exclude fiduciary income. the reality is fiduciary income has dropped in half year-to-date, there was $80 million within RIS and now it’s $40 million. So, you look at our performance, not just top-line, but more specifically on the bottom line in overcoming the loss of that fiduciary income and growing through it, it was really an overall terrific performance. Now, getting to your real question is like is the worst over. I have to say it’s really impossible to say. We all want to say it, but it’s impossible to say that it’s only going to get better from here so much depends on COVID and the government response and the economic implications of any government response and so it’s really too early to say that we’re out of the woods. As we mentioned in our remarks, our experts within Oliver Wyman, who advised many governments, et cetera are really thinking that at the earliest, this model returned to what feels like normal, kind of this time next year. And so this is a long haul and we have to be prepared for the long haul. I think that one of the things that we can say, not only as Marsh & McLennan, but also as a society, we are resilient. We are learning. we are adapting and it should get better from here. 2021 should, in a macro basis, get better from here. And as you know, many of the prognosis on 2021 is that recession sometime, second, third quarter of 2021. And so it should be better, but it’s very difficult to call the trough. What I would say is we will grind through and power through any scenario. We will grow our revenue in almost all circumstances faster than we grow our expenses as we’ve done for 12 or 13 years in a row that will continue. But John, why don’t we start with you and then hand over to Peter?
John Doyle: Yes. thanks, Dan. Look, I was pleased with our results. our team is highly focused and I’m very, very proud of them and what are very different circumstances for folks on a personal level, but also in a very, very difficult insurance market. Our U.S. business continues to grow well. Dan mentioned and Mark mentioned that the growth at MMA was very strong. Canada’s performing very well. Our MGA operations at Victor’s, we’re the largest MGA in the world performing quite nicely. internationally, I’m seeing good growth in Asia, in the middle East and Africa as well and a number of different specialties. Some are under pressure, of course, aviation and energy, as you might expect. But FINPRO is growing very well, construction actually, a good quarter for us. We grew nicely in credit lines as well. I mentioned earlier with Mike, some clients are deciding to buy a less insurance, one exception to that is in cyber. So, our cyber business is growing very, very well at the moment and we’re seeing particularly in the U.S. and in the UK, our clients elect to buy more limit there. So, as Dan pointed out, it’s difficult to project where things go, but I’m confident in our ability to perform relatively well. The other point I would make is just we’re as deep and as strong as we’ve ever been from a talent point of view. last year was a big year of change for us bringing JLT and Marsh together. We did a lot of work on our culture and becoming a team, and we weren’t doing it of course, in anticipation of a pandemic, but we really were coming together very, very nicely at a time when our clients need us the most. And so anyway, the teamwork there has been outstanding. Peter?
Dan Glaser: So Peter, I mean, it’s hard to talk about potential trough with you at 6% year-to-date, it is a – that’s a trough, I'll take it, but any comments Peter?
Peter Hearn: Yes. As I’ve said before, we built Guy Carpenter to produce consistent results regardless of the market conditions. And I think we’ve demonstrated that over the past three years, and while Q3 and Q4 tend to be seasonally small and by nature inherently volatile. I couldn’t be more pleased with our flat result given the fact that we had this one-time, multi-year true up from 2019 plus some negative timing. And on a normalized basis, we would have grown 6%. So, when I look at the year, when I look at the environment that we’re operating in, where there’s still a high degree of fear and uncertainty based on both prior years and the unknown relative to COVID-19. I think Guy Carpenter is well positioned. And then as I look at our new business growth for 2020, we’re on track for our fourth year of record, new business growth. So overall, I feel very good of how – where Guy Carpenter is positioned in the market.
Dan Glaser: Thanks. Elyse, any follow-ups?
Elyse Greenspan: Yes. thanks. That was very thorough. My next question is on the margin side, really good margin improvement, given the headwinds as well, 150 basis points in the third quarter overall, 180 year-to-date. Obviously, that’s a function of some JLT saves, some COVID-related savings that you guys have alluded to. I’m just trying to extrapolate this. So, 150 in the Q3, you guys have said margin improvement for the year. So that leaves a bit of a range for the – how the fourth quarter could turn out. just trying to think about the JLT saves, as well as some COVID saves that could persist, like how should we think about kind of the expense profile that there were some one-time items in the third quarter.
Dan Glaser: Yes. it’s another good question. And it’s a fair question, because we’re basically saying we’re at 9% growth of adjusted EPS growth year-to-date and will be mid single digit to the year, but for the year is not in our outlook? So, it sort of says, well, what’s happening in the fourth quarter? So, it’s a fair question. And I would just say, there was some loosening of expense controls in Q3 and we’re going, and that will increase in Q4. We are getting back progressively to a more normal pattern of our business and that will mean that there’ll be more hiring. Hiring is down this year. Our own level of turnover as a company is down relative to the years past. There’ll be some employee related actions as we position ourselves for 2021. And there’s some pent-up demand and some catch-ups that will happen in the fourth quarter, but if you take a step back from this, I just want to say that every company has sort of a natural cadence to both revenue and expense. And as we have demonstrated over many years, we understand that. And so therefore, in every single year, our revenue growth of upward down as we’ve seeded out our expense results. And when I look at our typical level of underlying expense growth, you look at the last five years, four of those five years, then there was 2% expense growth on an annual basis underlying, okay. Including 2% in 2019 and 2% in the first quarter of 2020 claims. So, 2% could be looked at as a natural sort of cadence of expense growth and that’s why we were having really good results over the last couple of years, because we were growing top line at 4% and we were having expense growth at 2% underlying as an overall company. In the second quarter of this year, we went from 2% growth on expense in the first quarter to minus five underlying expense growth in the second quarter. So clearly, we would hold back on discretionary expense and we set a high bar for what was actually necessary and required. in the third quarter, that became the minus four. So that’s going to continue. I’m not going to say whether it’s a minus three, minus two, minus one, it’s probably still going to be a minus, right. So, we are not going to grow expenses in the fourth quarter, year-over-year. But our expense growth will sequentially go up versus the third quarter, which also end up versus the – where we were in the second quarter. So, that’s sound, the right way to look at it from my perspective.
Elyse Greenspan: Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Phil Stefano: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. So Dan, you had talked about in your – I think it was your prepared remarks, the potential for an uptake and expense actions that were delayed throughout the year and just thinking about all the uncertainties that we have in the world. And I think they’re totally understandable and warranted, but what gives you the confidence or the thought to start bringing back expenses and how do we think about the unfolding of catch-up over the next year or two, as we get to whatever normal is in that timeframe?
Dan Glaser: Yes. well, we all exist in the world, right. So at the end, our performance in part will reflect what’s happening with regard to the virus and what’s happening with regards to the general economic environment. I’m not saying that things with the virus are getting materially better. I do think that health outcomes are materially better than they were in the early stages of the virus, because doctors and healthcare professionals have adapted, they’ve learned. And so oftentimes, the results have been better. Hospitalizations are quite, not quite as severe and fatality globally are generally well down. It’s not the make line-up of any illness. I mean, an illness is an illness, but I think more importantly, the world is learning to live with the virus a bit. And so investment decisions are being made thoughts about next year and the year after are being made. The idea that the sun will rise in the future, that is the thought process within companies. And so our feeling is 2021 on a macro basis should be better. It may not be materially better, but it should be better than 2020. And then the other thing is we have now two quarters to look at where we were in this second of this crisis and look how our businesses performed. Our expectations were exceeded on both top and bottom line. Our consulting business held up it is non-recurring parts of it better than our expectations. Our RIS business, both in Marsh and Guy Carpenter have done phenomenally well in the circumstances. And our year-to-date result is very strong. So, that is our all learning from that and adaptability has given us the confidence to step out a little bit and say, okay, let’s – we won’t return fully to normal operations. And we’re still largely remote working, but progressively moving towards something that can feel a little bit more like normal. Like as an example we do performance appraisals every year, near the end of the year. We’re going to do that this year. We’ll do the same thing. And yes, maybe even be a little bit more awkward because it’s over Zoom and everything else like that in terms of having discussions. But it’s important for people to know, they’re either on track or off track doing a great job or not. And so we’re going to continue with that, the more – in more areas than the HR, but really across the piece digital transformation work, where I’m working on further integration activities. We find out this pressing ahead and going forward with some of the things that we delayed in the second and early parts of the third quarter.
Phil Stefano: Got it. Thank you. And thinking about the out-performance at least based on our expectations for RIS and organic, I was hoping you could just help us think about, the economic benefit versus maybe what we feared a couple of months ago versus potential implications from two of your larger competitors going through a merger and any benefits that that may have?
Dan Glaser: Yes. I mean, in terms of, as I indicated in my initial remarks, our performance this year has been nothing short of outstanding. And that, and I’m saying that as a total company, RIS maybe in particular for total company, I mean, the protection of shareholders in the Consultant segment in a year where they’re challenged on the top line is remarkable and appreciated, and we’re continuing to execute well through Mercer and Oliver Wyman. So, I think as an overall company, like I said, it’s nothing short of outstanding. In terms of our competitors that we’re running our own, right. And we are focused on serving clients like never before they need us now, more than ever before, and supporting our colleagues in, standing up for each other. We wouldn’t trade our strategic positioning with anyone. And we believe that we will benefit from consolidation as clients and industry professionals consider their options in the future. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So, I have a couple of questions along the same lines of the discussion earlier. But any comments on the project pipeline at Mercer and Oliver Wyman? I think you mentioned you expect negative organic growth in 4Q, but based on what you’re seeing have these businesses bottomed already, or it’s hard to say given the uncertainty in the market?
Dan Glaser: That’s impossible to say in the uncertainty. I think we have to bear in mind that Mercer and Oliver Wyman are quite different in terms of their client segment. A part of Mercer and Martine can add more, more details to it. A part of Mercer in the career business is project related work, so in that way, similar to Oliver Wyman, which is almost all project related work. But a good chunk of Mercer has recurring revenue in a similar way to RIS and so it’s not quite as exposed to project work and the vagaries of the economic environment as Oliver Wyman is. So let me, let me hand off the first Martine, and then Scott, to talk a little bit about outlook and project pipeline, but I’ll start by saying we’re not highly uncertain environment. And so therefore, it’s impossible to say anything definitively at this stage in terms of trough or where we go from here, but Martine?
Martine Ferland: Yes. Thank you, Dan. Absolutely. So, as you said, career as for us is the unit that has the most discretionary project. So, we’ve seen a reduced demand there and some of the regular rewards and consulting work, but at the same time, we were able to help clients with their workforce model, their return to work, their reinvention, the transformation. It’s very exposed to the economic conditions though. So, we’re pleased to see that we had a better Q3, than Q2, but we cannot say whether the outcome what it will be because of course, it’s very related to the conditions out there and as we’re seeing lock downs continuing. If I pivot to health, for example, we’ve had aspects of our health business and has been super resilient. There’s been lots of demand for digital health, such as our Darwin platform solution voluntary benefit support from a health wellness and mental health issues and delights. But there’s a part of our health business, that’s also related to the head counts at our clients. And therefore, depending on the level of lay off that we say, we see some headwinds in that way. Although so far for 2020, it’s not been too severe. And finally on the wealth business, there’s a large part of the wealth business that is regulatory work that is recurring. So it can be resilient. We’ve had a little bit less of project work as the markets calmed down in Q3 versus the first half of the year, but the very bright spot is our OCIO business. So our implemented asset business we’ve seen improved capital market performance in Q3, but also very strong net inflows. And we had a very similar pattern during the global financial crisis where when you see volatility, uncertainty on the market, the client wants strong governance, agility and then transaction of assets, and a slight to quality. So, we’re seeing very strong inflows and very strong pipeline building in that business. So, that’s for Mercer.
Dan Glaser: Thank you. Thank you. Then in the financial crisis, Oliver Wyman decline six quarters in a row, including two quarters at 19%. So, at the end, this has been far more manageable than during the financial crisis, but Scott, you want to talk about your pipeline?
Scott McDonald: Sure, I’ll try and give you some color, Jimmy. As you know, in the second quarter, we had a pretty severe contraction in revenues, not as bad as the financial crisis, but like most times of stress, it was really driven by our clients focusing on just immediate emergency issues as they dealt with the severity of the pandemic. But throughout, I’d say the back end of Q2 and Q3 we’ve shifted our portfolio to services to help clients manage the crisis. Think about the future, a strategic and operational challenges they’ve faced. And it’s been a really fruitful shift for us and recent sales have been very strong. We think, we’re improving our competitive position and we feel pretty good out there with our clients, but we do need the global economy to get back on track. We need business confidence to remain solid. And if that happens, there’s no reason we can’t get back to our historical growth rates sometime next year.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thank you. And just on your reluctance on share buybacks this year. Not that you buy back a lot, but you have bought back some stock each of the last several years. So, what’s the reason – and the results have actually been better than expected this year. So, what’s the rationale or reasoning behind not buying back? Is it the macro stocks’ valuation like deals? Any insight into that.
Dan Glaser: Sure. Let, me hand over to Mark McGivney. So, Mark?
Mark McGivney: Sure. Hey Jimmy. I actually, the whole cash generation capital management story this year has been a great one for us. Remember back to some of the guidance we gave earlier in the year about capital deployment. We’re largely on track despite the pandemic with those plans. And if you remember coming into the year, the priority for dividend, acquisitions and the big chunk of the leveraging, and as I said, we’re largely on track with all of those. So, we raised our dividend. We’ve got a very active year for M&A, but despite the pandemic, as Dan said earlier, I think it’s actually remarkable as an M&A biggest year in terms of deal value and revenue acquired. So, we’ve been active on the M&A and a front, and we’re still committed to de-leveraging this was going to be a big year of debt paid down. And that’s really what you’re going to see in the fourth quarter. And we may actually see a little bit more M&A activity in the fourth quarter. So coming into the year, we didn’t say share repurchase was going to be that much in the cards and we’re coming in very consistent with the original plans coming into the year.
Dan Glaser: So that would bring us back into the future to our more balanced approach for capital management, where, as we’ve said to you before, dividends are priority dividend, relative to priority, we’ve put acquisitions ahead of share repurchase and we put share repurchase ahead of building cash on the balance sheet. So, 2021 may be a more normal pattern for us where you see more of a balanced approach.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. Good morning. I don’t know if I’m overthinking this, but if you’re expecting full year organic growth to be flat overall, this might imply that the fourth quarter would have to be worse than the third quarter?
Dan Glaser: I mean, I think what we were giving you our outlook on that top line, we’re basically saying, Oliver Wyman will remain under pressure. The Mercer will have the amount of supplies for the year and probably the quarter. So Mercer is continuing in the category of around low single digit negative growth. And that Marsh and Guy Carpenter will grow in the fourth quarter. In total, the Carpenter would feel more pressure, but RIS as a segment would grow. So, I wouldn’t jump to the conclusion that the top line all that different than what we’ve been operating. What we did point to is that our significant levels of expense reduction that we’ve seen in the second quarter. And sequentially a little bit less expense reduction in the third quarter will be less expense reduction in the fourth quarter. And so our expenses will rise at a faster pace than, than what it has in the rest of the year, but we still expect our expense growth in the fourth quarter to be a negative number.
Meyer Shields: Okay. No, that’s helpful. Understood. One of the things Dan that you mentioned early in the call was strategic hires as an example of recovering expenses. And I was hoping it good talk about that a little bit, if in terms of the context of what, in terms of – I’m sorry, in terms of whether that will be something big enough for us to notice from our perspective on the outside.
Dan Glaser: It’s not going to be big enough to notice in our expense base. I mean, you look at it, we’ve got nearly 8,000 people around the world, and if you take a normal year, you’re probably looking at about 10% colleague turnover, which means that 8,000 people that are going to be coming into the organization in any given year. So, even if we have significant levels of strategic hiring, strategic recruitment we would absorb it in our regular expense space. So, you’re not going to see a pop and expenses as a result of that. I mean, in an odd quarter, you might, but over the course of a year, it wouldn’t turn up.
Meyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you, good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess my first question is just trying to connect some of the dots, expenses are down nicely this year. It sounds like you still expect some revenue pressure in 2021. Just, as we’re still dealing with a COVID environment. I would think that would potentially create some expense pressure year-over-year into 2021. And clearly you’ve managed expenses very, very well over the years. So, I guess, how do you deal with that particular year-over-year pressure going on to next year?
Dan Glaser: I mean, all first of all, expense growth is a function of revenue growth. We expect our margins to be up in 2021 for the 14th consecutive year. We expect 2021 to be a decent year relative to 2020, because the general economic environment should be better and there should be better health outcomes as well. So, as I mentioned, were learning to live with the virus more. And from that perspective, time is our friend a little bit. So, I’m optimistic. I think we’re all optimistic about 2021, and performance and we’ll control our expense base, revenue within the overall company. We look at RIS is having large amounts of non-recurring revenue, great strategic positioning. At some point Consulting will come back strong, whether it’s 2021 or not, it’s too early get out. It’s certainly not going to be early in 2021 that we’ve see a massive bounce back because of the overall environment, but we’re optimistic. I mean, I look at this year, we’ve done better on the top line and bottom line than expected gives us a great foundation. We’re working now to position ourselves for a good 2021 and we’re ready to get to it.
Yaron Kinar: Got it. And then my second question is specific to Marsh. If I look sequentially in first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, what are you seeing in terms of overall retention rates and overall new business generation? Are you seeing improvement of the new business, maybe improving retention rates any color you can offer on that would be helpful?
Dan Glaser: Sure. I’ll hand off to John. John, want to dig in there?
John Doyle: Sure. Client retention is a very strong, it’s been, been strong throughout the entire year and it’s better than prior year. We had a very strong new business quarter in the first quarter. So, we got off to a very good start to the year, and in the second and third quarter new businesses down slightly year-over-year. But again, given the external environment very, very pleased with the outcome, and it’s not down across the board. So, for example, MMA grew its new business nicely in the third quarter. So, I’m encouraged by how we’re navigating the economic challenges.
Yaron Kinar: And I guess specifically though on sequential changes, because I get that year-over-year, it’s going to be, you’re going to face some pressures, but I’m just curious as how it’s developing sequentially?
John Doyle: I don’t have those numbers in front of me, but there – our quarters aren’t even throughout the course of the year. So, I do think the year-over-year is an important metric. Clearly, where we’ve seen more stress on the new business front is in a couple of areas, right? It’s – as you I’m sure would expect construction, infrastructure related things, transaction risk rep and warranty type business where the economic slowdown led to left lesser output and less opportunity for us. But again, I think there’s a flight to quality in the more recurring business. We’ve seen a pickup of late.
Dan Glaser: I also think the way to look at it Yaron is, that new business is relative to other companies, very soft. It’s just not as strong as it was last year, given the overall environment, but still the amount of new business that Marsh is winning is significant. I think that’s our…
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies for any closing remarks.
Dan Glaser: So thank you for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our 76,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication as we work through these challenging times. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. I look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-30 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Second quarter 2020 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's Web site at www.mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements, including certain expectations related to COVID-19 and other matters. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our Earnings Release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC Web site. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures. Please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Dan Glaser: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. I am pleased with our second quarter results which demonstrates Marsh & McLennan's strength and resiliency as we navigate the current global health crisis and economic recession. The world is experiencing too dramatic and uncertain, unforeseen events at the same time. First, the global pandemic and second, the global economic crisis driven by an unprecedented simultaneous lockdown in almost every part of the world. In addition, society reached the breaking point on racial inequalities which has persisted for far too long. In the face of this extraordinary combination of events, Marsh & McLennan colleagues rose to the occasion and continued to serve our clients with excellence and distinction. I want to thank our 76,000 colleagues globally and our leadership team for their dedication and outstanding execution in these challenging times. While the impact to our business from the economic downturn and health crisis so far has been manageable, we live in troubled times and the conditions in many parts of the world remain extremely difficult and uncertain. The world may have avoided the worst case health and economic scenarios, but this downturn may be longer than many initially expected, when ways of viruses resurgence in certain geographies. While in most parts of the world we are through the initial phase of peak fear and uncertainty around health outcomes. We are now in a period of dealing with the economic fallout and living with the continuing health implications. These economic and health uncertainties could last a year or longer, challenging companies well into 2021. Regardless of the shape of the recovery, we have proven our businesses resilience, we have strong control over our expense space and the need for our advice and solutions is now more critical than ever. Our management team has made a number of tough calls and I believe the right ones as we navigated through these first months of the crisis. We continue to take actions that balance the short-term with a focus on positioning for the long-term. These include maintain jobs in the thick of the pandemic, as well as proceeding with our annual salary increases, avoiding a hiring freeze and continuing to make strategic hires in the face of industry dislocation. And moving forward with several acquisitions so far this year in MMA as we continue to pursue inorganic growth. We've cut back significantly on discretionary expenses and have set a high bar for what is deemed essential spending, which is driven costs down while we preserve jobs and salaries. We also enhanced our liquidity by establishing a new credit facility and issuing additional long-term debt. Looking beyond the current crisis, I believe we will emerge as a stronger firm. Our organization has never been flatter, faster and better connected than it is today. I want to pause and comment on racial inequality. The racial inequality in our society is a pervasive issue that recently came to a breaking point with the tragic death of George Floyd. Systemic racism has caused inequities, injustice, healthcare, education, careers, wealth, creation and freedom. The recent events have been shocking to me and all too familiar to others. Our executive committee has been fully engaged, listening to our black colleagues and others, speaking up alongside them and implementing concrete actions to make a difference. We are determined to seize this moment to create a more diverse and inclusive company. In these dynamic times, we are pressing to develop new solutions to address rising and evolving risk globally. Our businesses are collaborating more than ever to bring the power of our firm to clients. For example, [Washington Carpenter] [ph] leading the industry to create a new market for pandemic insurance. We initiated a dialogue in Congress in late March to create a public private partnership for pandemic risk, which would facilitate future economic recovery and enhance resiliency among companies going forward. We are also developing public private pandemic solutions in multiple countries. And I was wondering we developed a leading disease progression model, Pandemic Navigator, which is being used by governments and companies to predict virus spreads and guide decisions. Both Oliver Wyman and Mercer are advising clients across a number of industries utilizing Pandemic Navigator to make returns to office plans, understand future demands recovery patterns, manage supply chains for cash credit losses and assess early warning signals. Mercer and Marshall's consulting have also joined forces to work with employers on their new normal strategies. Helping clients use this time as an opportunity to adapt, reinvent and become more resilient. In summary, I am proud of how our company continues to innovate while responding to the immediate pressures caused by the crisis. Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance market conditions. P&C insurance pricing continues to accelerate. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index increased 19% year-over-year versus 14% in the first quarter and 11% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Global property insurance was up 19% and global financial and professional lives were up 37%, while global casualty rates are up 7% on average. Keep in mind, our index used a large account business where we typically earned fees. However, U.S. small and middle market insurance pricing is up meaningfully as well, although not to the same magnitude as large complex accounts. Overall, underwriters continue to push for higher levels of rate increases as a result of social inflation pressures, persistently low yields and a number of large underwriting losses including COVID-19. This is before the peak of the hurricane season. While capital remains adequate, the risk appetite of insurers is reduced as they are increasingly cautious in uncertain environment. Turning to reinsurance, the mid-year renewals which are largely focused on southeast U.S. wind exposure saw a meaningful rate increases. Florida peak zone property catastrophe reinsurance programs were up 25% to 35%. These are some of the highest rate increases seen since 2012. Non-Florida mid-year renewals would typically applies to 15%. Reinsurers are being cautious regarding the amount of capital they are currently willing to expose in an environment of great uncertainty. Overall, global P&C insurance and reinsurance markets remain challenging with accelerating price increases and narrowing terms and conditions. It is in times like these where our experienced advice and solutions are even more critical. Now, let me turn to our second quarter financial performance. We delivered excellent adjusted EPS growth of 12%, despite the global impact of COVID-19. Our strong EPS growth in the quarter reflects great execution on the part of our colleagues, the immediate benefit of expense management actions and the delayed impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our revenue. Total revenue was 4.2 billion down 4% or down 2% on an underlying basis, underlying revenue grew 2% in our RIS and declined 6% in consulting. In risk and insurance services second quarter revenue was 2.6 billion, an increase of 1%. Underlying revenue growth was up 2% in the quarter reflecting strong 9% growth at Guy Carpenter and 1% in Marsh, excluding a reduction in revenue we booked in the quarter related to estimated exposure declines, underlying revenue in both RIS and Marsh was up 3% in the quarter, which is a strong result in the face of the economic downturn. RIS adjusted operating income increased 19% to 752 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 430 basis points versus a year ago. In consulting, second quarter revenue was 1.6 billion, underlying revenue declined by 6% for the quarter. Oliver Wyman and Mercer's career business saw the greatest impact on the lockdown as expected. Consulting adjusted operating income declined by 13% and the adjusted margin declined by 70 basis points versus a year ago. Overall adjusted operating income increased 10% versus a year ago to 984 million. Our adjusted operating margin increased 270 basis points to 25.5%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 12% versus a year ago to $1.32 cents reflecting expense tightening and strong execution. Even though COVID-19 will impact our results for the remainder of the year, our strong second quarter performance is evidence that our business is resilient and that we are able to manage through challenging environments. While our year-to-date results are strong, the economic outlook is weak and uncertainty is still very high. For the full year 2020, we continue to expect a modest decline in underlying revenue. However, given our strong second quarter performance, we now expect to generate modest growth and adjusted for the full year, despite the decline in underlying revenue. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, Dan, and good morning. We're pleased with our second quarter results, despite a modest decline in revenues driven by the current crisis; we delivered strong earnings and continue to enhance our balance sheet and liquidity position. Overall, revenue declined 4% in the second quarter to 4.2 billion or down 2% on an underlying basis. Operating income in the quarter was 885 million, an increase of 30% over last year. Adjusted operating income increased 10% to 984 million and our adjusted margin increased 270 basis points to 25.5%. GAAP EPS was $1.12 in the quarter and adjusted EPS increased 12% to $1.32. For the first six months of 2020, underlying revenue growth was 2%, our adjusted operating income grew 13% to 2.2 billion, our adjusted margin increased 190 basis points and our adjusted EPS increased 10% to $2.96. Before I go deeper into our results, I want to discuss a $36 million reduction to previously recorded revenue we booked in the quarter. This adjustment reflects the estimated impact of the economic downturn on exposure units. It primarily impacted Marsh, but there was also a reduction in Mercer in health. A significant portion of brokerage revenue is recognized at policy inception including in some cases where ultimate revenue is uncertain. In these cases, premiums and commissions are recorded based on estimates of ultimate exposure. These estimates are typically not updated until the end of the policy term as variability in most cases is models. However, due to the impact of COVID-19 and the economic downturn, exposures in many lines of business will likely be lower than originally anticipated, requiring that we update our estimates sooner. It is important to note that this charge is included in underlying growth and adjusted earnings. Returning to results in risk and insurance services, second quarter revenue was 2.6 billion with underlying growth of 2% or 3% excluding the revenue adjustment. A decline in fiduciary interest income was also a 70 basis point drag on underlying revenue. Operating income increased 34% to 696 million. Adjusted operating income increased 19% to 762 million and the adjusted margin expanded 430 basis points to 32.1%. For the first six months of the year revenue was 5.5 billion with underlying growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income for the first half of the year increased 20% to 1.7 billion, with a margin of 33.4% up 280 basis points from the same period a year ago. In Marsh revenue in the quarter was 2.2 billion, an increase of 1% on an underlying basis, or 3%, excluding the impact of the revenue adjustment, a strong result in the current environment. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 3% in the quarter, in the international division underlying growth was flat with EMEA down 3%, Asia Pacific up 4% and Latin America up 4%. For the first six months of the year Marsh's revenue was 4.2 billion with underlying growth of 3%. U.S. and Canada underlying growth was 4% and international was up 2%. Guy Carpenter had another great quarter revenue was 433 million reflecting underlying growth of 9%. Growth was driven by solid retention, strong demand driving new business and a tailwind from the current pricing environment. For the first six months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated 1.3 billion of revenue and 8% underlying growth. In the consulting segment, underlying revenue declined 6% in the quarter reflecting the impact of the current crisis, operating income decreased 8% to 255 million. Adjusted operating income decreased 13% to 265 million and the adjusted margin decreased 78 basis points to 17.3%. Consulting generated revenue of 3.4 billion for the first six months of 2020 representing an underlying decline of 1%. Adjusted operating income for the first half of the year was down 7% to 554 million. Mercer's revenue was 1.1 billion in the quarter down 3% on an underlying basis. Wealth underlying revenue declined 2% reflecting modest growth and defined benefits offset by a decline in investment management solutions. Our assets under management were approximately 306 billion at the end of the second quarter up 8% year-over-year. Health increased 1% on an underlying basis in the quarter or 2%, excluding the impact of the revenue adjustments. In career underlying revenue declined 16%, careers where we have more discretionary projects business which drove the revenue decline. The first six months of the year revenue at Mercer was 2.4 billion with 1% underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue was 467 million in the quarter a decline of 13% on an underlying basis, which was better than we expected coming into the quarter. For the first six months of the year revenue with Oliver Wyman was 978 million a decline of 7% on an underlying basis. Adjusted corporate expense was 43 million in the quarter. Based on our current outlook, we expect approximately 96 million in total for the second half of the year. [Indiscernible] investment income on an adjusted basis, we had an investment loss of 7 million in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, we reported an investment loss of 31 million primarily driven by the sale of a portion of our equity ownership in Alexander Forbes. Foreign exchange was neutral to EPS in the quarter assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we would expect FX to have a minimal impact on EPS for the remainder of the year. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 25%, compared with 25.9% in the second quarter last year. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%. Through the first half of the year, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24% compared with 24.1% last year. Based on the current environment and continue to expect a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2020, excluding discrete items. The most challenging parts of the JLT integration are now well behind us as demonstrated by our strong first half results. We are on plan or ahead of schedule on all of our key milestones, including cost savings and restructuring actions. We incurred 57 million of JLT integration and restructuring costs in the second quarter, bringing the total to-date to 472 million. In total, we still expect to incur approximately 625 million of cash costs and 75 million of non-cash cost to generate at least 350 million of savings. We expect the majority of these costs will be incurred in the savings achieved by the end of 2020. I want to take a minute and provide an update to our outlook for this year. Our revised view contemplates recessionary conditions persisting through at least the remainder of 2020. But it goes without saying that uncertainty remains very high and conditions could turn out materially different than our assumptions, which would affect our projections. For the full year 2020, as Dan mentioned, we now expect to generate modest EPS growth, despite our outlook for a modest decline in underlying revenue. We currently expect adjusted EPS to decline in the back half of the year reflecting the full impact of the pandemic on revenue as well as some rebound in spending in certain areas. At Marsh, we still see the potential for modest underlying revenue growth for the year although the back half will be challenging. For the full year 2020, we continue to expect mid-single digit growth at Guy Carpenter. Underlying revenue growth for the second half of the year will likely be more muted, but these are seasonally small quarters for Guy Carpenter. Also keep in mind that Guy Carpenter faces a difficult year-over-year comparison in the third quarter, which as we mentioned last year, benefited from a $17 million true up of a multi-year contract. We continue to expect Mercer's underlying revenue will decline for the remainder of the year and be down modestly for the full year. Finally, revenue weakness in Oliver Wyman could persist through the back half of the year. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with 1.7 billion of cash, a sequential reduction in outstanding debt in the entirety of our combined 2.8 billion of credit facilities available. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have taken prudent steps to enhance our financial resources and flexibility. In April, we secured a new $1 billion line of credit and in May issued 750 million of 10 years senior notes at a coupon of 2.25%. We remain committed to deleveraging and expect to reduce debt this year, although the ultimate amount will depend on our cash generation in the current environment. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was 13.2 billion down from 13.6 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing a reduction of 439 million. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in December 2020, when 700 million of senior notes mature. We also have a $500 million term loan due in January 2021. Interest expense in the second quarter was 132 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately 131 million of interest expense in the third quarter. Although uncertainty in our outlook remains high, we feel comfortable that we have the resources and flexibility to manage through the crisis from a liquidity perspective. In line with our commentary on the first quarter call, we did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter. Given the ongoing uncertainty of the current environment, we do not plan to repurchase shares for the remainder of 2020. Earlier this month, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.465 per share. This increase represents the 11th consecutive year of dividend increases at Marsh & McLennan. Uses of cash in the second quarter totaled 684 million and included 450 million for acquisitions and 234 million for dividends. For the first six months, uses of cash totaled 1.2 billion and included 694 million for acquisitions and 466 million for dividends. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2020. We've shown resiliency, the level of commitment and execution throughout the organization has been outstanding. And while the crisis is far from over, we believe we are positioned to continue to navigate it well. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are ready to begin the Q&A.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank.
Phil Stefano: Dan, in your opening remarks, you talked about the immediate benefit of expense action with the delayed impact of revenue from COVID. And it feels like in the second quarter results, it was most clearly seen on the margin in brokerage. Something you could dig a little more into that and maybe help us understand what drove the expansion in the second quarter and then as we think about the next couple quarters, or even year or two, do the hard decisions, can they be dialed back? How do you think about managing the expenses versus maybe what your revenue expectations are at this point?
Dan Glaser: Sure, sure. So it's a good question. I'd start by saying let's look at the overall macro environment a bit. I mean, it may not feel like it, but so far the world has avoided the worst case health and economic scenarios. I mean, we're still in the early days, the economic downturn may last longer, since there were likely be waves of virus resurgence. So, when we were doing all of our scenario planning and stress testing, very early stages of the health elements of the crisis, you could imagine a lot of -- very forward scenarios, right? And it's certainly not a rosy picture from here. But some of the worst case scenarios appear to have been avoided. And so we pulled back our expenses very quickly. We're a company that believes in distributed leadership, we put a lot of authority out in the field with our leaders in countries and in specialty divisions, et cetera. But there are times where you need to pull that authority back and I have to say the executive committee and I move very quickly to essentially control the expense base of the company set a very high bar for what essential expenses were, and then, pull back heavily on other items. Not only the things that naturally fall away like T&E, but over time camps, contractors slowing down hiring, not a hiring freeze, but slowing down the pace of our hiring and focusing it on revenue producing type of positions. I'm very proud of the notion that that we and the team decided that not only to preserve jobs in the thick of the pandemic, but also we did not cut salaries. Now you may notice that our overall confidence then absolute number is down a bit. And that's because the broad category of [comp] [ph] also includes some things like over time and sales plans and some contractors and some of our variable plans et cetera. I feel pretty good about, how quickly we were able to dial back expenses. And there is a bit of a lag in terms of how revenue headwind actually turns off. Clearly, we had some good pipeline, you looked at our first quarter results, 5% underlying growth overall. So we had nice momentum and some of that momentum carried into the early parts of the second quarter and that goes away. And so we'll have a little bit more revenue pressure. And also because the worst case scenarios are unlikely to occur on either health or economy, type of macro factors we will ease up dramatically but will ease up a bit, will become a little bit more open to the other levels of investment that we could make. And so when we look at the second half of the year, there's still a great deal of uncertainty. We think that delivering reasonable financial results in the context of the crisis, while continuing to invest in future growth is the right position for us to be in.
Phil Stefano: I understand. My follow up would be based on the actions you've seen and how the world has unfolded at least as far as I appreciate, it's early days. Last quarter, we're talking about maybe the sustainability of some of these things. Do you have any thoughts you can put around the actions you took it were hard at first, but maybe feel like the benefit could be something that -- once COVID is comfortably in the rear view?
Dan Glaser: Yes. I mean, there are certainly certain things I mean, we've been able to demonstrate that we can do placement activity and manage client deliverables on a remote basis now, it's not ideal in all circumstances, but it is pretty ideal in some circumstances. So I'm not sure we'll go running back to hopping on an airplane to go to Singapore for a $100,000 opportunity. Maybe it will be a little bit more cautious about the T&E type of spending some while ago come back, it may not return to previous levels for a long time, and maybe never. Flexible work arrangement is another item we won't see a benefit to our real estate, footprints or our real estate costs for a while because of social distancing type of requirements. But over time, could we envision more of a hybrid type of operation where colleagues come to the office and also work from home sometimes during the week and so we can go to much more of an agile workplace in many, many locations. Yes, it's probably likely. I also think that there'll be more digital. I mean, it's important to know while we slowed down our CapEx a little bit in the second quarter, actually through six months CapEx is higher than it was last year and it's because we're continuing to invest in our business. And I think that those items are things that would persist. I also I can't underestimate or the notion of how this crisis has brought the firm together. Crisis can bring out the worst in you or the best in you. And I tell you, Marsh & McLennan has risen and we have never been more collaborative and connected than we are today.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.
Mike Zaremski: First question, maybe focusing more on the consulting segment [since S4] [ph], I think investors are asking the most questions about. Dan, you said you guys have fortunately, I think maybe we all fortunately have avoided the worst case scenarios so far. Does that hold true for kind of what you all were thinking might happen to organic revenues in the overall consulting segment? Clearly they were down but maybe not down as much as at least the consensus expected and maybe you can kind of give us some updates on what you're seeing and hearing in the consulting segments relative to your thoughts last quarter?
Dan Glaser: Sure. I mean, we were pleased with consultings overall performance on organic growth. We clearly expected decline in revenue and pressure, particularly in the project related businesses. Oliver Wyman is almost purely a project business and some parts of Mercer, like the career business is very project oriented and projects tend to be discretionary in the eyes of clients. And so, I think overall a minus 6% is a good result in the circumstances within our consulting business. And both of our main businesses and consulting Mercer and OW have done a nice job protecting shareholders by really focusing on discretionary expenses within our own shop and pulling that back. I mean, every crisis is different in a lot of ways this crisis is more concerning than the global financial crisis. But when you look at the global financial crisis, Mercer was down, 4% in 2009; Oliver Wyman was actually down a bit in 2008 and more significantly in 2009 and had six quarters in a row of contraction. And so we're resilient firm, we can operate as an overall firm on that basis. And the bounce back in 2010, for Mercer and Oliver Wyman was quite good. And we would expect something similar. If there is a lack of discretionary projects on companies, it doesn't mean that they don't need those projects and that they don't want to focus on their future growth and their future ways to be more efficient and we're a go to company for them across people issues and strategy issues. And so we feel good about the consulting business. It could have been worse. And when we looked at it, I think we're in decent shape. I don't know what the second half brings. At the end, we've indicated that we think Mercer will be modestly down for the year. They had a very nice first quarter, but overall for the year, we expect them to be modestly down. And Oliver Wyman, as I said many times before, has a little bit more volatility to quarterly results than any of our other businesses. But we're well positioned and we feel pretty good about where we ended up on the bottom line in both of those areas of the company.
Mike Zaremski: Okay, understood. That's helpful. Lastly, the dollars moved a lot. I'm not sure, Mark, could you talk about FX and whether you should be thinking about it having an impact going forward?
Dan Glaser: Well, thanks, Mike. Mark, you want to take that?
Mark McGivney: Sure. Yes. The FX was not much of a story for EPS in the second quarter as we looked at the back half of the year we don't expect much impact, if rates stay where they are much impact for the balance of the year to EPS.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.
Jimmy Bhullar: I had a question on the reinsurances, that's Guy Carpenter. I think you imply the slowdown in growth in the second half in your comments. How much of that is just comps getting more difficult versus maybe exposures declining? And what's the interplay with pricing getting better, if they are possible like, are you being overly conservative or are you actually being some headwinds to growth given comps and exposures?
Dan Glaser: Sure. I mean, at the end we're not trying to be overly conservative, but we also always want to be realistic and transparent with our investor base. And so a lot of this is Carpenter, the third and fourth quarter are much smaller and so therefore the hard account or two could swing things in different directions. And as we pointed out in our remarks, there was a one off last year that we acknowledged last year $17 million a tall hill to overcome. But, Peter, you want to talk a little bit about either where you see exposure rates and whether this is overly conservative or not?
Peter Hearn: Thank you, Dan. Jimmy, I would just reiterate what Dan says, Q3 and Q4 are historically small quarters and they're subject to volatility with the movement of business from one quarter to the next or timing. From a new business standpoint, our new business growth has been strong for the past three years and we anticipate the same thing in Q3 and Q4. But again, we have tough comparables from Q3 and Q4 of last year, but we've seen no diminution in revenue bases in buying habits. And we've done over several hundred stress tests on client balance sheets to anticipate what the rest of the year could look like from catastrophic events or an adverse situation with regard to COVID-19. So we're winning new mandates on a regular basis. I feel good about where we are for the year and as both Mark and Dan said, they're small volatile quarters and subject to change, but there's been no overarching issue that we've seen with exposure basis in revenue.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And there's been some concern among investors about E&O exposure or negligence related lawsuits against brokers. Do you have anything that you can sort of what are your views on -- what your exposure might be and any sort of quantification of what your retention would be if you were to see something because I'm assuming you've got insurance on that as well. So --
Dan Glaser: Yes. I mean, we haven't publicly disclosed the details of our E&O insurance program, so I'm not going to do it here. Our goal and our principal focus as a broker is to advocate forcefully for policyholders. We do that by obtaining flood coverages and in the event, they have a claim, we do our best to a system with recoveries and we've got very strong risk management practices, high level of professional standards, E&O training of thousands of colleagues. So at the end, it's not something that we spend a lot of time on. Obviously, there's some coverage disputes that are occurring between clients who may believe that they have some coverage within some of their policies related to COVID. And some of those clients, may end up suing everybody but that really hasn't occurred yet. And I'm not overly concerned with it. I think we have good systems and control. Frankly, just like it would be impossible today and why public private partnerships are being talked about broad scale of pandemic insurance is not insurable. It goes into the trillions of dollars of potential exposure and so on. On that basis, it's not like that every client could have gotten full scale broad pandemic protection because there's not a market for it, it had to be targeted, limited in certain industries, certain clients and very expensive.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.
Yaron Kinar: First question on free cash flows, seem like they were very strong, this quarter was curious, what drove that? I think one of your competitors have talked about CARES Act, pushing tax payments back a little bit, but any color you can offer on that. And how to think about cash flows maybe for the rest of the year too?
Dan Glaser: Sure, sure. Mark, you want to take that?
Mark McGivney: Yes. Cash generation in the quarter was strong as you said, we're obviously pleased with that. Here a number of factors contributed, the most important of which was just the strong earnings growth. So we had solid earnings growth. So that was a big factor in driving free cash flow and then there's a number of other factors, so less spending on JLT related items. If you compare it with last year, we got nicked a little bit more by FX than we did this year. And then, in any given quarter there can be fluctuation in some of the balance sheet accounts and working capital that can affect cash flows and we had good results on that front. And so whether it's the quarter year-to-date, our cash generation was strong. For the remainder of the year, it really is going to be about how our earnings trend.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. And then with regards to exposure or the impact of exposure declines, I just want to make sure I was thinking about it correctly. So in consulting fee, the impact tends to be more immediate. And then, RIS, it takes -- there's a bit more of a lag, is that a fair summation?
Dan Glaser: Most of the exposures of clients were actually in Marsh. So I'll hand off to john and he can describe a little bit the types of areas where you would see exposure and decline. It's more mild and consulting and generally around the health business if you're looking at employment as an example, as a proxy for the lives covered under plan, if employment is down and then the anticipated amount of premium would be down because there is a lot of slide. John, you want to talk about exposure units within the large world because that's where most of the adjustment took place.
John Doyle: Sure. As Mark talked about earlier on the call, a number of different products are adjustable and exposed to the unit driven. So, some of the industry groups, marine, aviation, energy, for example, we accept make an adjustment to accrue for [indiscernible] unit over the course of the policy period. Product lines that are more impacted, commercial auto of course, were calm, transaction risk, those kinds of things. So, obviously, overall, our growth historically is correlated the economic growth and construction flows down, other investment flows down there is a bit of a lag effect. And then, so, that impacts our ability to write new business but we also attempted to make an adjustment prior period for adjustable policies.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: My first question is on the full year EPS side. So you guys took that off for modest growth, whereas before, right, it was kind of maybe slightly negative to just about positive depending on what happened to organic for the full year. But if I think about that you guys printed just under 10% EPS growth in the first half of the year, which implies about a mid-single digit decline in the back half, which probably would have been -- where we would have been in your [prior guy] [ph] just for the second half of the year. So I guess I'm trying to package all of the comments together on -- your outlets does seem like it's better although still cautious for the second half of the year. So I think that would come together in that EPS guide, or is it something to do with timing of JLT expenses that were more pronounced in the second quarter? Just trying to understand why that EPS outlook for the second half of the year, isn't perhaps stronger than what you thought it was three months ago?
Dan Glaser: Sure. It's a fair question. And so let me address it this way. Leading the business and as our business leaders within the company do every day, is as much art as it is science. We can make the margin go up at any point in time, by drawing back expenses, by being very tough on rehiring by just pulling it off horns a great deal. The art is figuring out what should we deliver today while we're investing for the future, while we're going to position the company to emerge stronger. And so from that standpoint, the way we look at that, is yes, our second quarter performance was really terrific. But the reality is, we pulled the expense levers hard. And we felt the immediate benefit of that lower spending and the revenue came in a bit higher since there's a lag in the full revenue headwind since all the activity that's pre-COVID in terms of projects still benefited us in the second quarter. So you've got to think the revenue headwind will be a bit stiffer in the second half of the year. And because our worst case scenarios are not going we do not anticipate though the macro environment to go into the worst case scenarios will ease off a little bit on some of these transactions. And the combination of that will be that we've got EPS pressure in the back half of the year. And our focus is okay, what is the reasonable result to deliver to shareholders in a year in which we expect modest revenue decline of the overall firm. And you can look, we expect modest improvement overall in RIS and pressuring consultants. I think you can kind of cottoned on to the idea that RIS will have better margin outlook, than what the consulting division will have and we're not going to artificially do things in consulting to drive margin when the top-line is under that kind of pressure.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then, my second question is specific to Marsh. I know, you guys have pointed out last quarter that there would be a lag on that the third quarter would be worse than the second quarter. It sounds like from your comments if that still holds, I guess. My question is more thinking further out than that, if there isn't a spike in cases and no COVID kind of is maintained what think it will be today? Do you think within your business, the Q4 should represent a bounce from the third quarter? And this is just specifically to Marsh.
Dan Glaser: Okay. So I'll hand off to John in a second. Obviously, we are thrilled with the positioning of Marsh. And when we look at the future for Marsh, we couldn't be in a better position in terms of our risk and advisory businesses, our placement capabilities and our water capabilities. And I couldn't be happier with the combination with JLT. And just as a reminder, that's all about growth, growth and talent, growth in capability, growth in scale, revenues, earnings and within one year, we came together as one single formidable team, textbook integration that happens throughout the company and really kudos to my leadership team for pulling it off. We made people and structural decisions very quickly, we worked through this structure and in fact, we are ahead of schedule on total amount and timing when it comes to cost savings. Overall, well planned, well led, well executed. John, you want to talk a little bit about how you see Marsh back half of the year and as you look out to 2021, 2022 and 2023, in terms of this year to your flavor?
John Doyle: Sure, Dan. As we talked about the second half, it's likely to be a bit more challenging given the economic consequences of the pandemic. I don't want to get into the third quarter versus the fourth quarter. I mean, obviously, things are quite fluid with pandemic and it's hard to predict the economic consequences. We've talked about many times, uncertain environment, we've operated in, having said that, as Dan pointed out, I think we're extraordinarily well positioned. Our team is highly focused on our clients and getting the best outcome. It is very, very difficult environment. They've been there for one another, obviously, I'm a stress [indiscernible]. And so, I couldn't be more pleased with how that comes together. And there are some silver linings, of course, while overall a human tragedy, what we've all been living through the cultural integration has gone on exceedingly well. So I'm confident in our ability to perform, well on a relative basis and when things improve, we'll continue to see improved performance in the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: One quick accounting question to start. Mark pointed out in the press releases as $36 million revenue adjustment for exposure units. Does that all fall to the bottom line? Are there offsetting reductions to expenses?
Dan Glaser: Mark.
Mark McGivney: It all falls to the bottom-line, Meyer. I mean, it could be in our overall earnings and bonus formulas a little bit of impact to the extent, earnings grow or shrink for a year, but that specific adjustment, it is directed to revenue and bottom-line.
Meyer Shields: Okay. So, I think that is a good news. Broader question, and I think this is for Dan. Back, I don't know last time we had had like, rate increases that were this powerful. Marsh was obviously very heavily fee focused, but the general takeaway was that it was able to negotiate higher fees because of the incremental work that more or less matched the revenue increases that would have come on a commission basis. And I'm wondering, given the recessionary conditions. How does that play out in the current environment?
Dan Glaser: Well, I mean Marsh over a long period of time has become a much larger middle market firm, particularly in the U.S. and the U.K. And with that, there gets to be a little bit more element of commission versus fee. And I think the last time we spoke to you was, think around about two-thirds on a commission basis and a third on a fee basis. It's not easy out there and buy, whether it was negotiating with a client or negotiating with an insurance company. And so there's negotiations that take place account by account as the level of work and what the proper level of remuneration is for the intermediary. And so it's not a direct line that revenue or premium is up and so therefore, immediately, we pop on the same basis there. This is all about account by account discussion and negotiation and trying to determine the value that we provide in the market, one as an advisor to clients but also sometimes as a distributor for insurance companies.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.
Paul Newsome: Just one question. Getting some questions from investors about just the enormous amount of change we're having with your competitors and merging with Marsh and [it can't be] [ph] Aon and Willis. And it seems like there's a private equity firm every day popping up as a competitor. What's happening with the hunt for talent, is it gotten easier or harder given all the changes, we've seen in the market?
Dan Glaser: Yes. No, it's a really good point because actually we're in the talent business that's what it is, it's a piece of business. Do we have a smarter, more creative, harder working more dedicated to client service colleagues than what our competitors do? And I'll start by saying very broadly that competition is good. Competition refreshes, competition puts you out on your front foot and keeps you very active and innovative. And clearly there's some PE that's in the market largely on the middle market part of the business. You And you scared me a little bit with your comment about the get together Aon and Marsh, and I thought you were breaking news there for a second. But I'm not going to comment in depth on anything to do with Aon and Willis. We do think that that will have lots of opportunities. I mean, I like our strategic positioning. I wouldn't trade places with any of our competitors. And on a personal comment, as somebody who's had almost 40 years in this business, I don't think the Aon Willis combination is good for clients or good for the market. But I do think it's good for Marsh & McLennan. I mean, come on, the big three becomes the big two, how could that not be a benefit to us?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.
Michael Phillips: I just one for me as well. Dan, just love to hear your thoughts on how the pandemic is influenced valuations in the M&A space for brokers.
Dan Glaser: First of all, the M&A space for brokers, where you have seen most of the activity is in the upper middle market and below. And as Paul was just alluding to, there's a lot of PE in that space and then the Mac may be a little bit different for them because the leverage levels are a bit higher. And the ability to borrow money at low interest rates, or at least probably even more [indiscernible] than it was a year or two ago. And so that's going to remain an active market. I don't think you're going to see much change in multiples right now, multiples are high, probably too high, in our opinion in some areas, but the multiples are high. So it really is, well structured the deal. With all the uncertainty out there, you probably look at more of an earn out component than what you would otherwise see a year or two ago. And you also have to be really focused on but what's the EBITDA most of the businesses which are for sale so to speak are private companies and so it all gets [indiscernible]. And I think actually the EBITDA calculation on a pro forma basis is more important to be reviewed and scrutinized and to get comfortable with the multiple itself. You want to know what will that business do in your hands and so, we're still active. We don't generally compete with PE in that space because we're generally having a more limited discussions with companies in the brokerage space, particularly in the U.S. with Marsh & McLennan agency, but we're committed to that part of the market. We think it's a great business and we will continue to be a buyer.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America.
Josh Shanker: Maybe Mark could give us a little detail on numbers. But can we talk a little about T&E? And you said you're going to be starting to do T&E again, at least in some, can put the numbers behind this. How much was suppressed in the second quarter? And how much do you --
Dan Glaser: Yes, Josh. We never give absolute numbers on T&E because once you do it forever. I mean, T&E, it's not an immaterial number. But obviously, you're not talking double digits of spending and travelling and entertainment, but you have to think there's two things one, in the second quarter, you got to think T&E was off big time. Like me talking about mid 90s type of percentage points, nobody was travelling or entertaining. So that's a huge downdraft. And I may have misspoke in terms of when I talked about T&E, I don't expect T&E to bounce back in any way in the second half of the year. So, there won't be much put it this way travel or entertainment for the balance of the year, what I was trying to get across was over time, even looking into 2021 and 2022. I'm not sure T&E ever at the same level it was pre-COVID. I don't know if people will really travel as much because I don't think it's necessary as what the perception was before. So I do think over the long-term T&E may be one of those areas where we have an expense benefit and that is lasting where we will -- where T&E will obviously go up from near zero, but it won't go back to the level that it had been pre-COVID.
Josh Shanker: So with that in mind, when I try and think about expenses in the back half of the year, I expect them still to be materially down from the second half of '19. But I know you're not giving guidance but modest EPS increase for the full year sort of implies a material down turn EPS in the back half of the year, with expenses down, I mean, I know you're not going for explicit guidance, but it seems like [indiscernible] expenses still persisting the back half of the year. I'm not sure why we should expect a year-over-year decline in earnings, even if revenues fall off a bit.
Dan Glaser: Well, I mean, at the end, we're a revenue based company. You looked at our second quarter where our margins were RIS margins were up 430 basis points, with modest levels of revenue increase that obviously is not sustainable, which means we basically shut down large swathes of the expenses of this organization, because of the great uncertainty as to what was going to happen on the top-line. We now have more clarity around what's going to happen on the top-line. And we do believe the top-line across the firm will feel a bit more pressure than the second quarter. It doesn't mean, we're going to fall off a cliff. But it does mean that some of the benefits we have in the second quarter at the momentum than we had from the fourth and the first, a base and then we're just faced with the now of revenue pressure and we want to release a little bit of some of the expense pullback drawback that we have. And as I was saying before, Josh, this is an art rather than a science. We could cut our expenses significantly from here and deliver margin improvement in the back half of the year, even if our top-line is negative, but it would not be good for the company in any type of midterm or long-term perspective. So we're not going to do that. We're going to continue to invest in this organization, the dislocation that exists in the market, the ability to strategically recruit, the movements of digitization, our technology, modernization, all of that work continues, and we're going to continue.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies for any closing remarks.
Dan Glaser: Thank you, operator. And thank you to all of you joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our 76,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication as well as their support of each other, clients and local communities. I am impressed and humbled by their response during these challenging times. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. Thank you all very much and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.

Dan Glaser: Thank very much and good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I’m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also, with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations.I am pleased to report that our first quarter results were excellent, despite seeing early signs of COVID-19 related headwind. Before I get into our results, I want to start by addressing the current crisis. We are living through deeply troubling times that are unprecedented in our life time. This is first and foremost a human tragedy with the health and livelihood of virtually everyone around the world is threatened, and the ultimate economic impact is still very much unknown.We do know that the next several months and possibly longer will be difficult. Uncertainty is at an all time high. There is poor visibility, business outlook has been severely damaged and confidence is down. Even though it is hard to imagine at present, we will see the other side of this crisis. In the aftermath, there will be a prolonged adjustment. I don't think any of us expected quick return to life as we knew it.However, recent data shows that, our response to the crisis is helping to flatten the curve. And we can already see some parts of the world take early steps towards recovery. And then see businesses are working at multiple levels to get global economy working again. Underpinning our work is our interaction with government and clients including banks, insurance companies and all sectors of the global economic infrastructure.Navigating the current period is challenging for all enterprises. Yet Marsh & McLennan has proven to be resilient, strong and unique. We will learn and improve as an organization during this difficult period. Marsh & McLennan has never been flatter, faster or more connected than we are today. And I expect some of how we are adapting through this period will benefit us over the longer term.I want to share some insight about how we are operating in the crisis. The safety and well-being of our colleagues is our first priority. We move quickly to suspend travel, implement work from home and put in place flexible work policies. We have a world class executive team, which I'm incredibly proud to lead. We also like to thank our colleagues who have rallied in their support of each other, and our clients.Over the last decade, we've invested significantly in the infrastructure of our business across the world. We are a globally integrated firm in terms of systems and processes. And this is proven invaluable in our response to this crisis. Within days, we were able to pivot close to 100% work from home with over 70,000 concurrent remote connections across the world and virtually no disruptions in our business and our ability to serve clients.In fact, we have a number of recent new business wins where nobody met in person. We entered this crisis in a position of strength and are focused on delivering reasonable financial performance in the short-term, while supporting our colleagues and positioning the firm to the mid to long-term. We've made several decisions reflecting this approach.In mid-March, we committed that while we are in the thick of this crisis, our colleagues jobs are secure. We also set up a $5 million support fund for colleagues in need, as well as committed to matching charitable gift contributions.Our decision for colleagues interest is first is guided by our values and aspirations as a company. This doesn't mean we are being complacent on cost reductions during this period. It is simply the right thing to do. It also speaks to our confidence in the strength of our business, which will rebound as the global economy improved.We've moved back to cut non-essential expenses and reduce capital expenditures, and we will obviously see meaningful decreases in G&A. We're taking prudent and necessary actions to manage expenses, but at the same time, we're still focused on positioning for the long-term. As an example, in early April, we closed another terrific acquisition in MMA Assurance Holdings, which will operate at the Midwest regional headquarters for MMA. So far in 2020, we announced three MMA acquisitions, and in just 10 years MMA has grown into a leading mid-sized business platform in the U.S. approaching $2 billion in revenue with 7,200 colleagues in 150 offices.I am inspired by the hard work, dedication and focus of our colleagues in this unprecedented time. It is their efforts to demonstrate the strength and character of Marsh & McLennan. The environment will remain challenging and the duration is unknown. But, Marsh & McLennan enters this period in a position of strength and we will emerge on our front foot.This month marks the one year anniversary of our combination with JLT. I am pleased to say the major elements of integration including integration of colleagues, culture and financial system are behind us. We are well along the way on technology.Our strong first quarter results are evidence that the initial period of choppiness from the acquisition is over. And we emerge as a stronger more diverse company, with more capabilities and geographic depth. We are a unified firm globally, we are working as one enterprise, smarter, more connected and more creative than we were a year ago.During these challenging times, we continue to innovate for positive change for our clients, focusing on shaping the industries in which we operate. In health and benefits, Mercer Marsh Benefits created a COVID-19 product, which is now supporting over 500,000 employees in Italy.The team then developed similar products to support people in more than 30 countries, with all regions working together, exchanging findings and truly operating as one team around the world. Our benefits technology Darwin has also proven very valuable to clients helping them rapidly inventory their pandemic coverage, address gaps and deploy creative solutions to their employees, such as access to virtual physical and mental well-being services and telemedicine.We’ve also been advocating for the development of public private partnerships around the world who address pandemic risk. Marsh and Guy Carpenter are bringing policyholders, insurers and the government together to develop public private partnerships to accelerate economic recovery and restore a more resilient global economy in the future. Mercer is helping clients to assess updated pension costs and funding level projections and investment portfolio options. We've been advocating the short-term pension funding release to help businesses address near-term cash challenges and protect jobs.In Oliver Wyman, we are helping clients with their crisis response, navigating the impact on demand and supply as well as working through financial and liquidity challenges. We've developed a proprietary tool called the pandemic navigator that helps companies predict future COVID-19 development, informed by different suppression tactics and ultimately estimate overall and company specific economic impact. The tool covers more than 40 countries and all U.S. States will help our clients plan for when and how to conduct business after the crisis has subsided.Many of our clients around the world are already actively using the tool and accessing our experts, including more than 100 healthcare organizations, several government and public sector entities over a dozen major financial services companies and corporations across sectors. In summary, I am proud of how our company is responding to this crisis.Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance market conditions. P&C insurance pricing continues to increase. The Marsh global insurance market index increased 14% versus 11% in the fourth quarter, and 8% in the third quarter. Global property insurance was up 15% in global financial and professional lines were up 26%, while global casualty rates were up 5% on average. Keep in mind however, our index used a large account business where we typically earned fees. Small and middle market insurance pricing increased more modestly in the mid single-digit range.Given the losses from the pandemic, pricing trends globally are likely to continue. The range of insured loss outcomes from the pandemic is wide and evolving. The loss is unique, because it is ongoing. It will take a long time for us to be fully understood. It affects nearly every country and it also led to a simultaneous asset stock. What we do know, is there will be significant losses in lines such as event cancellation, travel, D&O, workers compensation, credit lines and political risk.The potential for other losses, business interruption or otherwise make the overall loss difficult to estimate at this time. The determination of coverage for the virus will be policy-by-policy. But, we think legislating retroactive coverage is a step too far and will challenge the very notion of insurance.Declining exposure unit due to the economic fallout from COVID-19 will put downward pressure on premiums, although it will vary greatly by industry and by line of business. In some cases, carriers are offering or considering proactive premium adjustment. Although to-date it is limited in commercial lines. In some market regulators are looking for mandate refund.Turning to reinsurance, the April 1 renewals are largely focused on Japan. Following a couple of years that were the worst the Japanese tycoon activity experienced in recent times. Japanese insurers paid significant increases to a renewal of their capacity excess of loss covers. The rates and other loss-free lines were stable.The upcoming June 1 renewals are largely focused on Southeast U.S. wind exposure. Many renewal placements are expected to face upward rate pressure from continued loss created from 2017 and 2018 hurricane events. In addition, reinsurers will be assessing the impact from COVID-19 related issues.Overall, the global P&C insurance market is complex. Pandemic issues continue to evolve and this is before we enter the U.S. hurricane season. It is in times like these where our expertise and capabilities are even more critical.Now let me turn to our first quarter financial performance. We delivered excellent results in the quarter with underlying revenue growth of both Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting. Total Revenue was $4.7 billion up 14% or 5% on an underlying basis. Underlying growth was strong in both segments with RIS up 5% and Consulting up 3%.Adjusted operating income increased 15% versus a year ago to $1.2 billion. The adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points to 27%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8% versus a year ago to $1.64 reflecting strong underlying growth and margin expansion.Even though COVID-19 will impact our results for the remainder of the year, our strong first quarter performance is evident that we enter this period in a position of strength and able to manage through this difficult environment.Moving to -- on to an update of our expectations for 2020. The current situation is still evolving and it is uncertain how deep and prolonged the downturn will be. Our outlook is based on a short global economic pullback starting in the second quarter, with the global lockdown lifting in the third quarter, but recessionary conditions persisting through the year.For the full year 2020, we currently expect a modest decline in underlying revenue. We are being vigilant and disciplined regarding discretionary expenses. We've strong control over our cost base and have leverage that our disposal to manage in the near-term. For the full year, if underlying revenue declines moderately, we could be adjusted EPS in a similar range or slightly better.With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, Dan, and good morning. Our first quarter results were excellent. And although the current crisis will impact our performance this year, we faced it well positions and strong. Dan covered the high level results for the quarter. So, I will provide some additional details on our results, and then turn to updated views on our outlook in capital management.Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, first quarter revenue was $2.9 billion, up 20% compared to a year ago or 5% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 20% to $932 million and our adjusted operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 34.5%.At March, revenue in the quarter was $2.1 billion with underlying growth of 5%. Growth in the quarter was broad-based and driven by the strong new business and renewal. The U.S. and Canada division delivered another quarter of strong growth with underlying revenue of 5%. The U.S. and Canada have achieved 5% or higher underlying growth in seven of the last eight quarters.In international underlying growth was solid at 4%. EMEA with 4%, representing the highest underlying growth in that region in 12 quarters, led by strength in Continental Europe and in Middle East. Asia Pacific was up 6% on top of 8% in the first quarter of 2019. This result is impressive considering the virus impacted Asia in the first quarter and Latin America grew 3% on an underlying basis.Guy Carpenter's revenue was $827 million up 25% or 7% on an underlying basis driven by strong growth in EMEA, North America and Asia Pacific. Guy Carpenter has now achieved 5% or higher underlying growth in nine of the last 10 quarters.In the Consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was $1.8 billion up 5% compared with a year ago or 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income was $289 million and the adjusted operating margin contracted by 80 basis points to 17.2%.As we mentioned on our last call, we expected the first quarter margin to decline in Consulting due to some quarterly volatility, and the inclusion of JLT’s Employee Benefits business, whose margins have historically been relatively low in the first quarter.At Mercer revenue in the quarter was $1.3 billion with strong underlying growth of 5% continuing the trend of sequential improvement in growth from the first quarter of 2019. Wealth increased 3% on an underlying basis, reflecting low single-digit growth in defined benefits and mid single-digit growth in investment management.Our assets under delegated management were approximately $267 billion at the end of the first quarter up 1% year-over-year, but down 12% sequentially due to the decline in equity market.Health grew 8% on an underlying basis the strongest growth since the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting solid performance across the portfolio and Career grew 2% on an underlying basis.At Oliver Wyman, revenue in the quarter was $511 million, which was flat on an underlying basis. After a good start to the year we saw the beginning of virus related impacted Oliver Wyman in March.Adjusted corporate expense was $54 million in the quarter. Our other net benefit credit was $64 million in the quarter. And for 2020, we anticipate this item will be modestly lower than in 2019. Based on current expectations, we would assume roughly $256 million for this -- or the 2020 versus $271 million in 2019.Foreign exchange with a slight headwind to EPS in the quarter assuming exchange rates remain at current levels. We expect FX to be approximately $0.86 per share headwind for the remainder of the year.Our effective adjustment tax rate in the first quarter was 23.2% compared to 22.6% in the first quarter last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discrete items, the largest of which was the accounting per share based compensation similar to a year ago.Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%, based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2020.April 1, marked the one year anniversary of our acquisition of JLT. And we are on plan or ahead of schedule on all of our key milestones, including cost savings and restructuring actions. We incurred $80 million of JLT integration and restructuring costs in the first quarter, bringing the total to-date to $415 million. We remain on track to achieve our guidance of at least $350 million of JLT savings by the end of 2021. We still expect to incur $625 million of cash costs and $75 million of non-cash costs to achieve these savings. While it remains our expectation that a significant amount of our actions will be taken in 2020, the current crisis could impact timing as we navigate through the near-term. As a result, we could see some shift in our expectations for integration costs and savings between 2020 and 2021, but our current view is the impact will be relatively modest.Our outlook for 2020 has obviously changed in light of the current crisis. We want to share how we think our performance could develop, but have to emphasize that we have less visibility into how our results could unfold over the next few quarters than at any time we can remember.Our view is based on our outlook today. And it goes without saying that conditions to turnout materially different than our assumptions, which would affect our projections. As Dan mentioned, our outlook is based on a sharp economic pullback starting in the second quarter, with the global lockdown lifting in the third quarter that recessionary conditions persistent through the year.Based on these forecasts and our internal analysis, our current view is that we could see a modest decline in the underlying revenue for the full year with the deepest declines in the second and third quarters.At Marsh, we still see the potential for modest underlying revenue growth for the year, although the second and third quarters will be challenging. We believe Guy Carpenter will see mid single-digit underlying growth for the year, with a stronger first half and a weaker second half. We currently expect Mercer could see underlying revenue declined for the remainder of the year and be down modestly for the full year.Oliver Wyman will see a meaningful pullback in underlying revenue in the second and third quarters that could be greater than the peak decline we saw in the financial crisis. We would note, however, that once the financial crisis is sided and the global economy is stabilized, both Mercer and Oliver Wyman experienced a strong rebound in underlying growth.Contemplating this outlook on the top line, we moved quickly to manage our expenses and significantly cut back on every discretionary expense across the firm. Our earnings will benefit from these actions as well as to continue contribution from JLT synergies. Based on this, if our revenues in the range that we've discussed, we could see adjusted EPS for the year in the same range or slightly better.Turning to capital management and liquidity, in addition to our existing $1.8 billion credit facility of which $800 million was unused at the end of the quarter. We recently secured additional borrowing capacity in the form of a new $1 billion line of credit. This was a proven step to increase our access to short-term funding given the uncertainty of the current environment.On our fourth quarter call, we provided an outlook for capital management and that outlook is clearly changed in light of the current environment. While we intend to maintain our dividend, it is unlikely we will grow the dividend double-digit this year. On the fourth quarter call, we indicated that we did not expect any share repurchases in the first half of 2020. At this point, we do not expect to repurchase shares this year.We remain focused on deleveraging, although the pace of debt pay down will ultimately depend on our cash flow generation in the current environment. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $13.6 billion, compared with $12 billion at the end of 2019. This increase in debt is primarily due to short-term borrowings to fund seasonal cash needs, which are highest in the first quarter. We were also holding additional cash in quarter end to fund the purchase of Assurance Holdings and M&A acquisition that closed on April 1.Our next scheduled debt maturities are in December 2020 with $700 million senior notes will mature and in January 2021 when a $500 million term loan comes due. During the first quarter, we repaid $500 million of debt that matured.Interest expense in the first quarter was $127 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $140 million of interest expense in the second quarter. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $1.5 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $476 million and including $232 million for dividends and $244 million for acquisitions. Overall, we are pleased with our excellent first quarter results. We are a resilient company. We enter this crisis from a position of strength.And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.
Dan Glaser: Thank you, Mark. And operator we're happy to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. And interest of addressing questions from as many participants as possible. We would ask the participants limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. [Operator Instructions] We will now take the first question from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Mike Zaremski: Hey, good morning, and thank you for the prepared remarks and the update on the guidance. My first question is regarding your outlook and other I guess, if revenues potentially declined by single-digits and earnings could very well then potentially also fall by single-digit, I think that's a pretty good outlook relative to past recessions or maybe I'm wrong, maybe you can kind of talk to -- are the dynamics different from for Marsh & McLennan this time around versus the past recession are there – are you -- the business less technical or are there more kind of levers in terms of cost reduction efforts that you can pull this time around versus recession a decade or plus ago? Thanks.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Mike. Never thought I'd miss you guys. So, it's good to have some people on the telephone. I'm getting tired of looking at the same my team every morning. So, but, every crisis is different, Mike, it all has its own unique attributes and while there are parallels to draw, you can't get really focused on, it was like this last time, so it'll be like this time. I think the important thing is, MMC is really defensive and resilient, we're not immune to this kind of crises. But for us, the impact on manifests itself we produced the management consultants series services and lower premium growth due to the explosive decline.And the explosive decline may be more significant than they were in the global financial crisis. But on the other hand, at that point in time rates were generally going down and now rates are generally going up. If the recovery is faster than we outlined in our scripted remarks, then we'll do better than our guidance. And if the downturn is deeper and more prolonged will do worse.But the impact on us, we believe is manageable. And when I think about resilience, ever think about things like, clients are going to continue to buy insurance. They're going to continue to renew their health and benefits program. They're going to do their annual actuarial work. And so, that kind of thing a level of recurring revenue, recurring engagements that we have, will continue.We mentioned that Oliver Wyman is expected to see the most significant negative revenue impact. But keep in mind, the cost structure, I have mentioned many times before the cost structure in Oliver Wyman is more variable than in the rest of the company.And so, it helps us to mitigate the earnings impact because of the cost variable cost nature of OW. Now, if you mentioned, the financial crisis and just go back in time, RIS in 2008 was 0 they were flat, and in 2009 was a minus 1. And the Consulting division actually grew in 2008 and was down 7% in 2009. And OW, back in the last crisis contracted for six quarters consecutively, and then had a pretty strong rebound after that. And clearly when we looked at OW now, it's a completely different firm and certainly has been our best blower over that elongated period. But Mike, you have a follow up?
Mike Zaremski: Yes, that's helpful. My follow up is, Dan, you talked about the extreme uncertainty regarding COVID-19 related losses, and I guess revenue impacts for the entire industry. I’m curious, what are you guys seeing and your teammates seeing in April regarding commercial P&C pricing, is it actually moving higher despite the economic pressures to begin the uncertainty? And maybe if there's any distinctions between M&A kind of small, medium sized agencies versus the largest clients that that'd be great too? Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Sure and I'll hand off to John and also to Peter to give me deeper commentary. But I'll just start by saying, we're an intermediary. We're insurance brokers and on the Marsh side of the house, we do everything we can to negotiate broad coverage terms and high quality, best site available sort of thing. And that's what we'll continue to do. That's our job until to us. We're not trying to strike a balance between insurance companies and our clients. We're an advocate for our clients. And these are tough times for a lot of our clients. And so, we're working hard to obtain the best terms as possible, because nobody wants to be paying premium increases at a time when cash is king.And so, we're really focused on doing our best. And we expect in this kind of environment, there's a bit of a flight to quality. There's also higher levels of client with retention anticipated and probably softer new business as we go forward as we work through. But John you want to talk about the overall environment for COVID losses and how you're seeing the market today? We're going to be plugging john in a second. But what Peter Hearn let me go to you and talk a little bit about the reinsurance side.
Peter Hearn: Yes, Dan. The reinsurance market pricing was already increasing prior to COVID-19. It continues to increase. And so, we're looking at this as a continuation of a market that was already in transition principally in the United States more than in Europe. But, I would imagine the advent of COVID-19 that there'll be a reevaluation of risk throughout reinsurers’ entire portfolio.So, April 1, we saw increases in Japanese risk, principally based on several years of Typhoon loss. In Florida, no doubt there will be a reevaluation of risk based on the loss free from events in 2017 and 2018, which Dan mentioned in his opening comments. But I would say in general, the reinsurance market has acted responsibly in their pricing to our clients based on exposure, based on loss experience and based on their overall relationship with them.
John Doyle: Okay, thanks, Peter. One other things that that we mentioned in our script is that we're entering the U.S. hurricane season. And so, this market is special. And the one thing that all companies want, but in particular insurance company see to some level of certainty with regard to, what loss has happened and how it's going to impact them. And because in a lot of ways, premium levels, at least on the rating side are determined by past losses is probably the primary determinant of what's going to happen to rates in the future is what happened to losses in the past. And COVID is really unique because it is a low developing catastrophe. So, we all know, it's going to be big. But, it's in real time right now. I mean, the losses are ongoing, and it's global. And so, on that standpoint, clearly we're going to be battling with insurers on rate levels, because in many areas, they're going to be seeking higher rate levels.
Dan Glaser: Okay, so next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So first, I just had a question on your exposure to a potentially sort of the debate that's going on, on business interruption. How do you sort of think about your exposure to claim of their client might think that they're covered for something and then the they're not I know, you had like $0.5 billion in dollar settlement in the last -- about 10 years ago, but can you give us any details on your own liability coverage redemption or the mix?
Dan Glaser: Well thanks Jimmy. Yes, I mean, the Alaska situation is completely different from this one. And so, really it doesn't apply. But, our role and principle focus as a broker is to advocate forcibly for policyholders, and doing our best to obtain broad coverage and in the event of a claim assisting them with recovery and so from that standpoint, that's what we do. We're on the client side of the table trying to develop outcomes. And as we mentioned in the script, this is going to be, a case-by-case sort of a basis This is a different wording out there. Some language is much clearer than others.And so therefore, there will be different impacts as we go through advocating for clients. In terms of our own risk management practices over the last few years, we've streamlined our professional standards, we've conducted E&O training with thousands of colleagues, and we've instituted widespread limits of liability. So E&O is a large risk exposure to us. We are in the business of giving advice, but on that – but I think we are entering this crisis with consistency and controlsin terms of how we render that advice.
Jimmy Bhullar: Okay, thanks. And then -- yes, on -- this is a different topic, and you discuss this in your comments as well. But as you did, and obviously did the virus is an evolving situation, but based on your views right now, Q3 is probably going to be weak, third quarter should be weak as well. Do you expect your drop and your results to be in the third quarter or is it more likely in 2Q and you think you're going to slowly be emerging out of it in the third quarter?
Dan Glaser: No, I think that the impact, generally in insurance, you have delayed impact geared up with renewal dates and that sort of thing. It's not immediate type of impact. I think we're going to feel headwind in parts of our business significant headwinds, both in the second and in the third quarter and I can't really say which one is likely to be more significant, when I look at the overall company and as we decide before, RIS to do reasonably okay, in this circumstances here. Mercer, we're thinking, it's going to be negative, most likely for the balance of the year. But overall, we think it's probably a modest decline for the year and there'll be proper pullbacks in OW. And in fact, at the end, we're very much focused not only in managing this crisis to the best we can, but also emerging from this crisis stronger than we otherwise would be. And so, we're not fighting every end for the second and third quarter. We're fighting for the next three years, and we're making sure that we're doing the right things now to ensure that we're positioned well.
Jimmy Bhullar: That's clear. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Beth Greenspan: Hi, good morning. My first question on going back to the outlook as well. So, you guys pointed to, modest decline in underlying revenue outlook and said that, EPS could decline by a similar amount. So, that would imply, that your margins would be fairly stable, it'll hold up pretty well for the year. I just want to confirm that I'm thinking about that right. And then Dan going back to some of your other comments. you guys imply a sharper declines within Consulting, so is it right to think that you would see more of a margin impact within Consulting and maybe RIS margins could hold up on better during the downturn?
Dan Glaser: Yes, you you're spot on Elyse, and I would just in general, we're not really focused on margin, we're focused more on issues around revenue and earnings. And margin will be an outcome of what happens on the top line to a large extent. But you're right on and thinking that based upon what we’ve said about RIS, it's likely that RIS's margin hold up and may even improve a bit. And on the other hand, it's likely the Consulting margin based upon what we said is going to occur with their revenue outlook, are going to reduce. And overall companywide, I can't make a call right now in terms of that. I do know I love streak. And we've had 12 years in a row of margin expansion, and so we won't give that one or two easily.
Elyse Beth Greenspan: Okay, thanks. And then my second question on, you pointed to business in the second and the third quarter and it sounds like just in response to previous questions that, that there is a bit of a lag on the brokerage side. So, sounds like maybe third quarter weaker than the second quarter on Consulting on some of the weakness that you called out within Oliver Wyman and within Mercer, is that more immediate in nature? And so should we think about Consulting, kind of flowing on over in the next couple of quarters kind of, in my initial results might be to the same degree?
Dan Glaser: Yes, I think the way to look at it is, what's recurring revenue and what's more project related and that has more of an impact as to whether something falls in Consulting or something falls on the RSI side. On the RSI side there's a significant amount of recurring revenue, but parts of Mercer have a lot of recurring revenue as well. And so both of those recurring revenue pieces probably have a longer time horizon or a lag effect and so you will see an impact over the second and the third quarter as those businesses adjust. Areas which has non-recurring revenue, it could be done project related Consulting in Career within Mercer it could be most of Oliver Wyman is project related. Those will be faster decline, more immediate decline. And so you would be right in the second quarter in those parts of the business coming off. Next question please, operator.
Operator: The next question comes from Greg Peters from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Charles Gregory Peters: Good morning. My first question is on we've seen a number of companies in the insurance industry announced no layoff pledges. One of your peers has announced salary cuts. And there seems to be a level of social responsibility that is becoming increasingly more important. So, I'm curious about how you think that might impact things around cost saving initiatives and synergies, both currently and the future M&A.
Dan Glaser: So thanks, Greg. I mean, it's a really important question. And it's multifaceted. But, let me talk about it a little bit from our perspective. I mean, I -- we did talk about both Marsh and I that our visibility into our outlook is uncertain, so making decisions with so much uncertainty about outlook isn't easy. But those decisions are best done with clear eyes and the collective judgment of a seasoned team. So, we've spent a lot of time surveying the horizon. And in our view, as I was just mentioning, we're in a resilient business. Yes, it hold up pretty well. Some parts of Consulting are going to see meaningful pullback, but we expect them to come back strong as the economy recovers and so we've got many different levers on the expense side at our disposal.We want to preserve flexibility and optionality for as long as we can. And we want to make decisions based on data scenario planning, stress testing, and we've got all kinds of capability within the firm in order to do that, and we recognize that there are different levers for different challenges. When we think about expense cuts, and our bonus pool it's primarily giving us levers to protect earnings, and by the way just as an aside, our bonus pool in 2019 was the largest in our history, so from that standpoint, bonus pools expense cuts are going to protect earnings as we go forward.To us salary reductions and things like dividend cuts are levers to protect liquidity it's kind of like survival mode stuff. And we would -- we took some other actions, we secured additional assets and liquidity early in the crisis. We believe that that's going to help us manage through most scenarios to the slowdown in collections impact our cash flow.And as we saw in the financial crisis, there was a slowdown in the collection cycle, but it is temporary, so solving that issue by reducing pays is an awfully blunt instrument, and it can have lasting implications, starting with the notion of battering trust with your colleague base by challenging them when they're in this difficult period and the snap back that all recurring cost, once pay is lifted back again it's just a couple of things that make it really problematic.Also you can't just implement that kind of thing easily this Consultation rules in most countries and so doing some sort of broad base pay reduction programs are very difficult. And the impact oftentimes will fall most heavily and unfairly on the U.S. population and so based upon our outlook today, levers like pay cuts or dividend cuts are not necessary. We track daily cash activity so we can get early warning signs and we can react quickly if those levers are warranted, but I can't emphasize enough that we are managing this period very closely. We have never been more connected as an organization, the leadership team and I meet every day and we are watching new business, expenses, exposure, pricing, cash flows obsessively as a leadership team and we are calm and we are clear-eyed in this crisis. Our intention is that in terms of levers to avoid being late and pulling a lever, but also avoid doing something now that is harmful, and later proved to be unnecessary.
Charles Gregory Peters: I want to pivot to the balance sheet. First its two parts that I'm just curious in the light all these get back and delay programs and premiums, if you could address the net receivable balance on your balance sheet and if you have any concerns on that. And then in the debt component, I know, you spoke in your opening comments about how you took down the $2 billion of revolver and then you paid off $500 million, but the long term debt piece increased from $10.741 billion at the end of the year to $11.231 billion and I don't understand why the long-term debt would have increased when you paid down $500 million. Thank you for your time.
Dan Glaser: Sure, let me hand over to Mark who will walk you through not only our approach on accounts receivables, but what we're looking like on the debt side. So, Mark?
Mark McGivney: Sure, there's a lot in that question. So, I'll try to hit all those points. First, just to hit a little bit on liquidity in the collection side how we feel we're positioned, Dan hit on a little bit of this, and then you go into a period like this. And you pull back and focus on the basis and liquidity and flexibility are definitely on that list. And so very early in the crisis, we jumped on this from both a financial perspective and an operational perspective.So, I mentioned earlier, in addition to our $1.8 billion credit facility, we went out almost immediately, and secured an extra $1 billion short-term line of credit, just as additional firepower going into this period of uncertainty. And remember, we had $1.5 billion in cash on our balance sheet some of that was to pay for the insurance acquisition, but we've typically run about [$1.1] billion on average at any given point in time.And so we've got substantial liquidity available to us as we enter this period. In terms of collections and visibility, we've operationalized around this like, as I said, this heightened visibility on the potential for a slowdown in collections. And in financial crisis, there was one. And so it's something we could anticipate. And Dan mentioned earlier, we've invested a lot in globally consistent systems and platforms and the finance area is one of those. So, having accounting platform and financial reporting platform uses very good visibility into accounts receivable balances, aging, trends, and all of our businesses are taking advantage of that.And the other thing we're doing is we have pretty good visibility in our major countries and just daily catch deposit and cash flow activity. And so this is something that you can anticipate and prepare for and whether it's financially in terms of flexibility or operationally to try to mitigate any impact is, as best we can. We feel well prepared. Just a couple of things on what you said, we still have $800 million of capacity in our existing short-term credit facility, not even the [$1.1] billion.So, not all of what you see in short-term debt there is revolver borrowing. And that's, we typically -- the increase we saw on short-term debt in the first quarter is what we typically see every first quarter, first quarter is when we pay out our bonus payments and we fund that through short-term financing. As I also mentioned, we were holding on to a little bit of extra cash for the Assurance acquisition.And then just the increase in long-term debt that was just a move we made early in the year just to turn out a little bit of the short-term financing. We had and it’s a lot of flexibility we're building into and we built into our term structure just relating to the debt we raised as part of financing JLT. So, overall we have pretty substantial access to short-term liquidity and we feel like we're pretty well mobilized around, any risk associated with delay in the collection cycle.
Dan Glaser: Thank Mark. Next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. My first question is around the environment. I mean, typically, when we would see two large competitors merging, I would have thought that could have created some opportunities for the folks that are not distracted by a large deal. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that or is that something we shouldn't expect, given all the uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic?
Dan Glaser: Well, I'm not going to comment on the potential merger between AON and Willis, I'll leave it to them to comment on it. We like our strategic positioning, we would not change position with any of our competitors. We believe that, we are set up very well, we're in the right countries, we've got the highest quality colleague base, we've got a client which would be the envy of any company in the world.And so we think that, we'll be able to grow substantially in the future based upon the fact that we're the leading provider of services around risk strategy and people and we like the way we're set up. I do know, we've learned an awful lot about integrating activities over the course of the last decade, we've done a number of acquisitions and, of course, JLT was the largest acquisition in our history. And we had a terrific year, a remarkable year in 2019, even though we were doing a lot of integration work and that is down to the quality of the executive team and the matching of culture that existed.They -- were the cultures were not identical, that's to be sure. But they're both high quality. They're both positive. They're both client focused. And so on that basis I really think that our fourth quarter demonstrate tick that box. JLT was a special acquisition for Marsh & McLennan and was the successful integration. We had 5% underlying revenue growth for the firm, but more specifically the places that really overlap the most with JLT is that Marsh at 5%, Guy Carpenter at 7%. And Mercer was 5%, but it was 8% underlying and health and so the quality of what we've been able to deliver, I mean, our adjusted operating income and almost $1.2 billion is a first quarter record for us.And so we're thrilled. We were set up for a wonderful year in 2020 in -- okay, so now, like the rest of the world we're dealing with the crisis, but it doesn't take away from the fact that we are a stronger, more capable, more creative, more connected firm than we've ever been before.
Suneet Kamath: Got it. It makes sense. And then the quick one for Mark, I think you had mentioned both the debt maturity in early 2021, as well as some term debt. So, just the thoughts on retiring those debt securities?
Mark McGivney: Yes, sure. The short answer is, we would expect to, pay those off through operating cash flows, notwithstanding the crisis and okay, that the -- that's changed our outlook. The second and third and fourth quarters for us is generally where we generate pretty substantial cash flows and we still anticipate that, at this point, based on what we see, we're going to have good cash generating through operations for the balance of the year.
Dan Glaser: Next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from Phil Stefano from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Phil Stefano: Yes, thanks. Dan, you talked about the expense levers that you have at your disposal to dial them back and trying to do so in a, prudent fashion, just given the outlook for where you think your things are going. I mean, it's not too far, but make sure they're far enough to have a positive impact. I guess when we think about these expense levers where is the expensive leverage you can pull more quickly than others. And have you thought about the extent to which maybe some expense levers don't come back, because if they're so easy to dial down this quickly, do we really need them as we think about business moving forward?
Dan Glaser: Yes, I mean, it's a great question because I think there are certain things that that are occurring which may actually last longer and maybe be permanent as we go forward. I mean things like flexible work arrangements may put our pressure on our real estate costs over time not in the short-term, but over time as an organization we have proven to ourselves and to our clients base that we can work from home, we can work remotely and do it effectively.And so there's an awful I mean, I absolutely believe that more agile environment, more digital are going to be a part of our future and that would be a real positive.Now in terms of expensive levers there’s several that you can pull. I mean, I start from the idea that we have a very significant bonus pool as I mentioned before in the last 2019 our bonus pool was the largest level in the aggregate in our history as a company.And it's all here, net operating income, so we are team deep within the organization, is very aligned with shareholders and very aligned with the net operating income of the firm. And so it will be geared if the NOI is dropping while the bonus pool is not listed, and that's a wonderful lever, because it's variable, it's variable for a reason. And the other thing I would say is, we're a people business and while you may have less attrition in a recessionary environment, you still have attrition, and we thought in other recessions and we do not have a hiring freeze, in fact, we're hiring people every day, but we will control our hiring and we'll make sure that our executive team is very involved in making the decision that we want to make, but we'll manage our attrition that way and have some more control over that.Clearly, significant pullback in the use of temps for contractors and things like T&E have fallen away a lot of marketing spent. The things like conferences, meetings, events over time, all things that that we have as levers which have largely already been pulled to some extent and you can always go deeper there. But, we're comfortable in what in how we're set up. I mean, at the end, we said that we think that that our overall revenue might be down modestly as a company for the year. And if so then our overall EPS will be down modestly as well. But it might be slightly better than what our revenue would go.
Phil Stefano: And that's the reason I follow-up and it's a quick one, but when you talk about the EPS being down modestly, if not slightly, but the correct base for that is [indiscernible] of 2019 adjusted EPS. Is that correct?
Mark McGivney: That's correct.
Phil Stefano: Okay, thank you, Dan.
Dan Glaser: Thanks.
Operator: I'd now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies for any closing remarks.
Dan Glaser: Yes, hi. Thank you operator and I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to applaud the tireless dedication of our 76,000 colleagues worldwide and the important role they played supporting their colleagues, clients and local communities. Times like these tested true character of an organization and the strength of individuals. And what I've seen from MMC in the past few months has been nothing short of amazing. So thank you all and have a good day.
Operator: That will conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-30 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan’s Companies Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. Fourth quarter 2019 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company’s website at www.mmc.com.Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements.For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our Earnings Release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC website.During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of those measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today’s earnings release.I will now turn the conference over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Please go ahead.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Holly. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I’m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also, with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations.2019 was a remarkable year for Marsh & McLennan. We completed the acquisition of JLT. The largest deal in our history, while delivering strong financial results and managing the global integration. MMC is well positioned. Our talent capabilities, expertise and leadership have never been stronger. In addition of world class talented JLT compliments our best in class teams at Marsh & McLennan, and while we still have work to do, we feel good about how the cultures are coming together.Nearly all our teams are now sitting together and more and more we are in the market working as one. We finished the year with revenue of $16.7 billion, up 11%. This represents our highest annual topline growth in 20 years and it is a step change for us. On a run rate basis, we now have over $17 billion of annual revenue. We had an excellent year and I’m pleased that in the midst of the integration we generated underlying growth of 4%.The tenth year in a row where our underlying growth was in the 3% to 5% range. 14% adjusted NOI growth. 110 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 7% adjusted EPS growth consistent with our guidance of modest dilution in the first year of the deal. We met our capital management objectives to reduce our share count and increase our dividend by double digits. And we are running ahead of schedule on acquisition related cost savings. We now expect run rate savings of at least 350 million and we will continue to drive for additional operating efficiencies.Overall, I am pleased with our performance in 2019. We consistently challenge ourselves to balance delivering for today, while positioning for sustained growth in the future even in an exceptional year like 2019. We continue to invest in Marsh & McLennan Agency, our fast-growing U.S. middle market brokers business completing five acquisitions in 2019, resulting in current run rate revenue of 1.7 billion and we have a robust pipeline for 2020.We made additional investments in digital, technology and analytics. We see further opportunity to leverage technology, to expand in small commercial, as well as streamline and automate our business. We also see increasing opportunity to leverage the collective strength, expertise in relationships across our business to deliver enhanced value to clients and drive growth.Lastly, 2019 saw the seamless transition of leadership at Mercer with Martine taking over as CEO. Martine was critical to install new leaderships in key areas, energized the workforce and implement changes that streamline the operating model, create more efficiency and enables better execution. As we conclude 2019, we emerge a stronger firm than we started out the year with record revenue record adjusted operating income and record adjusted earnings per share.As we look into the future, there is significant uncertainty in the world given current global issues by geopolitical risk, negative interest rates, trade friction, extreme weather and climate change, pandemic risk, and cyber risk. We come to the four in these dynamic times by providing trusted support to our clients in the areas of risk, strategy, and people.Marsh & McLennan provided thought leadership on key global issues at the World Economic Forum in Davos. This was the 15th consecutive year we produced the annual global risk report together with the World Economic Forum. The report ranked some top global risk and this year climate and weather-related risk created the greatest concern. Climate change was the most prominent issues discussed at Davos, and there is glowing recognition of the urgency at both mitigation and adaptation.We are engaged with our client across all of our businesses on helping them assess the impact of a change in climate. Mercer and Oliver Wyman had session on general quality, longevity, responsible investment, and AI readiness. Despite all the uncertainty in the world, I am optimistic. Business leader continued to push for growth and investment despite near term risk and fears about the longer-term implications of climate change.The perspectives and insights we provide on these topics are a reminder of the uniqueness of MMC and the value we bring to our clients. Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance pricing trends. Pricing is firming across a wide range of geographies and lines. The Marsh Global Insurance Market index saw an increase of nearly 11% in the fourth quarter, compared with 8% in the third quarter, 6% in the second, and 3% in the first.Global property insurance and financial and professional lines saw the highest average renewal rate increases at 13% and 18% respectively. Casualty rates are up 3% on average, up slightly versus the third quarter. Commercial auto and excess cash we continue to see rates rising while workers comp continues to see rates decline. Note that the Marsh index skews to larger risks, which are seeing higher increases, although middle-market and small commercial insurance rates are up in certain geographies.Turning to reinsurance, the Guy Carpenter global property catastrophe radar line index rose by 5% at the January 1 renewals. All those dedicated reinsurance capital increased by approximately 2% at year-end. Although renewal outcomes vary widely across individual programs, capacity is tightened in some stress classes like commercial auto, D&O, medical professional, and general liability.The retrocessional market continues to see meaningful increases in rate at January 1, driven in part by track capital, a lack of new alternative capital entrants and continued redemption from third party investors. The overall global P&C insurance market is challenging and we continue to work hard to deliver the best solutions for our clients. In times like these where our expertise and capabilities shine.Turning to the fourth quarter, we are pleased with our results. Our overall revenue growth in the quarter was 15%. Underlying revenue grew 3% with growth in both segments. Marsh grew 3% in the quarter on an underlying basis, which is solid, but slower than the prior quarter as expected due to a peak headwind on new business and a tough comparison for the fourth quarter of 2018.Guy Carpenter finished the year strong with 10% underlying revenue growth in the quarter. Mercer delivered 4% underlying revenue growth in the quarter with strongest growth since the first quarter of 2018, and Oliver Wyman declined by 2% as we expected. The overall fourth quarter saw strong adjusted operating margin expansion of 100 basis points and adjusted operating income growth of 17%.As we consistently say, it is important not to over emphasize a single quarter and rather look at performance over longer periods of time. Looking at the full-year, we are pleased with our results. We generated strong overall revenue growth of 11% for the full-year with 4% underlying growth. We demonstrated topline strength across our businesses, while achieving the initial benefits of the integration.On an underlying basis, Marsh delivered solid growth of 4% for the second consecutive year. Guy Carpenter had a strong year with 5% growth. Mercer had 2% growth and Oliver Wyman grew 6% for the year, despite the pull back in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted NOI grew 14% with overall margin expansion of 110 basis points for the year, marking the 12th consecutive year we have reported margin expansion. Adjusted EPS grew 7% or 8% on a constant currency basis consistent with our guidance of modest adjusted EPS dilution in the first year of the JLT acquisition.In sum, 2019 was an example of strong overall execution on multiple levels. As we look at 2020 and beyond, our future is bright. The addition of JLT enhances our competitive position. We are increasingly bringing our collective strength to clients and we expect to see benefits from our investments in digital and technology. In 2020, we expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range. Margin expansion and strong adjusted EPS growth.With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark McGivney: Thank Dan. Good morning. We are pleased that our fourth quarter results, which capped a strong year in 2019. Consolidated revenue increased 15% in the quarter to $4.3 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 3% and the continued contribution from JLT. Operating income was $592 million, while adjusted operating income rose 17% to $856 million. Our adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 21.9%. GAAP EPS rose to $0.76 and adjusted EPS increased 90% to $1.19.Looking at risk and insurance services, fourth quarter revenue grew 24% to 2.4 billion and was up 3% on an underlying basis. Good result considering the tough comparison Marsh faced to its strong fourth quarter in 2018 and the fact that Q4 was JLT’s seasonally largest quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 31% to $550 million, and the adjusted margin expanded 200 basis points to 25.7%.For the year, revenue was $9.6 billion, an increase of 17% and solid underlying growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income for the year was up an impressive 17% and our adjusted operating margin in RIS increased 60 basis points to 26.3%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter rose 23% to $2.2 billion increasing 3% on an underlying basis. The U.S. Canada division underlined growth of 4% for the quarter and 5% for the full-year. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of 4% or higher underlying growth for U.S. Canada.In the quarter, the international division had underlying growth of 1% with Asia Pacific up 7%, Latin America up 2%, and EMEA down 1%. For the full-year, revenue at Marsh was $8 billion, an increase of 17% or 4% on an underlying basis. Guy Carpenter’s revenue was 152 million, an increase of 10% on an underlying basis for the quarter, representing an outstanding finish to a strong year. The growth in the quarter benefited from strong results in North America, as well as growth in retrocessional and an active quarter for GC Security. For the year revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of 15% or 5% on an underlying basis.In the Consulting segment, fourth quarter revenue increased 4% to 1.9 billion with underlying growth of 2%. Consulting adjusted operating income was flat year-over-year at 359 million and the adjusted operating margin of 19.7% declined 60 basis points versus a year ago, but looking to full-year margin expansion is solid. For the year, revenue was 7.1 billion, an increase of 5% with underlying growth of 3%.Adjusted operating income for the year was up 9% to 1.3 billion and our adjusted operating margin increased 90 basis points to 18.6%. Mercer’s revenue increased 8% in the quarter to 1.3 billion with underlying growth of 4%. Wealth increased 2% on an underlying basis with investment management up high single digits and define benefits download single digits.Our overall access under management continue to grow. At year-end, exceeded 305 billion, up 5% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Health revenue grew 6% on an underlying basis in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong growth in both international and in the U.S., Career grew 4% on an underlying basis with strong growth in serving products and digital implementation.For the year, revenue at Mercer was $5 billion, an increase of 6% or 2% on an underlying basis. Oliver Wyman’s revenue in the fourth quarter was $559 million, a decline of 2% on anunderlying basis. As we said on our last call, we expected a full backing in the fourth quarter. For the full year, Oliver Wyman produced strong underlying revenue growth of 6%. We made great progress in 2019 on the JLT integration and are on plan or ahead of schedule on key milestones.We continue to expect the transaction when we modestly diluted to adjusted EPS in the first quarter, mutual in year two, and accretive in year three. We are ahead of schedule on cost savings and restructuring actions. We now estimate run rate savings of at least 350 million. We expect to incur approximately $625 million of cash cost to generate those statements.In addition, there will be approximately 75 million of non-cash charges, mostly property-related cost as we consolidate our real estate foot print. We achieved approximately 125 million of savings from year-end 2019 and expect to achieve the balance by the end of 2021. We also encouraged 335 million of JLT integration and restructuring cost in 2019 to achieve these savings.It is our expectation that the bulk of the remaining costs will be incurred in 2020 with a more modest amount extending into 2021. This update reflects the plans we have today, and as we continue to get deeper into the integration there is a possibility for more savings opportunities to emerge. As we look to the first quarter of 2020, keep in mind that the last quarter were our year-over-year comparison is impacted by JLT. Remembering RIS the first quarter is seasonally small for JLT.In addition, JLT’s employee benefits margins are relatively low in the first quarter and we expect this along with some quarterly volatility will result in decline in first quarter Consulting margin. However, for the full year, as Dan mentioned, we expect strong earnings growth consolidated adjusted operating margin expansion.Turning back to the fourth quarter, adjusted corporate expense was 53 million in the quarter. Fourth quarter, we recorded 264 million of noteworthy items. The majority of which are related to the JLT acquisition. Included in this total are 143 million of JLT integration cost, largest categories which is severance, 17 million of JLT acquisition-related costs, 56 million of other restricting costs, and 42 million of earnout true-ups relating to prior acquisition.As we typically do on our fourth quarter call, we will give a brief update on our global retirement plan. Cash contributions to our global defined benefit plans were 122 million in 2019, up slightly from the 112 million in 2018. We expect cash contribution in 2020 will be roughly 160 million. For 2020, we anticipate our other net benefit credit to be slightly lower than in 2019. Based on current expectations we would assume roughly 264 million for this item in 2020.Investment income was 2 million in the fourth quarter for both GAAP and adjusted results. For the full-year 2019, our GAAP investment income was 22 million and adjusted investment income was approximately 12 million. For 2020, we expect only modest investment income on an adjusted basis. Foreign exchange was a slight headwind for adjusted EPS in the quarter and is up $0.05 per share negative impact for the full year 2029.[Assuming] exchange rates remain at current levels; we expect FX to be at slight headwind from adjusted EPS for 2020. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter was 23.4%, compared with 23.6% in the fourth quarter last year. For the full-year 2019, our adjusted tax rate was 24.1%. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted tax rate for the full-year was approximately 26%.When we give forward guidance and have our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2020. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of our stock for 185 million. For the full year 2019, we repurchased 4.8 million shares for 485 million.Total debt at the end of 2019 was 12 billion, compared to 12.6 billion at the end of the third quarter. Net debt maturities in March 2020, 500 million of senior notes will mature. During the fourth quarter, we incurred 130 million or interest expense, we expect approximately the same amount in the first quarter of 2020.As we look to 2020, the frame work for capital management we discussed in the early stages of JLT is still on track. This year, we currently expect to deploy approximately 2.6 billion to 2.9 billion of capital across three broad categories. Debt reduction, dividends in line with our objective of double digit increases annually, and a combination of acquisitions in share repurchases.Directionally, we currently expect the amount of capital deployed to be roughly equivalent across these three categories. This plan allows us to maintain our dividend growth objective and meet the commitments for deleveraging we laid out when we announced JLT. We also provide flexibility for M&A. We’ve consistently stated that we favor attractive acquisitions over share repurchases as we view high quality acquisitions as the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long-term.Our track record is good, as evident by our return on invested capital of nearly 20% over the last three years. Given our deleveraging plan and our acquisition pipeline, we currently do not expect any share repurchases in the first half of 2020. Ultimately, share repurchases later in the year would depend on how the M&A pipeline developed. Our deleveraging should be largely complete by the end of this year and we expect to have substantial flexibility in terms of capital deployment in 2021 and beyond.Our cash position at the end of the four quarter was $1.2 billion. Uses of cash in the fourth quarter totaled $444 million and included $24 million for acquisitions, $235 million for dividends and $185 million for share repurchases. For the full year 2019, uses of cash totaled $7.5 billion, and included $6.1 billion for acquisitions, $890 million for dividends and $485 million for share repurchases.In summary, we are proud of what we’ve accomplished in 2019. We’re very much on track with the objectives we set when we announced the JLT acquisition. And if you look forward to 2020, our outlook is for another year of strong performance.With that, I’m happy to turn it back to Dan.
Dan Glaser: Thanks Mark. Operator we are ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question today from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. So, my first question, you guys updated the savings program for JLT toady. It also seems like intangibles are coming in a good amount lower than when you guys had announced this deal. So, I’m just trying to, I guess get from that that you have these two tailwinds to your numbers and you still are, you know, reaffirming I guess that the deal will be breakeven in 2020 and accretive in 2021. So, what's the offset relative to your initial expectations that this deal, might not be accretive sooner than you had expected?
Dan Glaser: Thanks. Well, you know, actually it’s going to be at least accretive consistent with our original expectations. And so, a deal of this size has always a number of puts and takes. And as you mentioned, we think the cost savings are higher, we think the amortization in lower, and then we also needed to divest some businesses, principally aerospace, but also some minority interest in other businesses like CRP here in the U.S., which we did not anticipate, you know, going into the transaction. And we also have some revenue headwinds that we had described before whether that was from new business pipeline issues or some staff inspections. Those are things that we're grappling with.So, you put it all together and the deal is tracking in line with our original expectations, and our original expectations, I’ll just remind everybody, were really good. That was going to be a good solid financial transaction. It was also very strategic in nature for Marsh & McLennan as a company. And when we talk about things like accretion and dilution, you know, it’s always a level of how we’re growing, you know, so it’s – we expect 2020 to be a strong year in adjusted EPS growth, you know, and that’s what breakeven means to us.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, that’s helpful. And then my second question, on last quarter’s call, you guys had alluded to the overall margin for the company expanding more than the year-to-date level. It seems like the fourth quarter came in a little bit below your expectations. Was that just may be, you know, a little bit weaker consulting margin? Just trying to understand what happened in the fourth quarter as we kind of think about the level of margin improvement going forward.
Dan Glaser: We focused very much on earnings growth and topline growth much more than we do on margin and we certainly don't really pay much attention to any one single quarter. We were satisfied for the year with the 110 bips and the fourth quarter was pretty consistent for the year. There’s always a lot going in all of our businesses, and so, you know, it’s not that we look at one versus the other as in any way coming up short of what our expectations were.I mean when I look at margins in general for the company, 2019 is going to be our 12th consecutive year of margin expansion and nearly significant levels of margin expansion. When you go back a decade and we’re up by 1300 bips, you go back five years, we’re up, you know, 450 bips plus in both segments and as a company, and so, you know, but just to go back, I wouldn’t look at any one quarter as being indicative, you need to look at longer periods of time.And margin expansion for us is an outcome of how we run the business, which is revenue growth almost always exceed expense growth and that will give us margin expansion over time. And the only areas that we were really driving for some margin this year was in RIS in parts of the portfolio, particularly, in Guy Carpenter that we felt we needed to adjust JLT to more similar margin levels in what we had normally been operating within as Marsh & McLennan. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Mike Zaremski: Good morning. First question regarding the Risk and Insurance segment, looking at the EMEA segment, you know, growth there has been, let’s call it, a very, very low-single digits for the past couple years. Is that a pace that we should kind of – you know any color, is [that a patient], maybe, we should expect thinking about it into this year? and then, I guess also LatAm growth also just of a little bit weaker in the second half of the year, anything going on there and just sort of thinking out till 2020?
Dan Glaser: Yes, I’ll take you to a little bit and then I'll hand over to John. You know overall, believe we’re set up well in both EMEA and Latin America for the future growth not even in – not only in 2020, but beyond. Honestly, EMEA includes UK, which has been our biggest area of overlap with JLT where we knew it was going to be a bit choppy for a while. And so, that’s essentially when we look at the business, we unpack the different component parts of EMEA. But, John, do you want to add more to that?
John Doyle: Sure, Dan, thanks. Big picture, 23% GAAP growth in the quarter, you know, very, very big growth. 17% for the full year, 4% underlying growth for the full year, so I was pleased with the results. As Dan noted, and as we expected, in the UK the underlying growth was impacted by integration related headwinds and some first quarter challenges remain, but, you know, I will say, I’m encouraged by improvements in the underlying performance in the UK.We made some leadership changes now about 18 months ago in the UK, and they're really setting the foundation for stronger growth going forward. And in Latin America, as I noted in the last call, as Dan, integration related challenges will persist through the first quarter, but Latin America remains a high growth region for us. So, for the second quarter on, I expect improved results there. And again, I want to say, I’m pleased overall with the growth. I’m quite proud of the team.We managed through a lot of change throughout all of 2019 and we maintained our focus on serving our clients in what's an increasingly challenging market as well. And you know as Dan noted, we’re a stronger team entering 2020 and JLT is obviously a big part of that, but, you know, we also had more in late 2018 and did a lot of work on integration of more than last year. And we added two Top 100 firms in the United States through the M&A as well. So, I’m quite excited about the team and how we’re positioned as we enter 2020.
Dan Glaser: You have another one, Mike.
Mike Zaremski: That’s helpful, that’s helpful. Yes. Lastly sticking on the brokerage space, you know, Dan, in your prepared remarks you – I think you said it was a challenging marketplace. I assume you’re referring to what’s, you know, maybe ‘a hard market’ and you can correct me if I’m wrong. Just curious does the – does this challenging market also put a little bit pressure on Marsh’s expense space given, you know, your employees are working, you know, potentially even harder to represent their clients in this marketplace?
Dan Glaser: But we are built to operate well across cycles. And, you know, I mean, the – I wouldn't necessarily classify the entire market as a hard market, its certainly hard in pockets and its certainly true as you noted that Marsh and Guy Carpenter brokers have to run a lot harder to get things done and had to work, you know really hard and creatively in order to serve clients in challenging market conditions. And so, we recognize that.We don’t believe that that puts any over pressure on our expense levels, you know, more than the fact that we recognized that our people are working harder than ever before and we appreciate that and we reward them for it, you know, but our teams, you know, are driven by serving client, and so, that’s what their focus is. You know, so they're out there hustling, not in the belief that somehow their compensation or anything else is going to change. It’s actually that they’re focused on delivering for their clients.Next question please.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Ryan Tunis: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Dan, I guess I was hoping maybe you might be able to quantify perhaps the total drags that you think right now the organic revenue growth rate is failing because of, I want to say, disruption, but because of the JLT integration process. And is that – you know was that worse this quarter than in the third quarter? Is it still getting worse? Or, you know, is the magnitude of that lessening going forward?
Dan Glaser: Well, let me talk about that broadly because I think it’s a good question. First of all, I’d start with the basis, when I look at our underlying growth, I’m pleased with 3% in the quarter, and I'm nearly pleased with 4% for the year, relative to the quarter and Carpenter had a terrific quarter and a strong year, top and bottom line. Oliver Wyman, as expected, they had a tough quarter with 6% for the year. Mercer, 4%, solid for the fourth quarter and sequentially improving throughout the year. And again Marsh, I'm pleased with the 3% given, as we told you, there were some tough comps both from Marsh’s performance last year in the fourth quarter, but also JLT’s performance in the fourth quarter. And then, the new business hurdle, which was a very big new business quarter for JLT last year.We had talked to about the pipeline issues throughout the year. And so, you know, in the context of the largest acquisition in our history, I’m quite happy with the underlying growth levels. Although I – I just like to take another minute to talk about growth a little bit more because I understand the way you're looking at, it’s not the way I look at it. You know from my perspective; we have had a tremendous growth year on multiple levels and we have significantly outgrown our competitors. We've outgrown our competitors and capabilities. In talent, our headcount is up 10,000 people from this time last year. We’ve outgrown our competitors in revenue and the number of clients and it all starts with GAAP.You know there is certain time where GAAP is more important than underlying and I think this year was one of those times and our total revenue is up 11% in 2019 and 15% in the fourth quarter. If you look at RIS, RIS grew 24% in the fourth quarter. We've been at it for [148 years], and to grow 24% in the quarter and a firm like ours is something, and as John was alluding to before, we grew specifically in Marsh. Latin America was up 15% in the year, Asia-Pacific 39%, EMEA 16% all in 2019 to allow our base and our trajectory will be better for years and years to come as a result of the remarkable year we had in 2019 on a growth basis. Do you have something else, Ryan?
Ryan Tunis: Yes. just – I guess just on U.S. Canada organic, a little bit of deceleration there. And I'm just curious for your perspective into 2020. I’m thinking about the market conditions like those have seem to be a tailwind. You know, how are you thinking about how all that comes together?
Dan Glaser: Yes. I mean U.S. Canada performance has been terrific the last couple of years, but, John, do you want to talk about that a little more?
John Doyle: Yes, I’m quite pleased with our team, Ryan, in the U.S. and Canada because we had a terrific year this year. I would also remind you that we had 7% organic growth last year in, you know, the underlying growth in the fourth quarter. Both MMA and Marsh had terrific years. We also had a very good finish to the year in Canada and quite a strong year there as well. Our MGA operations in the U.S. are performing quite well as well. Our private client business did quite well from a growth perspective. And on the specialty front, we had good growth in our credit specialty in the private business, aviation did well and the transaction risk in cyber, are a couple of products that are going nicely as well.
Dan Glaser: Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Mike Phillips: Yes, thank you. Good morning everybody. I was just curious, Dan, on your thoughts on how much, I guess at a very high level, how much do think there’s more room to go on the legs of the PNC overall price environment? I mean is that going to peak? Do you say I guess maybe a peak time for maybe the end of this year? Or how much more room do you think there is to grow on the overall environment for pricing?
Dan Glaser: That’s a $64 question. I mean at the end you’ve got different things that work, I think you’ve got many insurance companies who are just satisfied with the results they have achieved financially over the last several years. And so, there was a factor impact in many companies at the same time then they’ve got a little blood in the eye and they're looking to get back to a better position. You also have the, you know thoughts around social inflation and how real that is and how it's impacting their prior book as it will slower.You have pressures on the reinsurance side, then I’ll go to John and Peter in a minute to give a little bit more, but, you know, there’s pressure on the reinsurance side, which may build throughout the year. This will put some pressure on primary carriers. And so, you know, ultimately, it’s a matter of what’s the loss activity and the premium levels will over time reflect, you know, it’s a benign environment or whether it's a harsh one.I mean certainly when I think about this year, I look at the level of catastrophe potential, and you know, if it’s a tough cat year, earlier, we’re into a quite a ride. If it’s a benign year, in the Southeast, particularly, well, maybe some of the window is out of the cell, but I don’t think a lot has to do with how casualty develops, but why don’t we start with the primary in John and then we’ll go to reinsurance just to talk more broadly about market conditions and maybe if we have any prognosis, but John?
John Doyle: For me, it is an earnings driven market change for sure. Dan talked about some of the trends continuing into the first quarter, but there continues to be a very wide range of outcomes in markets built around the world. I don’t consider it a hard market although it certainly becomes more challenging for our clients. You know, and geography base is Australia, U.S., UK wholesale are seeing the largest increases. In the U.S., it’s about 10% and going for the high teens average rate increase in Australia. In Asia, Continental Europe, Middle East, Latin America, UK retail more mid-single digit price increases.You look at it from product perspective, Dan, their property is up 13% globally. Financial line is up 17%, meaningful increases there. Causality up 3% where we see a real mix, you know, where comp continues to be down. Excess liability, though, particularly in certain classes of business are quite stressed at the moment. And public P&L, particularly in the United States and Australia, are a couple classes that are the most challenging. You know, I would note, Dan is going to talk about this again, but our index skews the large accounts.The middle market is flat to low single-digit in many markets, most markets throughout the world, but, you know, we're continuing to hear from underwriters. They're concerned about rising loss cost, as Dan noted social inflation or the impact of litigation funding on the claim environment. You know, we’re also observing and working with our clients through some challenging verdicts in large settlements in pharma and chemicals and commercial auto and in P&L. So, you know, there’s no question. There’s some stress, you know, in the loss environment and its difficult to predict where – you know, where markets will head, but the there are some storms on the underwriting.
Dan Glaser: Peter?
Peter Hearn: Thank you. I think from a reinsurance standpoint, the market is responding – very responsible, and it's really been a function at 1-1. The pricing and the renewals were largely shaped by, you know, a couple of factors, deterioration loss experience, a lack of new alternative capital and increasing challenges in the environment with regard to primary insurance and retrocessional markets. You know, there’s a wide spend of pricing, some was flat to down in certain geographies, in others it was down significantly.In the retrocessional market, we saw increases of between 15% and 20%, but I don't believe the market – the reinsurance business is hard. I think it’s more expensive, but it certainly isn’t a hard market, which we define as at any price, you can't generate traction.
Mike Phillips: Thanks.
Dan Glaser: Mike, do you have follow-up?
Mike Phillips: No. thank you all for your thoughts. I appreciate the color.
Dan Glaser: Okay. Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW. Please go ahead.
Meyer Shields: Great, thanks. Dan you've been very upfront about the fact that when you worked on the merger, you anticipated some level of producer and client outflow and I’m wondering if you look forward to 2020 is there any margin pressure because in 2019, overly simplistically, you had revenues associated with people that had left the firm?
Dan Glaser: Yes, it’s a good question, but, you know, our anticipation – I mean as I mentioned it before, there’s always a lot puts and takes in a transaction of this size and geographic breadth, and as we look to 2020, we expect to expand margins as Marsh & McLennan. You know, and so, we think that it will be our 13th consecutive year of margin expansion and we think we’re on the strong year in adjusted EPS. You know, I would say, look, when we went into the transaction, you know, big people business combination, we expected some level of defections. And so, when I – when we sit here today and we look to where we are, even though there are some people who left the firm who we would have preferred not leave the firm, we’re in good shape.You know, where we’ve had the most significant levels of levers would be, you know, let’s say in London, in the UK market in London, well, we are strong in London. We were strong and we are stronger today and more people by a very, very wide majority stayed rather than left. And so, we're in great shape from that perspective. And so, I mentioned 10,000 additional headcount, you know, and these are smart, hard-working talented people, which will deliver a lot of value for us into the future, and our ability in a place like London to regenerate ourselves using our existing capability, the JLT addition, and then going into the market to the place and people who have left, our ability of regenerating half of the [talents in] London is amongst the highest places in the world. And so, they – you know, it’s not something that’s anything more than short-term.
John Doyle: And I would also note that the voluntary turnover rate at legacy Marsh was the best it's been. Since we collected data. So, from that perspective, you know, it’s quite stable year from talent perspective.
Dan Glaser: Meyer, do you have a follow-up?
Meyer Shields: Yes, just a quick one. So, in the break down by segment, there was an 8%, I guess hit to Guy Carpenter’s revenues from a divesture. Is that going to persist for the next few quarters?
Dan Glaser: Mark, why don’t you take that?
Mark McGivney: Meyer, on that schedule, you'll see that column heading, it's acquisitions and positions and others. So, from time-to-time, we’ll have to do changes in mapping the businesses or other things that we use that column to adjust for expenditure, the year-over-year comparison are, you know, apples-to-apples. There was no divestiture in Guy Carpenter. It really was just comparability adjustments and the fact that Guy Carpenter is revenue base was so small in the quarter, it just magnified that. There should be no ongoing impact from them.
Dan Glaser: Next question please.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So, just a question first on Oliver Wyman and the weakness there, I think, organic growth slowed the last couple of quarters, how much of that is just normal volatility in the business versus maybe shifts in spending on the part of your clients?
Dan Glaser: Yes. So, a couple of things. I've mentioned in the past that Oliver Wyman has more volatility on the topline than our other business because they have less recurring revenue, but the – they actually had a strong year through nine months and they had anticipated some slowdown in the fourth quarter, but Scott do you want to give more detail?
Scott McDonald: Sure. We definitely had a weak Q4, but there was really nothing significant that happened and the result was driven by three things. The first was the project movement from quarter-to-quarter, which regularly happens with us and drive some volatility. We could see that coming in Q4 and we signaled a little bit of a pull back on our last call. The second thing was we did have a solid Q4 last year where we grew 7% and the third thing was, we did see a modest, but what feels very much like a temporary slowdown in a couple of markets in Q4.So broadly, the business was strong across sectors, but both Europe and Asia showed some weakness, primarily in the financial services business, but it feels like it was temporary, and that the Q4 results they haven’t changed on medium term expectations. We continue to plan for mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth over time. And for the time being, as said, we demand for consulting purposes feels solid across sectors and across regions.
Jimmy Bhullar: Thanks, and [indiscernible] on Guy Carpenter and the second – each of the past couple of quarters, you’ve had double digit growth and those are obviously the lowest quarters of the year in terms of the base. How much of this is driven just by this base versus maybe better momentum in the business that could potentially carry into this year?
Dan Glaser: Thanks. Peter, do you want to…
Peter Hearn: Jim, it is really a combination of both. They are smaller quarters for us, but they are also being driven by good new growth. We’ve had our third year of record new business wins in the United States in our retrocession business and our Asia-Pacific business. Our facultative business, which we very rarely talk about, has grown significantly. All of those can impact a small quarter as you’ve seen in Q’s 3 and 4, but it’s more a function of phasing than it is anything else and a very disciplined approach to sales and growth.
Dan Glaser: We were very pleased with the progress and growth for the year. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Yaron Kinar: Hi, good morning. My first question is on the cost initiatives from the integration programs, do you have any sense how much of that 350 million or greater will actually fall to the bottom line versus reinvested back in the platform?
Dan Glaser: I mean, general sense is that the majority of it will fall right through the bottom line and that is how we projected when we originally put things together. Obviously, earnings will go well. So, some of them will go into bonus pools and that sort of thing, but a lot of the efficiency gains that we have developed is because of the investments that Marsh & McLennan made over a number of years. You know, when you think about things like financial systems where Oracle 12, everywhere in the world. HR systems, we’re Workday everywhere in the world.We use sales force extensively throughout the world and so we are able to take an organization by JLT and integrate our systems and controls and functions reasonably seamlessly without adding to a lot of our existing cost base in order to do that, and that gives us a lot of benefit and really I should not impact the frontline client facing people all that much. So – and that’s one of the reasons why most of it will drop.
Yaron Kinar: Okay, understood. And then going back to some of the questions around growth, from this 3% to 5% organic growth target there could be talked about in the past. Just looking one of your peers have been kind of talking about – kind of mid-single digit or better or with long-term and I’m just trying to square the 3 to 5 to that other guidance, are there structural differences between the two organizations or is it just more conservative guidance on your part? Are there just near-term headwinds just with the integration now that maybe once you got through those you do that to a higher – a step-up in that organic growth number?
Dan Glaser: I mean, I’m one of those people who are like, you are with your results, say you are from the last 10 years we’ve been in the 3% to 5% organic growth range. I do not believe that we had many competitors. We’re a pretty unique company across the breadth of the things we do. Clearly, we have certainly formidable competitors and parts of our business, but across all of the things that we do including Oliver Wyman and some of the strong businesses we have within Mercer.We don’t have many direct competitors, but when I look at the competitive landscape, I absolutely believe I wouldn’t change our strategic positioning with anybody, I wouldn’t exchange our capabilities with anybody or our culture and there is no reason under the sun to where our revenue growth performance would not be as good or better than any of our competitors over time. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Larry Greenberg of Janney. Please go ahead.
Larry Greenberg: Thank you. Not much left to ask, but I guess this is for Mark. Just wondering if maybe the trajectory of expense saves has accelerated a bit from earlier from when you initially gave your guidance on that? I mean, it looked like you, you know what you saved in 2019 as a percentage of what you now think of the total is a little bit higher than how you initially walked into this period and so I am just wondering if that is correct?
Mark McGivney: I guess Larry just that a little bit further on savings, as I said, we expect to take most of the actions to generate the full 350 by the end of this year, just what I said with the charges, maybe a little bit is going to 2021. Then the remainder of the savings have come in over the two years. Probably more in 2020 than 2021, but as I said earlier, we expect to realize the full impact of the savings by the end of 2021.
Larry Greenberg: Thanks. That’s it.
Mark McGivney: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Styblo of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Styblo: Hi there. Thanks for the questions. Just want to ask a little bit about capital deployment after 2020, I think you guys are pretty much done with your debt paydown plans, curious how that effects your thinking for M&A after this year? Does that open up on that, possibly doing something a little bit larger or are you guys inclined just to keep things on a more modest basis as you continue to integrate JLT?
Dan Glaser: We have acquisitions that are a core part of our long-term strategy. We’ve done something like 175 plus acquisitions since January 1, 2009 and we tend to be a balance company. When we look about – we put out our dividend first. It's sacrosanct. We want to grow it double digit every year and that is going to be for the sake of argument looking at the number of circle $1 billion for that, which should leave in most years 2021 and beyond, roughly a couple of billion dollars to deploy between acquisitions and share repurchase.And as we’ve said in the past, we favor acquisition over share repurchase for the very reason we’re building a great company and our focus as we have showed over time we’ve been able to do that, you look at Marsh & McLennan Agency in 2009 with zero revenue and no position and now we’ve got a terrific platform, $1.7 billion growing well, good EBITDA margin etcetera. We’re in a business that we otherwise would not have been. That was called building a company and we are committed to continuing to do that with all kinds of opportunities across the enterprise not just in Marsh, but across the firm in order to acquire our way to be a better strong more formidable company in the future.And so, when you look at that 2 billion and our debt to EBITDA at that level will probably be in the [low 2’s] and so we would have the ability to flex as we needed to. So, there is certainly nothing that we’re finding for in terms of a larger or mega acquisition we will see how this strategy develops over time. It’s certainly having, you know $3 billion to deploy year after year after year is going to make us you know one of the great companies of the world.
David Styblo: Alright, got it. And just a quick house-keeping, I think I heard for the first quarter given the business mix and so forth, the consulting margins were expected to be down year-over-year, I don’t know if I heard a comment about RIS?
Dan Glaser: Yes. We did make a comment specifically about RIS. We wanted to point out consulting because of our visibility to it and we recognize that consulting has its own attributes. You know RIS is a different kind of business and so as you know the consulting margins declined in the fourth quarter, even though we had a 90 bips improvement for consulting for the year and so we just wanted to give a heads-up that our expectation is for a decline in the first quarter for a variety of different reasons which our view is temporary and when we look at the full-year 2020, we expect it to be our 13th year of consolidated margin expansion for the entire firm.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian Meredith: Hi, thanks. Two quick ones here. First, just curious on the EMEA organic revenue growth, the slow down we had in the fourth quarter, I know explained it, should we expect that it kind of continued into the first half of 2020 is from this leadership changes go on?
Dan Glaser: John, you want to take that?
John Doyle: Yes, I think, Brian there is still some headwinds in the first quarter for sure, but as I noted earlier I think that underlying performance works the way through or cut through some of the integration level with headwinds, I think we will see improved performance drop for the rest of the year. By the way, in the middle east, terrific growth year on last year, good solid results in continental Europe as well.So, obviously it was somewhat hopeful that the U.K. economy will continue to pick up now there is more certainty around Brexit, so a number of different factors that will ultimately determine where we are and I’m quite encouraged by our team leading through all this change.
Dan Glaser: And also, just to bear in mind, the new leader in UK, he was a Marsh veteran. You know, he has worked for the firm for more than 30 years and ran Canada for us, had another big job, so it is not like somebody coming in and having to learn the roles. He knows the business very well and that – as we mentioned in previous calls, when we think about the short and mid-term, we are optimistic about Britain.Britain has sort of been through the radar over the last couple of years, but there is now clarity around Brexit and we have got new leadership in the UK where we are in many different businesses from large account and third to small commercial and we believe it is going to be a great business for us over a stretch of time.
Brian Meredith: Great. And then my second question, just hopefully just a quick one here. Could the coronavirus have any impact in your growth in the fourth quarter in your Asia Pacific business you think at all?
Dan Glaser: Yes. I mean we’re monitoring the situation closely like I’m sure everybody is and our primary concern is definitely the health of our colleagues and their families and we are doing everything we can to assist clients as they think through possible scenarios that can impact their business, but it’s just too early to see that as to whether there is going to be any impact on our business, Asia or otherwise. You know, we just have to see how this plays out in the coming weeks.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies for any closing remarks.
Dan Glaser: I like to thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning and certainly thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication, as well as our clients for their support. Hope everybody has a good day. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. That will now conclude today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-29 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. Third quarter 2019 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company’s website at www.mmc.com.Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially for those contemplated by such statements.For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our Earnings Release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC website.During the call today we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today’s earnings release.I’ll now turn over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Please go ahead.
Dan Glaser: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I’m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan.Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Unfortunately Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter is sick with the flu and cannot join us today. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations.We are pleased with our third quarter and year to-date results. We produced excellent topline growth in the quarter with underlying revenue growth across both segments and our EPS growth is tracking well with our expectation. We are generating strong results, while continuing to make progress on the JLT integration, and overall accommodation is progressing nicely.Our clients are beginning to see the power of our combined firm and we are demonstrating that we are better positioned to help them with their greatest challenges through our enhanced talent, capabilities and geographic footprint.We are meeting our expectations in terms of our financial target, revenue growth and colleague retention and our businesses are coming together. Co-locating our teams is a critical part of our integration, because it enables the cultures to coalesce as well as results in increased collaboration.To-date, we moved over 8,000 colleagues and by the end of 2019 nearly all colleagues will be sitting side-by-side in their respective areas of operation globally. We've also undertaken significant work to integrate our platforms. We now have nearly all of the JLT colleagues on our HR system and have integrated financial reporting as well as our email environment.This is possible because of the investments we've made over the years to harmonize our systems and strengthen our infrastructure. Our progress to-date makes me confident we will comfortably exceed our $250 million savings target over three years.As we have said from the beginning, our combination with JLT is about growth and the benefits this acquisition brings to clients, colleagues and shareholders. More and more we are working as one team for our clients.For example, colleagues from several Marsh JLT Specialty practices across multiple countries came together to provide a customized solution for a company managing a complex hydroelectric project. Through global collaboration and our augmented capabilities we handled all of the projects insurance requirement.In Guy Carpenter, our cyber insurance team won an RFP for a large U.S. regional carrier by demonstrating the strength of the combined organization. In Indonesia, a large manufacturer had been engaging carriers directly for their EH&B services, resulting in a sub-optimized outcome for the client.Mercer Marsh benefits, which includes former JLT colleagues reviewed the existing benefits and recommended critical changes to drive a better outcome. This resulted in new business for MMB, lower premium cost for the clients and a more optimized solution for our client's employees.We also continue to capitalize on opportunities to serve clients across our businesses. For example, we've recently leverage our collective strength to create a compelling global value proposition for an Asia-Pacific transportation company who is upgrading their infrastructure to a sustainable modern transportation network.We won the mandate by leveraging Marsh JLT Specialties construction and marine expertise, Oliver Wyman's transportation and public sector expertise and Guy Carpenter's risk transfer and alternative capital capability.During the process, we also introduced MMB, who was appointed to manage the employee benefit portfolio. Overall, I am proud of our company's progress, impressed by the hard work of our colleagues and grateful for the ongoing support of our clients.Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance pricing trends. Pricing is firming across a wide range of geographies and lines. The Marsh Global Insurance Market index saw an increase of nearly 8% in the third quarter compared with 6% in the second quarter and 3% in the first.Global property insurance and financial and professional lines saw the highest average renewal rate increases at 10% and 14% respectively. Casualty rates are up 1% on average, but mixed byline with excess casualty rates rising and worker's comp down.Note that the Marsh index skews to larger risk, which are seeing higher increases, although middle-market and small commercial insurance rates are up in certain geographies.Turning to reinsurance in the property catastrophe market, we've seen reinsurance rate increased throughout 2019 as a function of loss activity, geography and exposure increases. Overall, we are focused on driving the best outcome for our clients. In markets like these our capabilities and expertise shine through and become even more critical.Now let me turn to our third quarter financial performance. We delivered excellent results in the quarter with underlying revenue growth across both risk and insurance services and consulting. We were executing well, both delivering for clients while working through the integration of JLT.Total revenue was $4 billion, up 13% or 5% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 10% versus a year ago to $585 million, and the adjusted operating margin increased 10 basis points to 15.9%.Adjusted earnings per share fell 1% versus a year ago to $0.77 reflecting seasonality of JLT. Year-to-date adjusted EPS increased 6% to $3.47. In risk and insurance services third quarter revenue was $2.2 billion, an increase of 18%.Underlying revenue growth was strong at 6% in the quarter. This reflects 5% growth in Marsh, and 11% at Guy Carpenter, which was held by a true-up of a multiyear contract which Mark will discuss in more.RAS adjusted operating income increased 11% to $313 million, the adjusted operating margin was 17.4% reflecting JLT's seasonality. In consulting, third quarter revenue was $1.8 billion, up 8% compared with the year ago.Underlying revenue was up 4% for the quarter driven by underlying growth of 7% to Oliver Wyman and 3% in Mercer. Consulting adjusted operating income grew 9% and the adjusted margin expanded 50 basis points versus a year ago.In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter results and our progress integrating JLT. For 2019, we expect a solid first year as a combined company, underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion and solid growth in adjusted EPS.With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, Dan, and good morning. We had excellent quarter. Overall revenue grew 13% to $4 billion reflecting the meaningful step forward JLT represents for our firm. We generate strong underlying revenue growth of 5%, with 6% in RAS, 4% in consulting.Remember that underlying revenue growth in our communications and disclosures include JLT. Operating income in the quarter was $467 million, while adjusted operating income increased 10% to $585 million.Overall, our adjusted operating margin increased 10 basis points in the quarter with 16.9%, a good result given the seasonality of JLT. Adjusted EPS increased to $0.59 in the quarter and adjusted EPS with $0.77.For the first nine months of 2019 total revenue growth was 10%, with underlying growth of 4%. Our adjusted operating income grew 13%, our adjusted operating margin increased 110 basis points to 22%, and our adjusted EPS increased 6% to $3.47.Overall, our year-to-date performance leaves us well-positioned for a solid first year with JLT. In Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue grew 18%, $2.2 billion with underlying growth of 6%.RAS is now produced 5% or higher underlying growth in five of the last six quarters. Adjusted operating income increased 11% to $313 million, and the adjusted margin decreased 30 basis points to 17.4%.For the first nine months of the year revenue was $7.2 billion with total revenue growth 14% and underlying growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year was up 12% to $1.7 billion.At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.9 billion with underlying growth of 5% representing another strong quarter of growth. U.S. and Canada grew 6% on an underlying basis in the quarter. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter that U.S. and Canada delivered 5% or higher underlying growth.The international underlying growth was 3% with Asia-Pacific up 7%, EMEA up 2% and Latin America down 1%. First nine months revenue at Marsh was $5.8 billion with underlying growth of 4%. U.S. and Canada was up 5%, while international was up 3%.Guy Carpenter's revenue was $273 million in the quarter, underlying growth of 11%. Strength in the quarter was due to solid operating performance and the true-up of a multiyear contract, excluding the multiyear contract adjustment underlying growth was mid-single digits in the quarter.The first nine months of the year, Guy Carpenter's revenue was $1.3 billion with 4% underlying growth. In the consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was up 8% to $1.8 billion with underlying growth of 4%.Adjusted operating income increased 9% to $320 million and the adjusted margin increased 50 basis points to 18.11%. Consulting's underlying revenue growth for the first nine months of 2019 was 4% with consolidated revenue of $5.3 billion.Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year was up 13% to $916 million. Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter with underlying growth of 3%, health grew 7% in the quarter, the best underlying growth since the first quarter of 2018.Carrier underlying growth was solid at 5% and wealth underlying growth was flat with mid-single digit growth and investment management offset by a low single digit decline in our defined benefit business.Our delegated asset management business continues to show strong growth with assets under management increasing to $290 billion. For the first nine months of the year revenue at Mercer was $3.7 billion with 2% underlying growth.Oliver Wyman’s revenue was $505 million in this quarter with strong underlying growth of 7%. This was the fifth straight quarter of 7% or higher underlying growth at Oliver Wyman. Growth was solid across most regions with our financial services and health and life sciences practices showing particular strength. First nine months of the year revenue was $1.6 billion with 9% underlying growth.Turning to corporate, adjusted corporate expense was $48 million in the quarter. Based on our current outlook we expect approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter. Turning to the JLT integration, this is our second full quarter post closing and I couldn't be happier with the progress we've made to-date.Dan said, the integration is going well from an operational perspective and we are on track with our financial target. We continue to expect the transaction will be modestly dilutive to adjusted EPS for the first year, breakeven in year two will be accretive in year three.We are ahead of schedule on cost savings and associated restructuring charges. We expect to exceed the $250 million of run rate savings and $375 million of cost to achieve those savings. We currently plan to provide an update on our outlook for cost savings on our fourth quarter earnings call.During the quarter we incurred $133 million of interest expense. We expect around $130 million of interest expense in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter we reported $84 million of amortization which includes the JLT related amount as well as amortization from other transactions.Our overall view of amortization related to the JLT transaction is now $163 million annually. As a result, we expect total deal related amortization in the fourth quarter will be about $93 million.In aggregate, the financial impact of the JLT transaction is tracking well with our initial expectation. As we look to the four quarter there are few things to keep in mind. Marsh faces the tough underlying revenue comparison to a year ago and a continued impact on new business in JLT's seasonally strongest quarter.As a result we expect Marsh's underlying growth to moderate in the fourth quarter, but still be solid for the year. In addition, Oliver Wyman tends to be our most volatile business quarter-to-quarter as we've discussed in the past and our current outlook calls for a pullback in the fourth quarter. Overall however, Oliver Wyman is on track for a strong year.In terms of the fourth quarter adjusted operating margin, we expect strong margin expansion that is moderately higher than the pace year-to-date, which reflects expense savings and a seasonally strong quarter at JLT partially offset by the sale of JLT's aerospace business, which generated nearly all of its earnings in the fourth quarter.Turning back to the third quarter, we reported $118 million of noteworthy item mostly related to the JLT acquisition. Included in this total are $77 million of JLT integration cost, the largest category which is severance, $21 million of JLT acquisition related cost and $12 million of other restructuring cost mainly related to Mercer's program.Turning to investment income, on an adjusted basis with $3 million of investment income in the quarter and we continue to expect the contribution from investment income for the balance 2019 will be immaterial. On a GAAP basis investment income was $7 million in the quarter.Foreign exchange with the slight benefit to adjusted EPS in this quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be at $0.02 per share headwind in the fourth quarter.Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 25% compared with 25.3% in the third quarter last year. For the first nine months of the year our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.3% compared with 24.5% last year.Based on the current environment, we continue to expect the tax rate between 25%, 26% for 2019 excluding discrete item. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $12.6 billion or $12.2 billion excluding commercial paper.In September, we've repaid $300 million of senior notes that matured consistent with our deleveraging plans. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in March 2020 with $500 million of senior notes will mature.In the third quarter we repurchased 2.1 million shares of our stock for $200 million. Through nine-months we've repurchased 3.1 million shares for $300 million. We continue to expect to repurchase enough shares in 2019 to reduce our share count.Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $1.2 billion. Uses of cash third quarter totaled $486 million and included $53 million for acquisition, $233 million for dividend and $200 million for share repurchase.For the first nine months, uses of cash totaled $7.1 billion and included $6.1 billion for acquisitions, $655 million for dividend, and $300 million for share repurchase. Overall we're on track to deliver a solid year.With that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.
Dan Glaser: Thank you, Mark. So, Cleena [ph], we're ready to start the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Mike Zaremski: Hey, good morning. First question on the insurance brokerage side of the business; we're increasingly hearing from some of the larger corporations and insurers that the deal with, let's say, Fortune 500 space that pricing is much higher there than let's call it, the SME small and mid size space. I'm aware that Marsh's revenue contracts in that space are more fee-based. And I get asked lot of from clients how do we think about or how is the impact on to the broker when pricing is very high and in the large account space. And maybe you can give us a sense of are you seeing that as well that dynamic and historically have your fee rates, have they increased at a similar rates or maybe they're overall brokerage is organic rate of growth? Anything there would help.
Dan Glaser: Sure. So, I'll start and then I'll hand over to John to give you some more information. Maybe the first thing to know is that, we build the business to operate across cycles. Softening cycles usually last for a long time and there's periods of tightening which generally are much shorter in duration. And so every market is different. But we're built or geared based upon the cycle. You're right in saying that in the large account space, it skews a little bit, or a lot more to fee than to commission. But you have to bear in mind between fees we have discussions with our clients all the time with regard to the value that we're creating. Generally in a large account space it's always a year-over-year type of discussion. It's hard to get fees to increase as you could imagine in large account across the world you have procurement departments and risk management experts who negotiate on their behalf. When we look at it when John and I look at this overall, we were facing a mild headwind for a number of years going back a few years ago and maybe we've a mild tailwind today, but it's not material to the overall performance of the company. But John, you want to tackle that?
John Doyle: Sure, Dan. As you just said, I think it’s a modest tailwind at the moment. I think it's really important to keep in mind of course, there our role is to get the best outcome for the clients, regardless where we are in the pricing cycle. And a good chunk of our portion of our large account business is on a fee, for sure we also have the Marsh Risk Consulting which is a fee-based business and our benefits business which obviously is not subject to the P&C pricing cycle.At the moment middle market pricing is not moving up as much as large account pricing which we have more exposure to from a commission point of view. We're certainly working with our clients to mitigate the impact of price increases, in a lot of cases that -- whether it's in large accounts or in the middle market that maybe our clients retaining more risk. So it’s a challenging market in some segments. I don't consider it actually one market. It's a collection of markets. But it’s a great time for us with our tremendous talent. We have great talented colleagues and their capabilities to create value for our clients.
Mike Zaremski: Yes. I'll guess, I'll move to the one more on move to defined benefits. You mentioned low single digit decline there. I believe you're in midst of taking actions to try to improve that level going into 2020. And I guess related to given the big dip in interest rates year-to-date versus last year, does that business get a may be a pickup later in the year due to client activity kind of looking into their impacts to the pension funds from low rates?
Dan Glaser: So, Mike, I'll start with that and then hand over to Martine to give you more detail. Mercer has done a really nice job over several years essentially preparing themselves to be able to deliver high-quality services to the client while we're earning a good margin on the business in a secular decline of defined benefit pension plan. And so that's playing itself out. We're not surprised by the low single digit declines. Those declines we saw last year as well. Martine, do you have any further to add about the impact of interest rates and that sort of thing?
Martine Ferland: Yes of course. And as Dan just said, we – our wealth business is now composed of investment as much as the DB core benefits consulting. And indeed the economic conditions and the market conditions can influence the rhythm at which the employer will decide to deal with their DB plans. So there is a little impact of that. It is a temporary measure because over time these plans are getting closed by times and we are prepared for that.So, of course also the market conditions do impact our large investments, consultings and in particular our OCIO business. And there again we have a -- our clients maintain very balanced portfolio and therefore the impact is mitigated because we've asset classes across equity, fixed income and alternatives.
Dan Glaser: Thanks. Next question, please.
Operator: Next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. Good morning. My first question is just on Guy Carpenter. I know you guys said that there was a multiyear contract that did help the organic and ex that, it would it be in the mid single digits this quarter. But that still a nice pickup from where you guys were in the second quarter. I was hoping to get a little bit more color. Was that some new business wins? I know, Dan, you mentioned Cyber retention, because I think last quarter you had mentioned that there was an impact on new business from JLT. So just trying to get a sense of if things turn around a little bit in the third quarter?
Dan Glaser: Sure. And just to be clear. I'm happy to fill in with Peter any time here with double digit quarter. So – but yes, I was – you're right, it was a bit of a positive surprise to us in the third quarter. But bear in mind, it’s a small revenue quarter for Guy Carpenter. So it doesn't take much for an outsized quarter in either direction. JLT is going to continue to be a drag to underlying revenue growth as Carpenter rebuilds the new business pipeline, that something that takes multiple quarters to do. But that effort is already underway and so it's not going to last for years. It's temporary.And in the meantime, Carpenter's doing a great job, managing expenses, deliver earnings growth. We mentioned the multiyear contract true-up and we call it out not because it's unusual, but because it was large in a small quarter and that's why we've raised it, but it's a normal course of business type of situation.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks. And then in terms of the margins within RAS, JLT was a drag this quarter, but the margin still seems to be trending better than I would have expected. If you could give a little bit of color, I know you guys said saves running better than plan. Were the savings like directionally picked up Q3 to Q2 and then maybe it's some level of improved organic. I'm just trying to get a sense what's driving? Its sill pretty strong margins especially in a quarter where JLT loses money?
Dan Glaser: Yes. So overall the Marsh & McLennan had a pretty materially higher margins than JLT; both very high quality organizations, Marsh & McLennan benefited I think more from some of the scale and broader heft that we had in organization, but every intention was to convert JLT within Marsh & McLennan to Marsh & McLennan style margins and then look to growth from there.We're pleased with the margin expansions that we're having this year. I mean, we expected it. So as we talked going into the year we've said that we expected to have margin expansion. And it really is about – we're bringing in more revenue and we're doing it in a more efficient way. So the notion that we feel comfortable at this stage which is still really early stages of coming together as a single organization that we will comfortably exceed to $250 million of expense savings that we cited last September when the deal was announced. As we've mentioned before we believe the majority of those savings are going to drop to the bottom line. And so we're seeing that right now.And as you can expect, even though JLT, the acquisition itself was not an expense synergy play. It's all about growth. We feel very happy with the level of talent and capabilities, the opportunities for colleagues that are developing and we expect revenues and earnings over time to be better as a result of this combination. But having said all that, we're a well-run organization and when we see areas for capturing efficiencies areas like real estate, technology, functions like finance, legal, HR, risk compliance, all gave us areas to where we believe we can be more efficient together. So what we'll do.As Mark was mentioning in his script, we'll give a more fulsome update next quarter about where we see the three year expenses and cost of achieving those expense saves. We'll do a review internally and we'll let you know next quarter. Next question please.
Operator: We will now take the next question from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill Partners. Please go ahead.
Paul Newsome: Good morning. Couple of follow-ups. The issues with the comparison for organic growth in Marsh in the fourth quarter, will that also extend into the first quarter next year given how strong the organic growth was in the first quarter? Or is that not the right comparison, obviously, the JLT deal makes that little bit more complicated?
Dan Glaser: Yes I mean, overall we're pleased with the year to-date performance of not only Marsh but RAS and the overall firm, the consulting segment as well. And we believe the way to evaluate the firm both on the top line and on the bottom line is over multiple quarters. We're not looking at any one quarter. Although having said that, we'll bask in the glory of a terrific third quarter for a little bit of time, but ultimately 2019 is shaping up to be a solid year especially in view of the effort of so many people within the organization who are working on integration efforts. And those are people who are legacy Marsh & McLennan and legacy JLT. We are all working together increasingly as one team to form a new organization that's quite formidable into the future. We wanted to call out the fourth quarter just because we expect it to be more challenging.We mentioned the importance of new business and new business pipeline. Well, the fourth quarter is JLT's highest new business quarter. So if you play out that logic well then there'll be more strain in terms of achieving what they used to achieve because of pipeline issues that develop soon after the announcement was made. Those things are all solvable. Now whether we extend our view into next year or not, I mean John do you have any early read?
John Doyle: Look, I think you said it well, Dan, that the fourth quarter was such a seasonally strong new business quarter for JLT, so we'll see a little bit more headwind there in the fourth quarter. But we're well-positioned for growth in 2020. So again if you take a longer view, we're confident that where we're positioned in the market.
Dan Glaser: Anything else, Paul.
Paul Newsome: Yes. Just making a really more of a modeling question. There's a fair amount of disposals happening. Obviously you had the aerospace business. It looks like the international business was where the disposals were. How should we think about that little piece going forward when we're trying to get to our organic growth or overall revenue growth estimates into that change with JLT?
Dan Glaser: Yes, Paul. There was a lot of -- the third quarter was noisy in that underlying growth schedule. And there were there are a couple of places There's the sale of aerospace that you mentioned. There was also the sale of a data business in Marsh last year where a gain was recorded in revenues. So there's a little bit of a heavier impact. If you look at the year to-date schedule you'll see a plus one for acquired revenue and that's probably not a bad estimate for the full year. But there's actually -- a lot of the transactions we did this year. so Lovitt & Touche and Bouchard and MMA came relatively early in the year.So there's less roll over revenue just given the lower activity this year than we would typically have. So maybe a little bit of rollover into the early part of next year and then next year's acquired growth, it would depend on the level of deal activity. Next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Yaron Kinar: Hi. Good morning. First question is really I guess follow-up on Elyse's question. Just trying to get a sense of what the cost save impact was in the third quarter and maybe even year to date?
Dan Glaser: Yes. We're not going to go into the details of how the cost saves are breaking out per quarter. As I mentioned before this is still really early stages, we're in the second quarter of being a combined company. We believe we have a multiyear approach to capturing the expense savings that we were identifying. We're executing on a lot of different issues right now. I mean, clearly with our margins being up as a company through nine months, pretty much we can say that, we're achieving a lot of savings, right? And it's not impacting growth because we're growing well as a firm. And so, I don't really want to get into a quarter-by-quarter description of all the activity we're doing on the expense side.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. Can you at least comment on whether it's more -- if the cost saves should be expected to be more back weighted than front weighted?
Dan Glaser: No. I mean, I think there's partly is what you're seeing in margin right now. Like we're jumping on efficiencies and making savings as we go and so there's not a sense of like all this is going to happen in the third year. I mean, there's many things that we can operate very quickly on. There's other things that take a little bit more time. You take something like as an example the consolidation of vendors or real estate or reducing costs within JLT that were geared to being a public company. Those sort of things we can move pretty quickly on.There's other areas, let's say some areas of application technology which take a little bit more time as they go. But we have a three-year plan and we're working through it and we expect to have, I mean, this is our 12th year margin expansion, so I'm not going too far out on a limb when I say. Well, I think in 2020 we're going to expand our margin just like we did in 2019 and just like we've done for the last 12 years. And so that's an indication of some of the benefits dropping to the bottom line.
Yaron Kinar: Okay, understood. And my second question goes to the casualty business and Marsh. I guess one thing I struggle with is and this isn't a Marsh issue, it's a broader industry question. I guess we're seeing rate firming, excluding workers comp even as loss picks excluding commercial auto remain pretty low by historical standards. I'm assuming that's something that you as a broker see as well. And just curious as to how much pushback there is in the conversations with insurance on the absence of more material loss trends? Or is it -- or are you actually seeing real time loss trends picking up in claims and margins and maybe not pushing back as much?
Dan Glaser: John, do you want to handle that one?
John Doyle: Sure. The underwriting community is clearly concerned about rising loss cost trends. Dan and I and some of the rest of our leaders have been at Peter Hearn as well have been at number of different conferences where we've spent a lot of time with the markets of late. So -- and there are clearly some very, very large casualty losses in the markets where there's a lot of discussion of course about cap property, but there are some casualty cat events that are in the market that are concerned. And then there's some big headline, verdicts and settlements that have underwriters concerned as well.I think we've seen loss cost trends begin to emerge more quickly. Commercial auto pricing has been up there for a number of different quarters. Overall casualty pricing at the moment is mixed. Work Comp is down five GL primary GL pricing is still down modestly including in the United States, but excess liability is up 6% versus 3% in the second quarter and that market seeing a bit more stress at the moment. So we of course again are trying to get the best outcome for our clients and we'll find solutions no matter where they might be in the world.But I do expect upward pricing pressure to continue throughout next year. However I think we'll see shorter and shallower cycles than we have on average in the past, so really kind of micro cycles. Underwriters are moving quickly to get better data, better management information. They're moving more quickly to deal with things. But capital moves very quickly to where profit pools emerge as well. So again I expect more shallow and shorter pricing cycles.
Dan Glaser: I mean that's really, I think John's point is really important to emphasize here. Better management teams at underwriting firms, better data and analytics creates more of a micro cycle environment where it's not necessarily broad across all sectors and all segments. And that's really occurring on the reinsurance side as well. We're not seeing broad market wide impact even as a result of the loss creep that we've seen over the last six months coming in from prior years and some big losses this year. But there is potential significant changes on individual programs based upon the individual programs characteristics like geography performance in the past and that sort of thing. So I think the better data and analytics are making it more of a targeted approach as opposed to broad brush. Next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Crystal Lu: Hi. This is Crystal Lu in for Ryan Tunis. So our first question is about the EMEA organic growth. It seems to have been improving recently. Can you just give some comments on what drove organic growth improvement there?
Dan Glaser: Go ahead, John.
John Doyle: Sure. I would say first of all overall I was pleased with the growth in the quarter at 70% GAAP growth, 5% underlying growth. Mark talked about the strong consistent growth in the United States. So internationally we're up 3% on a rolling basis. In EMEA we have very good results in continental Europe. We had excellent growth in the Middle East then in Africa as well. In the U.K., our results are showing some positive momentum. As I've talked about in the past we've made some leadership changes there. It's a challenging environment. Obviously the U.K. economy creating a bit of a drag force at the moment. But our leadership team is really on it and so I see some improving trends there of course as we look into next year.
Crystal Lu: Great. And then on the retention compensation that's coming through. Can you give an idea of what kind of quarterly level we should expect on retention compensation going forward? And when we can expect these payments to be concluded? Thanks.
Dan Glaser: Yes. I mean it's in the context of acquisitions that we've done in the past it's quite common for us to either have earn out arrangements or to have some sort of retention payments tied to a multiyear view of how a person performs within the business. And so we view that is as kind of normal. It's all been modeled within our original deal consideration. You'd expect that to really be more in the first year or 18 months and then reduced from there because it is geared towards assisting in the transition of the organization to a new organization. And so I wouldn't expect any significant levels to persist over a many year period. Next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from David Styblo from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Styblo: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just hoping we could peel back the onion little bit more on the cost saves and if you can provide additional color about the increased level that you're expecting to achieve in any out year there. Is that more of just finding more opportunities within the same subset or there just some new things that are emerging and to the extent that tying that to the accretion guidance. Is it a situation where maybe you just don't want to comment yet on perhaps doing better than break even next year or perhaps should we expect that there might be an update where there could be some upside to the breakeven target for next year?
Dan Glaser: I mean in any large organization and in any large combination there's a series of puts and takes. And I think this is how you need to view this. And that we did not know on the day of acquisition that we would have to dispose of the aerospace business as an example. On the other hand, we had an idea that $250 million or so of expense synergies should be achievable over a three-year period. So the fact that we're able to achieve more than that, but at the same time we've had some disposals that we did not anticipate. And I can tell you there's probably a dozen of these puts and takes that you look forward. And we end up about where we're exceeding our expectations mildly on virtually every measure and we end up with the view that it's going to be on an adjusted basis slightly dilutive to what we otherwise would have done this year, breakeven next year and accretive in year three. And so that's kind of where we are.The organization for a long period of time has become more and more efficient. We continue to see ways of becoming more efficient. And we run ourselves very much to where we've got four very strong brands, but we're not a holding company just operating a business that is not cohesive, where we are close to the client we're commercially agile, nimble, highly segmented, highly specialized. The further you are away from the client we're more horizontal and we capture synergies around finance, legal H.R. and other functional costs. We're smart about how we approach the use of service operations in places like India and Poland, in Kuala Lumpur and we will continue to do that. Personally I think we're at the early stage of being able to look at AI, machine learning, robotics as a way to increase the efficiency of the business. And so that we can look out for several years and believe we can continue to expand margins in the business.
David Styblo: Great. That's helpful to frame it. Thanks for that, Dan. Maybe a follow-up for a Mark real quick. Do you have a maybe some initial thoughts about how we should think about capital deployment in 2020? Would it be maybe perhaps the same approach for 2019 where you'd buy enough stock to help shares come down a little bit while paying down debt and opportunistically looking for M&A Or would there be any noticeable changes from how you approach this year?
Mark McGivney: Yes. David going back to as with a lot of things that we said initially that things are playing out very, very close to where we initially thought they would and that that applies to capital management as well. So this year is played out almost exactly as we thought. If you remember back to some of the things we said, we said the focus for capital management for the first couple of years would be deleveraging, but in those plans that we provided enough flexibility for return of capital as well as M&A with the focus for M&A being on Marsh & McLennan Agency.And so, as we look out to 2020 they're really still is the focus. That we're focused on the deleveraging and that we see -- we've provided for some flexibility so that we will be able to have some return of capital as well and continue to focus on M&A, really the balance between those two is just going to depend on the strength of the M&A pipeline.
Dan Glaser: Yes. I think it's important to remember, the way we prioritize our capital deployment is we put organic investment ahead of everything else that we put our dividend which we believe is sacrosanct. Then we've made a commitment to increase our dividend double digit each year and we intend to continue to do that. We have said in the past that we favor acquisitions over share repurchase and we favored share repurchase over growing cash on our balance sheet.So when you look at it in that context you have to recognize that that if push came to shove, we would favor acquisitions over share repurchase. And the way we're looking at our pipeline is very strong. And so we will continue to take steps to make us a stronger company. And if that means that that puts a little pressure sometimes on share repurchase then so be it. Next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead.
Meyer Shields: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Two very quick questions. First, can you give us a sense as to what clients are assuming for exposure in a growth as they do their 2020 planning?
Dan Glaser: Well, that's a good question and a tough one. So John, I don't think clients are assuming you need exposure. They have their own units of exposure growth. But I would say is that in some of the more mature economies that we operate in where we have big revenue stream. There continues to be particularly there in the United States, modest exposure grew up. So employment continues to grow. Sales are growing. The number of vehicles on the street more flat for example, but most areas of exposure management in mature markets are showing some modest growth.
Meyer Shields: Okay.
Dan Glaser: Go ahead. Next question, Meyer.
Meyer Shields: So, I'm just going to ask, with regard to the Guy Carpenter true-up, does all of that adjustment fall to the bottom line? Or they're offsetting expenses?
Dan Glaser: That's a great one. Mark, do you want to handle that. I mean, there's always the bonus pool. So nothing fully drops to the bottom line.
Mark McGivney: Our bonus pools tend to be geared to earnings, but other than that it really does fall into the quarter.
Meyer Shields: Okay. Thanks so much.
Dan Glaser: Sure. Our next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian Meredith: Yes. Thanks. First one just curious Lat-Am, negative organic, I think it's the first time I've ever seen that out of the Lat-Am business. Is that related to JLT or something else happened there?
Dan Glaser: Yes. So you're right in citing that. I mean this is the first quarter of negative growth in Lat-Am since we started reporting Lat-Am in the first quarter of 2008. It's a great region for us and it's usually neck and neck over long stretches of time with Asia as to which growth is better. But there's some particular issues that we're facing in Lat-Am in the short term. But John you want to give more color.
John Doyle: Sure. It is Legacy JLT related. It's both new business so we've talked about kind of more broadly and to larger non-recurring items in the region of where I would say though that the region absolutely remains a growth market for us. I'm really encouraged by how the teams are coming together at both Marsh and JLL. Well, it'll be a choppy second half for Latin America. I do expect good growth from the region in 2020.
Brian Meredith: Great. And then, Mark just curious, a pop in CapEx in the quarter looks like $123 million. Was there something kind of unusual going in that and also in that free cash flow actually was pretty strong. Or was there anything unusual maybe in operating cash flow?
Dan Glaser: Mark.
Mark McGivney: Yes, sure. Let me tackle CapEx first. It did increase. It was mainly related to timing of big real estate projects and that we can see that volatility from year-to-year and actually for -- it will not remain at that level into the fourth quarter. And fourth quarter we're probably looking more in line with what we saw in the fourth quarter over the last couple years. So it's just a couple of big real estate projects. It’s actually level in Q2 was a little bit lower for the same reason. In terms of cash flow growth is actually a really good story and what our operating cash flow notwithstanding all of the integration related charges was only down 2%. I thought that was a really good result in the context of what we're going through. So there is nothing unusual in that.
Brian Meredith: Right. Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from Larry Greenberg from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.
Larry Greenberg: Thanks and good morning. I'm not sure there's anything else to ask specifically on your quarter. So I'm just curious with social inflation being the big topic in the underwriting world. I wonder if you guys could either take your intermediary experiences or go back to your underwriting days and maybe just give your perspective on what's going out there and whether there's any analogies you would draw to past periods where the industry might have experienced some of these similar challenges?
Dan Glaser: John has forgotten more about underwriting than I ever knew. So John, you want to take that?
John Doyle: Look, I think, I mean it's apparent to me that the underwriting committee is struggling to figure out what the trend line is, right? And much like I think I said pricing, it’s not one market, it's a collection of markets. I think the challenge is it's not one trend line, right. And so, as I said earlier there are some pretty big very material casualty losses in the market. And then you're seeing where you have kind of more data and more frequency in commercial auto, a clear trend that's emerged over the course of the last several years.And in the case of auto it's got a shorter duration to it as than other liability lines. So it's quite again clear that they're trying to sort that out. But again our responsibilities serving our client and trying to come up with the best outcome for them in this market. But I would expect a bit more stress in the near term in the access liability market in particular. There are some areas where you can point to meaningful exposure changes, right. So in the case of D&O maybe for example, there's been a material increase in the frequency of securities claims that are in the market, right.That's obviously in the aggregate needs to be priced for. So there are some segments where you're seeing clear exposure changes then in other areas of risk could you see higher settlements and judgments for a lot of reasons.
Dan Glaser: Yes. I mean we were talking recently about worker's comp. I mean in tie for one reason or another and you can have a lot of opinions about what's underneath it. But in times of full employment worker's comp claims tend to go down and in times of economic stress they tend to go up. And so, it's sort of worker's comp claims are in decent shape now, but that doesn't mean it's a permanent trend line, and that may reverse with economic stress.
John Doyle: I would also point out, Dan. that after the financial crisis, we had a period where there wasn't real loss cost inflation, right? Claim transfer were quite stable, in fact, in some lines of business there was deflation which isn't what we normally observe over a long period of time. But clearly we've come out of that environment.
Dan Glaser: Anything else Larry?
Larry Greenberg: No. That's good. Thank you.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies for any closing remarks.
Dan Glaser: Sure. Thanks Cleena. And I just want to thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning. I want to express my gratitude to our 75,000 colleagues for the commitment and hard work that they show us all the time, as well as to our clients for their support. Thank you all very much and we'll speak to you next quarter.
Operator: That will conclude today's call. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-30 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded.Second quarter 2019 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company’s website at www.mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially for those contemplated by such statements.For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our Earnings Release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC website.During the call today we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today’s earnings release.I’ll now turn over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Please go ahead.
Dan Glaser: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I’m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan.Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations.We are pleased with our second quarter results, which include JLT for the first time. Since we closed the acquisition on April 1, we are often running with our leadership in place and our teams in formation, working together to serve clients with greater expertise, capabilities and content.We have more conviction than ever that the acquisition better positions us to help our clients with their greatest challenges. JLTs impressive talent has added to our thought leadership and ability to innovate. We’ve added about 10,000 colleagues to the organization, resulting in the broadest and deepest talent base in the industry. JLT has made us stronger in several specialty areas and has deepened our footprint in the faster growing geographies of Asia Pacific and Latin America, and JLT has enhanced ours scale.In the second quarter we grew total revenue by 16%, and RIS revenue by 23% compared to a year ago, despite a meaningful FX drag. This is a huge leap forward for our firm.Scale is becoming increasingly important and this combination extends our position, as the leading firm in the areas of risk, strategy and people. However as I said last quarter, size and scale aren’t everything; quality, capability and responsiveness of what really mattered to clients, and on max score we deliver world class service one client at a time.We’ve been hard at work on this integration since the day we announced the transaction, and post-closing we shifted aggressively from planning to execution. Mark will update you on some of our guidance items, but broadly speaking, things are tracking well with our expectations.We moved quickly to integrate our financial reporting and from the first month after closing, began viewing our results on a combined basis throughout the firm. We are beginning to realize efficiencies and are meeting our milestones in terms of cost savings.We are acting swiftly to integrate our teams and shared facilities around the world. We’ve already moved and co-located 5,000 of our colleagues in several cities, including London, Hong Kong, Sydney and Johannesburg. By the end of 2019, we will have nearly all colleagues around the world sitting side-by-side in their respective areas of operation. This involves a movement of 10,000 colleagues in 80 offices.Integrating our teams in this way is significant, because it enables our colleagues to come together for clients and coalesce into a single team. We have spent a lot of time understanding the respective cultures of JLT and MMC and are focused on bringing them together in a shared, more powerful firm.Our complementary strengths offer revenue growth potential, which we believe should enhance our long term growth profile. While these are early days and we’re not yet operating as a single team in all markets or lines of business, I still wouldn’t want to compete against them.We have already seen several examples where joint collaboration and the best content and solutions helped us to expand existing relationships and win new business. For example, our Marsh colleagues in Europe won business by presenting our combined capabilities to a client with a complex set of risks that required a combination of multinational expertise, specialty coverage, risk consulting and captive support.In the U.S. Marsh successfully retained and expanded the business of a large financial institution. By leveraging Marsh’s existing relationships and Marsh JLT specialty analytics, expertise and innovative solutions, the team added coverage’s for cyber and other specialty lines.In Australia where we have an $800 million business with nearly 4,000 colleagues, clients and prospects are reacting positively to the expanded capabilities of the combined organization. We retained two important risk clients by demonstrating the depth of talent and the benefits of the new value proposition, and we were able to extend our position to include Mercer.Guy Carpenter recently won an RFP for a top 10 U.S. insurer by leveraging a terror model developed by JLT Re, combined with the analytical capabilities of Guy Carpenter. Mercer Marsh benefits enhanced by the addition of JLT partnered on Britain’s Healthiest Workplace Launch taking the largest survey of its kind in the U.K. to clients. We also see potential in the medium term to improve reliability and efficiency by leveraging JLTs shared services operations in India. JLT adds 1,700 colleagues in India for Marsh & McLennan.In summary, we were off to a good start. The value creation that will be generated by the combined company is significant and we are excited about our future together.Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance pricing trends. Pricing is firming in specific lines and geographies, especially for complex risk or those with CAT exposure. The Marsh global insurance market index saw an increase of nearly 6% in the second quarter, compared with 3% in the first quarter and 2% in the fourth quarter of 2018.Property lines are seeing an average renewal price increase of 8%, with US up 10%. Casualty prices increased for the first time since 2013 and saw average renewal rate increases of 1% in the second quarter.Financial and professional lines saw average renewal rate increases of 10% in the quarter, with the U.S. up 7% and U.K. and Asia Pacific up double digits. Note that the Marsh index skews to larger risks and we generally see less movement in the middle market.Turning to reinsurance, at the mid-year 2019 renewals which primarily focuses on U.S. hurricane exposed programs, multiple factors came together to result in double digit property catastrophe rate increases in Florida on average for the first time in over a decade. This was driven by loss creep from the 2017 and 2018 loss events, reduced capital inflows and involving views of risk. Ultimately we can’t predict the mid to long term outlook for pricing, but the current conditions are firmer almost across the board.Now let me turn to our second quarter financial performance. We delivered solid combined results in the quarter, with underlying revenue growth across both risk and insurance services and consulting. We are executing well, both delivering for clients while working through the integration of JLT.Consolidated revenue was $4.3 billion, up 16% or 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 19% to $894 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 150 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share grew 7% to $1.18.In risk and insurance services, second quarter revenue was $2.6 billion, an increase of 23%. Underlying revenue growth was 3% in the quarter, reflecting 4% growth in Marsh, despite a tough comparison to a year ago, partially offset by a decline at Guy Carpenter.The declining in Guy Carpenter’s underlying revenue growth is a combination of timing and a decline in our new business pipeline. Not surprising for an acquisition of this size, JLTs new business slowed considerably during the period between deal announcement and closing. This impacted Marsh and Guy Carpenter, but was felt more acutely in reinsurance.Although it will take time to rebuild the new business pipeline, we are confident in the long term growth outlook for our combined business. RIS adjusted operating income increased 21% to $641 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points versus a year ago.In consulting, second quarter revenue was $1.8 billion up 9% compared with a year ago. Underlying revenue was up 5% for the quarter, driven by strong underlying growth at Oliver Wyman of 13%, while Mercer generated 2% underlying revenue growth. Consulting adjusted operating income grew 14% and the adjusted margin expanded 130 basis points versus a year ago.In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter results and our progress integrating the JLT acquisition. At a high level, we are tracking success in this period across three primary dimensions: growth, achievement of cost savings and retention of key talent and across each of these categories we are satisfied with our performance to-date.For 2019 we expect a solid first year as a combined company, underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion and solid growth in adjusted EPS.With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, Dan, and good morning. Our second quarter results represent a solid first quarter following the close of the JLT acquisition. Overall revenue grew 16% to $4.3 billion due to the addition of JLT beginning on April 1 and solid underlying growth of 4%. Note that underlying revenue growth in all of our communications and disclosers includes JLT.Operating income in the quarter was $680 million, while adjusted operating income increased 19% to $894 million. Overall our adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points in the quarter with significant margin expansion in both segments. GAAP EPS was $0.65 in the quarter; adjusted EPS increased 7% to $1.18.For the first six months of 2019, underlying revenue growth was 4%, our adjusted operating income grew 14% and our adjusted EPS increased 9% to $2.70. Overall, our adjusted margin increased 160 basis points to 24.4% for the first half of 2019.In Risk and Insurance Services, second quarter revenue grew 23% to $2.6 billion with underlying growth of 3%. Operating income increased 10% to $517 million. Adjusted operating income increased 21% to $641 million and the adjusted margin increased 80 basis points to 27.8%. For the first six months of the year revenue was $5 billion, underlying growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income for the first half of the year was up 13%.At March, revenue in the quarter was $2.2 billion with underlying growth of 4%, representing a solid first quarter with JLT, especially considering the tough comparison to a strong second quarter last year. U.S. and Canada continued its trend of strong growth with 5% underlying revenue growth in the quarter. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter that U.S. and Canada has delivered 5% or higher underlying growth.In international, underlying growth was 2% with Asia Pacific up 7%, Latin America up 4% and EMEA flat. For the first six months revenue in Marsh was $3.9 billion with underlying growth of 4%. U.S. and Canada was up 5%, while international grew 3%. Guy Carpenter’s revenue was $392 million in the quarter with an underlying declined of 3%.As Dan mentioned, the softness in the quarter was due to some quarterly variability, as well as a decrease in new business. For the first six months of the year revenue was $1.1 billion with 2% underlying grow. We are confident in Guy Carpenter’s long term growth outlook, but expect current trends will impact revenue growth for the balance of 2019.Guy Carpenter is executing its integration and cost savings plans, which will help them deliver solid earnings growth in 2019.In the consulting segment revenue in the quarter was up 9% to $1.8 billion, underlying growth of 5%. Operating income increased 4% to $278 million. Adjusted operating income increased 14% to $305 million and the adjusted margin increased 130 basis points to 18%.Consulting’s underlying revenue growth for the first six months of 2019 was 4%, with consolidated revenue of $3.5 billion. Adjusted operating income for the first half of the year was up 16% to $596 million.Mercer’s revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, with underlying growth of 2%. Wealth underlying growth was flat with mid-single digit growth in investment management offset by a low single digit decline in our defined benefit business.Our delegated asset management business continues to show strong growth, with assets under management increasing to $283 billion, benefiting from continued inflows, market appreciation and assets from JLT.Health increased 4% on an underlying basis in the quarter and Career underlying growth was strong at 6%. For the first six months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $2.4 billion with 1% underlying growth.Oliver Wyman’s revenue was $540 million in the quarter with impressive underlying growth of 13%. Growth was broad based by practice and geography. For the first six month of the year revenue was $1.1 billion with 10% underlying growth.Turning to corporate expenses, adjusted corporate expense was $52 million in the quarter. Based on our current outlook, we expect approximately $50 million per quarter for the remainder of this year.We are just over 100 days post the closing of JLT and are moving forward rapidly with the integration. We continue to expect the transaction will be modestly diluted to adjusted EPS in the first year, break even in year two and to be accretive in year three.At this point we expect at least $250 million of run rate cost savings and $375 million or more of costs associated with achieving these savings. Of the $250 million of cost savings, we expect to realize roughly $75 million in 2019, $175 million at 2020 and the full $250 million in year three. In terms of the $375 million of costs to achieve these savings, we expect to incur roughly half in 2019 with the remainder incurred evenly over the next two years.During the second quarter we incurred $141 million of interest expense, and continue to expect around $140 million in the third quarter, consistent with our previous guidance.As disclosed in our supplemental materials released on June 6, we now expect annual deal related amortization from the JLT transaction to be $180 million pretax. In the second quarter, we recorded $100 million of amortization, which includes the JLT related amortization, as well as amortization from other transactions.Approximately $80 million of the $100 million was recorded in RIS and $20 million in consulting. We currently expect the third quarter amortization will be roughly consistent with the level in the second quarter.In aggregate, the financial impact of the JLT transaction is tracking well with our initial expectations. In the second quarter we reported $280 million of noteworthy item, mostly related to the JLT acquisition. Included in the total, are $98 million of integration costs, the largest category of which is severance; $150 million of charges associated with the closing and the refinancing of JLT debt, and $26 million of other restructuring costs mainly related to Mercer.Turning to investment income, on an adjusted basis we had $6 million of investment income in the quarter, and we continue to expect the contribution from investment income for the balance of 2019 will be immaterial.On a GAAP basis investment income was $8 million [ph] in the quarter. Foreign exchange was at roughly $0.02 per share headwind to adjusted EPS in the quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect $0.01 per share of FX headwinds in each of the third and fourth quarters.Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 25.9% compared with 25.2% in the second quarter last year. Through the first half of the year, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.1% compared with 24.3% last year. Based on the current environment, we continue to expect the tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2019, excluding discreet items.Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $13.1 billion or $12.6 billion excluding commercial paper. During the quarter we refinanced the remaining $550 million of senior notes assumed from JLT, using mix of cash and additional $300 million one year term loan.Our next debt maturity is in September 2019 when $300 million of senior notes will mature. At this point our expectation is that we will retire these notes with cash-on-hand, in line with our planed deleveraging over the next couple of years.In the second quarter we repurchased 1 million shares of our stock for $100 million. We continue to expect to repurchase enough shares in 2019 to reduce our shift.Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $1.3 billion. Uses of cash in the second quarter totaled $6.1 billion and included $5.8 billion for acquisition, $212 million for dividend and $100 million for sharing repurchase.For the first six months uses of cash totaled $6.6 billion and included $6.1 billion for acquisitions, $422 million for dividends and $100 million for share repurchase. In May our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of $41.05 to $45.05 per share an increase of 10%.Overall we expect 2019 to be a solid first year with JLT. We are on track to achieve good underlying revenue growth, meet our integration savings targets and deliver margin expansion and solid growth in adjusted EPS. As you think ahead to the remainder of 2019, keep in mind that JLT has heightened seasonality, as shown in the supplemental quarterly materials we released on June 6. Their first and third quarters were seasonally smaller, while their second and fourth quarters were seasonally stronger.With that, I’m happy to turn it back to Dam.
Dan Glaser: Thanks Mark. Operator, we are happy to go to the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Mike Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Michael Phillips: Good morning. Thank you and congrats on your first quarter with the acquisition under your belt. My first question, lots of moving parts obviously with JLT. I guess could you comment on the impact of the margins in the quarter from the aviation business that you sold?
Dan Glaser: Yeah, I mean at the end, the aerospace business that we sold would have had a very negligible impact on the margin in this quarter. The reality of that business is that’s a very big fourth quarter business, but it’s a much smaller throughout other parts of the year.
Michael Phillips: Okay, great, thanks. I guess secondly, you are still talking of kind of the long term organic growth of in the 3% to 5% range. How do we think about the impacts on your margins and how the margins can expand if you stay below 5% in that?
Mark McGivney: So a couple of things. One, when we think long term what we said before is we have been growing in the 3% to 5% range annually for the last decade and so until we are able to break out of that range, you know you are what your results say you are and we’ve been performing in that 3% to 5% range. That’s not to say we view our long term growth possibilities as somehow parameter based or bucketed within that range you know. We have aspirations to grow more than that clearly.Now, we have proven over a long period of time that we are able to grow margins within 3% to 5%, even when we are performing at 3% growth. I mean our key to expansion is the way we run the business, where revenue growth almost always exceeds expense growth and we’ve done that consistently. And so you know over a period of 12 years we are now in the 12th consecutive year of margin expansion. So I feel comfortable that this leadership team will be able to continue to grow margins by growing our revenue faster than growing our expense into the future.Next question please.
Operator: We’ll now take the next question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the margin within RIS in the quarter. You know pretty – a lot stronger than what I had expected. So if you could just help us understand, now I know you guys gave us some financials for JLT last year and based off of that, I would have thought that that would have been a drag on your margins, because they run lower than historical RIS.Could you just give us a sense of what drove that? Was it you know how much phase came through in the quarter? Was it employees that potentially left after the deal closed. I’m just trying to tie together you know the moving parts that drove pretty strong margin improvement within RIS?
Dan Glaser: Yeah, sure. As we said earlier, we expected margins to expand this year for the company and we set that going into the year and that is our expectation, so this was not a big surprise to us.I would caution everybody as we’ve done in the past, not to look at margins in any one quarter, but look over a length of time, either on a you know annual basis, rolling 12 months, etcetera, because there are puts and takes in every quarter that impact margins.You know when we talk about – we’re not going to detail individual cost savings and what’s dropping to the bottom line, although you know it’s fair to say that a lot of our cost saves in the $250 million or the at least $250 million will drop, because you know as you sited JLT ran their business at a lower margin than Marsh & McLennan did and our view is that we will bring the combined business to the margins of Marsh & McLennan and expand from that point in time, and that’s why you are seeing some expansion now.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay thanks. And then my second question, you know reinsurance, Guy Carpenter declined in the quarter, you know I think both of you guys in your prepared remarks reference a lower new business pipeline or lower new business growth. If you can just expand on that, also could you give us a sense of the retention that you are seeing within both Legacy, JLT and Marsh & McLennan, just so we can get a sense of you know kind of the drag. I know you referenced you might see for the balance of, you know the balance of this year?
Dan Glaser: Yes, so I’ll take that and then I’ll hand over to Peter to give us a little bit more. You know I’d start by saying Guy Carpenter has been a terrific performer on multi-levels for us in many years, and in fact this negative quarter is only their second negative quarter in the last decade. You know and you cited, new business was the primary feature and so it’s quite common in acquisitions.We even see it in much smaller acquisitions within Marsh & McLennan agency, where post acquisition there is a little bit of a low for a period of time and so its natural. And certainly from deal announcement through to closing there was a period where the pipeline was beginning to weekend. This is correctable, it’s not going to take years, but then again it’s not going to take weeks and so there’ll be a period of time that we work it through and we’ll get the pipeline going again. So it’s not something that we are overly concerned with.And I would say the new business both for Marsh and for Guy Carpenter is vitally important. You know if you are a primary broker as an example and if you’re not growing your base by 10% or 20% of new business every year, you’re going to go backwards. And so you know it gives you the magnitude of the hill that we climbed successfully in my view with our RAS overall. But Peter, want to add some more color to that.
Peter Hearn: I think you’re absolute right, Dan. I mean, you know at least the reinsurance business typically has a long duration sales cycle and when you put any uncertainty or doubt into a buyer’s mind it’s going to impact the business pipeline, and that’s what we’ve seen from the legacy JLT business, and you know quite frankly what we’re doing is we are you know bringing the legacy JLT and Guy Carpenter sales processes together.We’ve had a very successful disciplined global sales model in Guy Carpenter, which has created you know significant results for us over the past 2.5 years and as Dan said, it’s not going to happen overnight, but in the short period of time we will ingratiate the JLT business into our business pipeline and grow it successful.
Dan Glaser: The other thing I would just add is Carpenter did a really nice job in the quarter in delivering bottom line you know and that's going to be the focus over the next couple of years. There was quite a spread between respective margins in the businesses and now our first order of business is to achieve Carpenter style margins on the combined reinsurance business. So it's a bit more for Carpenter unlike some of the other businesses. It's a bit more of a bottom line earnings focus as opposed to topline. We want both, but I'm just giving you a little bit more of the focus.Next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian [Inaudible]. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey thanks. I guess just following up here on Guy Carpenter, I guess I would have expected some of the revenue disruption to come from the revenue overlap you potentially had between those two businesses and it sounds like you’ve only really alluded to issues relating to new business. I was hoping Dan maybe you can give us some idea of you know, how many dis-synergies there? How much of that negative three might be stemming from that versus you know what you said on the new business side?
Dan Glaser: Yeah, no it’s a good. Certainly we've seen some revenue breakage, particularly in our I.S., but the magnitude of the revenue headwind for us was new business involved Marsh and Guy Carpenter. It’s just this fell more acutely in this particular quarter in Guy Carpenter.Now we modeled a lot of revenue breakage in the deals, so you know things are tracking along with our expectation and so from that standpoint it'll be an issue that will work through over the next couple of years, but ultimately we feel we will be able to in most circumstance overcome that headwind.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it, and yeah, I mean as you said we can only see it in other places other than Guy Carpenter but there’s certainly also some overlap in London. If you broke out London separately, would we see something similar to the story plan on Guy Carpenter on the retail side?
Dan Glaser: I mean London is where we have the most levels of overlap. I mean on the insurance side it’s the capital of the insurance world you know, and so from that basis you would expect to see more overlap in London than you would see in other parts of the world.Next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from Larry Greenberg from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.
Larry Greenberg: Thank you and good morning. Dan, just you talked about pricing in the environment in property casualty. I mean without the JLT combination, do you think you would be characterizing the environment for underlying growth above you know that 3% to 5% historical range that you've been using.
Dan Glaser: I'm going to hand it off to John and Peter a little bit, to give a little bit more pricing commentary in general. But you know the 3% to 5% is sort of where we've been for a while pre-JLT and post JLT we’re saying the same thing. So I wouldn't view it as impactful on that and you know you could imagine you know from our standpoint we’re focused as a combined company. There is no us and them.We’re one organization, one set of expectations, one set of numbers as we move forward and I'm actually very proud of the organization, in being able to pull together that from the date it closed, from the first month looking at a single set of numbers, not trying to be well JLT would have been this and Marsh would have been that. It’s just one set of numbers, but John, you want to talk about the pricing environment a little bit more?
John Doyle: Sure. You know as Dan noted in his prepared comments, the market moved a bit in the quarter. Most regions and products saw increases in rate changes compared to the first quarter.As I said on the last call, market’s more challenging for some clients than it’s been you know quite some time. Dan shared the high level data. You know what I would say is our index skews a bit to large accountant and larger accounts with complex risks are the accounts that are moving the most; you know pricing, lead umbrella, property CAT, you know all high single digit range globally. The U.S. and Australia and the U.K. wholesale market are the geographies with the highest level of increases.But I would say that you know the SME markets, the upper middle market, you know pricing is much more muted on average in effect. It’s in the low single digit range or even flat to down in some products and in some markets.So you know we’re seeing signs of lost cost inflation and exposure shifts in certain classes; DNO, EPLI, cyber, commercial order you are seeing an increase in frequency and severity. There's some very, very big losses in the market, so. You know the industry remains very well capitalized, but some are reducing their risk appetite and moving attachment points and moving pricing. So you know that’s what we see at March here.
Peter Hearn: You know I think as DAN said in his comments, it's very specific to lines of business and geographies in some areas of the world. Take Florida, we saw significant increases at 61 on Japanese with the exposed metric, the exposed business, there were increases, but they were all responsive based on exposure and loss. They weren’t like it as we've seen in previous cycles.I think the other thing it's important to note to is that insurance and reinsurance pricing are sort of moving in synchronicity. It is in the top down reinsurance pricing being forced on the primary business, primary rates rising as reinsurance rights respond to the underlying growth of premiums as well.
Dan Glaser: Thanks. Anything else Larry?
Larry Greenberg: Yeah Dan. I think one thing that you know investors will be struggling with and trying to tackle is just how long these headwinds, particularly at Guy Carp are going to persist? And I know it's impossible to say with precision, but would you venture some sort of time frame for you know when some sort of inflection may arise where you know that was yesterday's conversation and now we're having a new conversation about growth.
Dan Glaser: Yeah, as you say, it is near on impossible to take something like that. What I can say is that there's no finer leadership team of this combined organization and that you know execution capability has been proven over a long period of time.As I mentioned before, this will not take years, but then again it won't take weeks either. This will be a period of time that we come together as one firm. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are not operating as a single team in every geography and every line of business. That is a process you know, this is real life you know and so I would say that even given that headwind that we’ll have to absorb and overcome over the coming months, I would not trade strategic positioning with any other firm in our competitive space.We have a mountain of talent and we will be able to deliver you know very interesting solutions to clients in the future years, so the best is certainly yet to come for this organization.Next question please.
Operator: Your next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead.
Meyer Shields: Great, thanks. Dan I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on your comments of Guy Carpenter; you being more bottom line focused. I guess specifically what I'm trying to understand is that if the new business pipeline is down and we accept the premise and new business is typically more expensive to originally obtain, then are there some expenses that would come back as the new business pipeline rebuilds?
Dan Glaser: Yeah, I think your basic premise there Meyer is not right. It's probably right in a lot of industries, but the reality is new business can be even more profitable. The marginal profitability is the mix account in our industry is quite high, because we're putting new revenue on existing infrastructure. We don't necessarily have to go out, hire new people, do more technology, etcetera. We can add revenue onto the existing expense base and so new business is profitable.
Meyer Shields: Okay, that’s actually very positive, thanks. And second, this is sort of unrelated to JLT, but I was hoping you could update us on the M&A environment.
Dan Glaser: Well, thank you for remembering we've got other parts of the company. John, you want to talk a little bit about what's going on Marsh & McLennan Agency.
John Doyle: Sure. M&A had a strong quarter and remains quite active in the M&A market and in fact you know MMA is our priority in the near term as we integrate JLT. There is a good pipeline. You know we've earned a favorable reputation, we are broadening our commitments and you know it gives us a really good shot, in many cases the first look you know at some really high quality firms that are in the market.You know we closed on Bouchard in Florida in the middle of the first quarter. We closed on Lovitt & Touche in Arizona, based in Arizona on April 1. You know both were top 100 firms in the United States, high quality businesses with really, really terrific leadership so, and we have a good strong pipeline you know as we look for as well, so we're excited about the prospects there.
Dan Glaser: Thanks John. Next question please.
Operator: Your next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning everybody. I guess getting back on the Guy Carpenter wagon, I think you had already mentioned some timing issues there. Can you maybe talk about what drove that timing issues and if you expect revenues to come back in the third quarter?
Dan Glaser: I’ll start, but ultimately I would say that the new business pipeline was larger than the timing issue, although timing did have an impact, but Peter you want to talk about that?
Peter Hearn: Yeah, I mean you know this is an inherently volatile business and buying decisions from one quarter the next can have an impact as we’ve seen. You know it probably was a function more of the market as it was buying decisions, because as the market is transitioning its taking longer and longer to price business and therefore renewals that should have happened in the second quarter are now leaning over into the third quarter.
Yaron Kinar: Okay and then as I think about the third quarter here, you know we only have one year of data for our JLT here on a quarterly basis. It seems like JLT’s margins were a little weak a year ago. Is that a good run rate to use as we think of forward estimates or is there something in particular that drove margins down last year?
Dan Glaser: Mark, you want to take that?
Mark McGivney: Yaron, I think if you refer back to the supplemental materials that we passed out and its why in my commentary I highlighted the seasonality. I would use 2018 as a decent baseball, and I don’t think there was anything unusual in JLTs results quarter-to-quarter. And the third quarter was seasonally weak estimates. If you look back to that statement, they actually had negative NOI in the third quarter just because of the different revenue.
Dan Glaser: Nest question please.
Operator: The next question comes from Paul Newsome from Sandler O’Neill. Please go ahead.
Paul Newsome: Good morning, congrats on the quarter. Just more of a follow-up here. The lag that we are seeing from that you talked about a lot, Guy Carpenter, but also seeing in Marsh, is that going to mainly come through the EMEA segment that seemed to be the segment that was a little bit slow and I guess should we essentially just think of your comments on Guy Carpenter as having – expecting similar behavior there?
Dan Glaser: Yeah, I mean if you look at the JLT organization, you know it’s almost 50% in the U.K. So rather than, you know really broad EMEA, of course the U.K. has been our EMEA, but it’s pretty focused on the U.K. more than any other factors as being; that’s where most of the yield overlaps occur, that’s were a lot of the flow goes into the London market replacement. But overall when we look at the geographies, it’s business as usual in places like Asia Pacific and we’re just you know continuing very rapidly to integrate the teams and work with clients and prospects.And so you know, I want to make it clear that any of the revenue headwind that we have faced was completely anticipated and if you go back to when we first made the deal announcement in the last quarter we spoke about, there’ll be a period of choppiness you know and delivering a 4% level of growth for the company, you know in that period of choppiness I view as being, very acceptable to us.And in fact you know the 4% growth from Marsh & McLennan in the second quarter is the first time we actually hit 4% growth in the last five years. I mean the last time was second quarter of 2014 and so there has been a period of time, so we feel we are doing pretty well in the circumstances.
Paul Newsome: I wouldn’t disagree. Is the lag effect that you talked about in Guy Carpenter, the balance of the year similar in for the Marsh impact?
Dan Glaser: You know it’s hard to say, but I would say, the way to look at this is that the new business impact in terms of pipeline applies to both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. It was felt more acutely by Guy Carpenter partly because the size, relative sizes in quarters.You know the other thing that you have to know, the revenue breakage is likely to take longer due to materialize. Even though we’re seeing some revenue breakage now, there’ll be other revenue breakage in the future, particularly in areas like third party business as an example or clients that have a view of having multiple brokers and they had relied on JLT and Marsh or JLT and Guy Carpenter in the past.You know they’d want to go find another broker if they want to have two brokers if they view that as part of their approach to the market. And so, you know think of it more along the lines of the new business lag will be regenerated based upon the efforts of Marsh and Guy Carpenter to recreate business pipelines, get people working together and that is very solvable and the revenue breakages is a short term to midterm phenomenon that will be a bit of a headwinds for us over the next couple of years, but we believe and even in those circumstances we will be able to grow our business in the 3% to 5% range organically as a company and deliver margin expansion.Next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Mike Zaremski: Hey, good morning. In John’s remarks about the P&C market, you described it as more challenging for some clients and it’s been for a long time and you guys made the point that it’s more a large account focused. I’m curious how was that impacting Marsh’s financials? I believe the large accounts faces more fee weighted rather than commission weighted. So how should we think about those dynamics?
Dan Glaser: John, you want to give us some more detail.
John Doyle: Sure, you know I think as the market, you know the overall market pricing dynamic has had some positive impact on the revenue growth of the company. But, as you know, most of the price increases are happening in this segment of market where we are paid largely on fees. So you know some of the business that migrates, the London market, so you know we get some wholesale left in that marketplace.You know I think the improved growth trajectory of Marsh over the last couple of years is also come, you know as our retention has improved and our fee business has improved as well. So we’re getting a little bit less from the market for sure, but I think we’re getting better as well.
Dan Glaser: Thanks. Okay question, I guess a follow-up.
Mike Zaremski: Yeah, one follow-up on cyber. Could you comment if whether you’d help us understand the size or maybe the growth dynamics going on with your cyber consulting business. We all know that cyber is growing a lot on the insurance side and I’m curious if there’s also growth coming from perhaps a cyber-consulting business that you have? Thanks.
Dan Glaser: Yeah, sure. So let me speak broadly for a second. As you mentioned cyber is a significant growth areas, viewed as one of the primary risk for almost all companies today regardless of where you’re located anywhere in the world and regardless of your size. You know everyone concerned with cyber, and certainly within our risk and insurance services business it’s one of our fastest growing practices and has been over the last several years and that to me is the road without end in terms of, you know there will be as the IoT and globalization continues and the technological advances and the pace of technological advance just continues to accelerate, we will see more and more risk exposure and risk awareness around that level of connectivity, and certainly Marsh and Guy Carpenter will be very helpful.Turning to your question on consultants, I’ll hand over to Scott McDonald, first at Oliver Wyman to address it, but Scott.
Scott McDonald: Yeah Mike, the business as you suspected I think is growing pretty rapidly on the consulting side as well. And there our advisory element of it, governance elements, technology pieces and that’s being thought I’d say by the boards, by the C-suites and by others on the management team.So it’s a very rapidly growing space, has been rapidly growing for the last few years, although it’s still relatively small for us; one of our fastest growing businesses.
Dan Glaser: Thanks. Next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian Meredith: Yeah, thanks. Just sticking with Oliver Wyman, I’m just curious the comps get little bit tougher second half of the year. Should we be expecting the same type of growth continuing in Oliver Wyman or should – big projects something happen in the quarter.
Dan Glaser: Brian, from your lips to God’s ears. I mean at the end – as we said many times before you know Oliver Wyman over like the last five years has been our fastest growing operating company on a CAGR basis, but it also has the most volatility.And so I think you have to look at a longer term period of time in order to evaluate their growth, in mid to high single digit is where they tend to grow over long stretches of time, but Scott you wanted to price me to the up-side or the...
Scott McDonald: Yeah, Dan covered most of it, but Brian I really appreciate the question as well. I was wondering what we had to deliver at Oliver Wyman, any other question. I like getting one. I mean we had a really good quarter which we are happy with. The interesting thing is that that strong right across the portfolio across almost all the industrial segment and across all of the regions, perhaps with the exception of Europe which has been slower.The economy still feels okay out there. I mean employment is good, but there is some slowing growth now in pocket in the world. There is some slowing business temperament and while we see our clients still interested in doing things around growth, technology, managing disruption, they continue to get more nervous.So we don’t see anything on the horizon that gets immediately tougher. But if you look at the results over the last few years, you know as Dan highlighted, we do fall up and down depending on where we put big projects and programs into the quarters. And I think this is pop-up so I wouldn’t expect it to continue at that level and the comp from last year is high.
Brian Meredith: Thanks, so just a quick one on JLT. In the expense saves guidance that you guys have provided, have you contemplated any type of retention, you know bonuses to try to keep producers from JLT or the combined organization, was there any impact to the quarter at all from retention bonuses?
Dan Glaser: Sure. So yeah, we clearly put into place a retention program for the combined company. You know at it includes people who are critical to our future, whether they work for JLT or whether they work from Marsh & McLennan. Obviously those were a little bit weighted towards JLT, because we wanted to you know have people give it a real chance.The program as you would expect is a multiyear program, and so it’s really more like a three year cliff-based retention program and we – it is in our deal model, we put a significant amount of – there is no significant impact in any quarter, you know since it’s over a three year period. And I would just say you know, that program is not viewed in our way as part of the cost saving program; that is more a securing the organization, securing future growth.You know yeah, I do want to say that because I know that a couple of you have had mentioned in the past that you’ve been reading about some level of staff departures from JLT etcetera and – as I said in my script, we’re evaluating the acquisition across three dimensions, really broadly on growth. So growth in power and capabilities, revenues, earnings, etcetera, expense savings clearly and also talent retention and we are satisfied across all three. Specifically on talent retention, sure there’s some people who have left who we would have preferred that they stayed with the organization.However you got to put that in context, the overall level of JLT voluntary turnover in the second quarter of 2019 is very consistent with the overall level of voluntary turnover within JLT in the second quarter of 2018 you know and so it’s running a little bit higher in the U.K. and it’s actually running lower than last year in the rest of the world. So in the context of talent retention, broadly we are quite satisfied.Next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from David Styblo from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Styblo: Hi, good morning, thanks for the questions. I just wanted to circle back at a broader view of the just the JLT financial impact that you guys compare. How things have progressed since you initially provided the EPS accretion solution over the three year time frame. The supplement that you provided, not too long ago give us an insight about the amortization being a little bit better and then the aerospace sale with the bad guy, but still seems like that was not good.I’m wondering if you could share any other details about moving parts that have been positive or negative, just because as we clean those financials it seems line net-net things are a little bit better than originally expected from a pro forma standpoint.
Dan Glaser: Yeah, let me headed over to Mark in a second, but you know there’s always going to be some puts and takes as you did into a business and you create a unique new company in combination. And so there are several things that have met with our expectations along with our original planning and a few which we are doing a bit better with. But Mark you want to add more to that?
Mark McGivney: Dave, I think what Dan said is right. It actually is – I t’s pretty remarkable if you go back to what we talked about last September and see how closely things are tracking in the aggregate. As I said earlier, at a high level we’re tracking very closely to the initial expectations.There’s been a lot of puts and takes. So you know you pick up something in one category give it back in another, but when it comes to the amount of debt we issued, the interest cost that we paid on that debt, the cost savings, the amount of revenue headwind that we are facing, all of these are tracking really well and that’s why we’ve been able to stick with, this guidance that we are still in this category of modern solution this year, breaking in by year two and accretive in year three and also that we are seeing the margin expansion that we said we would this year. So everything’s tracking really well.
Dan Glaser: And I’m particularly psyched about, you know when you look at RIS in particular up 23% in the quarter, in the company of 16% that’s a step change in growth for the overall company. And yes, we are focused on underlying growth and our ability to drive underlying growth, but every once in a while you get an opportunity to really change the trajectory of a firm and that’s not about underlying. So this is about total growth for the firm where we are very pleased. Do you have a follow-up?
Mark McGivney: I do, I don’t want to beat a dead horse on reinsurance, but on the other side, Canada, U.S. organic growth was a solid 5%, especially against the tougher comp of 8% a year ago. I guess trying to reconcile comments of just disruption from the deal and so forth. Curious what you are seeing in that business that’s holding up so well, to the extent that the market pricing dynamics have any impact and sustainability of that trajectory going forward?
Dan Glaser: Thanks, John you want to take that?
John Doyle: Mark mentioned in his prepared comments, we’ve had a good run in the U.S. results. They have been consistently at the high end of our revenue range. You know I mentioned earlier, MMA had good strong growth, on both P&C and EHB [ph] so I was quite pleased with that. I mentioned the pricing dynamic, you know a very, very modest price increases in the MMA portfolio, so not a big driver of the outcome, but it helps a bit.Marsh U.S. also has very, very strong new business after you know really an outstanding new business quarter in the second quarter of 2018, so I was quite pleased there.Our MGA operation in U.S. Victor had a nice quarter, and our captive management business also had a strong quarter in the United States. So overall I was quite pleased with the results in the U.S.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies for any closing remarks.
Dan Glaser: Thank you, operator and thanks to everybody for joining us on the call this morning. I wanted to express my gratitude to our 76,000 colleagues for the commitment and hard work that they’ve shown, as well as to our clients for their support.We had two core priorities in the second quarter; first to provide world class service to our clients and second, to begin the successful integration of JLT and I’m delighted with the progress that we’ve made on both fronts.I’ve seen firsthand how hard our colleagues have been working and the dedication they’ve shown to our company. We are building something special here and it is the trust and confidence of all of our clients that makes that possible.Thank you all very much and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter.
Operator: That will conclude today’s call. Thank you for your patience. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-25 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. First quarter 2019 financial results, supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the Company’s website at www.mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially for those contemplated by such statements. For a more details discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of that measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today’s earnings. I’ll now turn over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Please go ahead.
Dan Glaser: Thank you, Glena. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I’m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses. John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also, with us this morning is, Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. Our first quarter represents a great start to the year. Before I get into the results, I would like to say how delighted we are to have completed the JLT acquisition earlier this month. There is tremendous energy and optimism around the benefits this combination brings to clients, colleagues and shareholders. We welcomed over 10,000 talented colleagues into the organization, providing us with more capabilities to serve clients. And this is the real power in this combination. The need for specialist advice has never been greater as clients deal with the increasing size, complexity and range of business challenges. Simply put, we are stronger together. We are the leading global professional services firm in the areas of risk, strategy and people. On a combined basis, we place over $100 billion of P&C insurance and reinsurance premiums globally. Our reach extends to more than 130 countries. We are number one in insurance brokerage, including specialty lines, the number one health and benefits broker. We are neck and neck in reinsurance. We are number one HR consulting firm. And we have leading specialist industry capabilities in management consulting. Size and scale are increasingly important but size isn’t everything. Quality and capability are what really matter to clients and on that score, we are second to none. Creating what is Marsh & McLennan today was no small undertaking. It took decades of steady execution and courageous decisions. I am deeply grateful to the prior leaders of Marsh & McLennan for their significant contributions to our current success. We will continue to build and improve the reach and capabilities of MMC. With regard to JLT, we worked tirelessly to obtain all regulatory and shareholder approvals so that we could close the deal on April 1. At the beginning of March, we announced the agreement to divest JLT’s aerospace business. And during the first quarter, we secured $6.5 billion in debt financing at favorable rates, including our first ever euro bond issuance. With the benefit of the in-house expertise of Oliver Wyman, we moved quickly to establish transition teams to plan the integration. We made several leadership announcements across the organization and named JLT executives to nearly all of our executive committees. We selected leaders without regards which organization they came from. JLT brings us an influx of talent with complementary capabilities giving us more depth in almost every part of the organization. We are co-locating our colleagues to enhance opportunities for collaboration. We are working hard to keep our organization focused and are encouraged by the strong finish to 2018 at both JLT and Marsh & McLennan and our strong start to 2019. Growth requires hard work and execution. And I have every confidence we will be stronger and better position than either firm was before. To be clear, we are not promising perfection. There will be bumps and we could see an impact on growth during the integration process. That’s fine. We will sort it out and press forward as we work to build something special. In addition to JLT, we will continue to execute our broader growth strategies. We will not let up on innovating, pressing it to new growth areas and investing. For example, we continue to expand in middle market commercial insurance through Marsh & McLennan Agency. When we first announced the JLT acquisition, we committed to continue to provide MMA financial possibility to pursue further acquisitions. We have stayed true to this plan. Since the start of the year, MMA acquired Bouchard Insurance and Lovitt & Touche, both top 100 U.S. insurance brokers. The combination of strong organic growth and having high-quality agencies through acquisitions has resulted in MMA’s annualized revenues exceeding $1.5 billion, and we still see significant runway. There is meaningful growth potential in the small commercial segment across our businesses, where we are focused on digital initiatives. We see opportunities to help simplify the client experience and add value at every turn in this large and fragmented market. Major challenges facing society also present opportunities to grow and help our clients. In many markets, actual losses from cyber, flood and other natural perils far exceed insurance coverage. Filling this gap is a growth opportunity for us that also serves a greater good. Retirement security is a major challenge for society as much of the world is falling short of what today’s aging population will need. Mercer is a leader in this space where actuarial investment in FinTech specialties meet. In Health, the need for advice in the face of healthcare complexities is significant and we are well positioned given the strength of our capabilities across Marsh, Mercer and Oliver Wyman. Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance pricing trend. Overall pricing is modestly higher. The Marsh global insurance market index, so an increase of 3% in the first quarter, up from 2% in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 1% in the first quarter of 2018. Global property lines continue to see price increases. Casualty price declines have slowed while professional lines pricing increased approximately 6% in the quarter. Turning to reinsurance. Guy Carpenter’s Global Property Catastrophe Rate on Line index increased 1% for the January 1, 2019, renewals. More recently, the pricing data coming out of the April 1 renewals, which are primarily focused on Japan, were up for loss impacted programs. We are starting to see upward rate pressure in the market in certain pockets and geographies although capital remains abundant. Now let me turn to our first quarter financial performance. Marsh & McLennan had a strong start to the year. We generated consolidated underlying revenue growth across both Risk & Insurance Services and Consulting. Consolidated revenue was $4.1 billion, up 2% or 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 11% to $1 billion and the adjusted operating margin expanded 210 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share grew 10% to $1.52. In Risk & Insurance Services, first quarter revenue was $2.4 billion, an increase of 3%. Underlying revenue growth was 5% in the quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of underlying growth of 5% or more in RIS. Marsh had another strong quarter with underlying growth of 5%. Guy Carpenter’s underlying growth was impressive at 6%, given the tough comparable of 7% growth in first quarter 2018. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $775 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points versus a year ago. In Consulting, first quarter revenue was $1.7 billion, in line with the year-ago. Underlying revenue was up 2% for the quarter driven by strong underlying growth at Oliver Wyman of 7%, partially offset by Mercer which was flat. Nevertheless, we had strong growth in Consulting adjusted operating income of 18%, and saw a 270 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. Martine took over as CEO of Mercer March 1. While Mercer is underlying growth was soft in the quarter, Martine has a firm grasp on the business, and we are confident in Mercer’s long-term growth outlook. Based on the slow start, full your underlying revenue growth in Mercer could be muted. However, full year earnings growth will benefit from Mercer’s recent restructuring initiatives. In summary, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. For 2019, we expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion and solid growth in adjusted EPS, although with respect to underlying revenue, we are mindful of potential impact from the integration of JLT. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, Dan. Good morning. Our first quarter represented a strong start to the year. Overall revenue was up 2%, 4% on an underlying basis. Operating income in the quarter increased 3%, while adjusted operating income was up 11% to a record $1 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points to 26.2% and included strong margin expansion in both RIS and Consulting. GAAP EPS rose 4% to $1.40 and adjusted EPS increased 10% to $1.52. Looking at Risk & Insurance Services, first quarter revenue was $2.4 billion, up 3% compared with the year ago and 5% on an underlying basis. This is a continuation of the strong growth we generated in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $775 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 33.6%. And Marsh revenue in the quarter was $1.7 billion, with underlying growth of 5%. Growth in the quarter was broad-based and helped by strong new business. The U.S. and Canada division continued its trend of strong growth with 5% underlying revenue growth. In International, underlying growth was also 5%, with EMEA up 3%, Asia Pacific up 8% and Latin America up 11%. Guy Carpenter’s revenue was $663 million, up 6% on an underlying basis driven by strong growth in the U.S., Asia Pacific and Latin America. Guy Carpenter’s strong first quarter performance builds on the outstanding results delivered in 2018. In the Consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was $1.7 billion, which is flat versus a year ago and up 2% on an underlying basis, reflecting strong growth at Oliver Wyman offset by softness at Mercer. Adjusted operating income grew 18% to $291 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 270 basis points to 18%. Mercer’s revenue in the quarter was $1.2 billion, with flat underlying revenue growth due in part to a tough year-over-year comparison to the 5% underlying growth we reported in the first quarter of last year. Results this quarter reflected growth in health and career offset by a decline in wealth. Wealth underlying revenue fell 3% in the quarter, reflecting a mid-single digit decline in defined benefits, partially offset by continued growth in investment management. Our assets under delegated management continue to grow and were approximately $265 billion at the end of the quarter. In early 2017, we established the wealth business by bringing together our retirement and investments businesses. This changed the line more closely with how we serve clients and was designed to simplify the organization and reduce layers. At this point, given the evolution of these businesses, we will now report wealth is one combined business. Health underlying revenue increased 3% in the quarter despite a tough comparison of 7% growth in the first quarter of last year and Career grew 2%. Mercer incurred $11 million of charges in the quarter related to its ongoing restructuring program, which we expect to be completed by the end of the second quarter. The benefits of the program contributed to the strong earnings growth and margin expansion in Consulting. As Dan mentioned, we expect this program will benefit full year earnings in Consulting, although we will see moderation in margin expansion from the level in the first quarter as we move through the balance of the year. Oliver Wyman had a great start to the year, with first quarter revenue of $518 million representing growth of 7% on an underlying basis. Results were strong across most of the portfolio. As you know, we closed our acquisition of JLT on April 1. Due to strict rules regarding sharing of competitively sensitive information prior to closing, we are in the process of reviewing the details of JLT’s 2019 budget, converting their results to U.S. GAAP by quarter and developing a firmer perspective on some of our modeling assumptions. As a result, we expect to update the elements of our previous guidance on our next call. We continue to expect the JLT acquisition to be modestly dilutive to adjusted GAAP EPS in year one, breakeven in year two, and accretive in year three. In order to help the investment community better assess the combined business, before our next earnings call, we plan to provide JLT’s 2018 results by quarter under U.S. GAAP. In addition, we will file the SEC required pro forma disclosures showing 2018 pro forma earnings for the combined company. As contemplated in our financing plans, we raised a total of $6.5 billion of senior notes across eight tranches of debt at various maturities. In addition to $5.25 billion of U.S. debt, we also completed our first euro bond offering in March, raising an additional €1.1 billion. We began incurring interest expense and generating interest income on proceeds from this debt as of January 15. In our GAAP income statement includes $47 million of interest expense and $25 million of interest income as a result. As we indicated on our last call, both of these items were excluded from adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Following the close of the transaction, we now expect second quarter interest expense will be about $114 million (17:11). We also incurred $7 million of interest expense in the quarter, representing the amortization of fees related to our bridge facility. This $7 million is included in interest expense and our GAAP income statement. In the first quarter, we recorded a net gain of $29 million relating to the hedge instruments we put in place as part of the transaction. All of these costs associated with the JLT acquisition have been treated as noteworthy item. With the transaction now completed, our hedge position and our bridge facility have been settled and closed. Turning to investment income, on a GAAP basis, investment income was $5 million or $1 million on an adjusted basis in the quarter. For 2019, we continue to expect only modest investment income on an adjusted basis. Foreign exchange was $0.03 per share headwind to EPS in the quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be $0.01 to $0.02 headwind to adjusted EPS in each of the second and third quarters. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was 22.6% compared to 23.5% in the first quarter last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discrete item, the largest of which was the accounting for share-based compensation similar to a year ago. We expect that most of the tax benefit from equity awards will be recognized in the first quarter of each year, which is when most of our equity awards bet. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 26%. Based on the current environment, it’s reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2019, excluding discrete items in any impact from JLT. In the first quarter, we implemented the new lease accounting standard. This result in a minimal impact operating income, but did result in an increase in liabilities on our balance sheet of $1.9 billion, which is largely offset by a corresponding increase in assets. In the first quarter, we did not repurchase any stock in line with our guidance that we would not repurchase stock ahead of the close of the JLT acquisition. However, we continue to anticipate repurchasing enough stock in 2019 to satisfy our commitment to reduce our share count each year. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $13 billion or $12.3 billion, excluding commercial paper. This compares with $5.8 billion at the end of 2018. Total debt includes the $6.5 billion of debt issued in the first quarter to fund the acquisition of JLT. At closing, JLT had $1 billion of debt outstanding, $450 million of which was repaid shortly after closing, leaving $550 million of JLT debt that is still outstanding. We will likely refinance this debt over the course of the next several months. Post closing, our total debt, excluding commercial paper stood at $12.8 billion. Our next debt maturity is in September 2019 with 300 million of senior notes will mature. At this point, our expectation is that we will retire the September notes with cash on hand in line with our plan deleveraging over the next couple of years. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was 1.1 billion. Note that the cash proceeds from our debt issuance in the quarter were held in escrow as reflected on our balance sheet as opposed to on the cash line. Uses of cash in the first quarter included $210 million for dividend and $288 million for acquisition. While deleveraging will be a priority over the next couple of years, we provided for the flexibility to continue to pursue selective acquisition and MMA will be the primary focus given the significant success of this strategy over the last decade. For the full year 2019, we continue to expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividends per share by double digits. As noted on our last call, starting this quarter, we have changed our calculation of adjusted operating margins to exclude transaction amortization, so investors can get a better sense of core margin performance following the JLT acquisitions. This change had no meaningful impact on the increase in margin in Q1 compared with a year ago. Our press release includes supplemental information that recast our margins in 2017 and 2018 by quarter to exclude transaction amortization. Overall, we’re pleased with our strong start to the year. And with that, I’m happy to turn it back to Dan.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Mark. Glena, we’re ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, good morning. My first question, Dan, a couple of times in your remarks you alluded to the fact that there could be an impact on growth during the integration of JLT. I mean, I know you guys are only a month into the deal. But could you just expand some comments on that? What part of your businesses you expect – you could see some headwinds? And then kind of as a supplement to that question, are you guys going to include JLT within the acquired revenue line or is it going to be part of organic revenue starting in the second quarter?
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Elyse. And okay, so MMC’s underlying growth has been in a range of 3% to 5% for the past decade. And I certainly anticipate that sort of range or better over time. So I’m not – any comment I’d make is really in the near-term as opposed to thinking about mid-term or long-term. And the reality is we expect some near-term choppiness as we go through the integration process. I mean, some revenue loss, this synergy was modeled in our base case, not that we’re not going to fight every fight, but we are realistic about what big integrations mean in people businesses and so let’s see how this will play out. There will be some short-term noise, but that’s all it is. It’s noise. The combination of Marsh & McLennan and JLT will prove to be spectacular. The greatest collection of talent and capabilities in our space, improved geographic positioning, higher capacity to invest in the future, things like data and analytics and digital. And our data and analytics flywheel, that I’ve talked about before. I mean, the combination will give us more clients. More clients will create more data. More data will allow us to use analytics to create additional insight and gain more clients. And so in that way, it’s self-perpetuating, so very positive overall. In terms of your follow-up, Mark, it’s – why don’t you handle that? So we see on smaller acquisitions, our convention has been to exclude them from underlying growth for the first year after a deal. But we won’t do that in this case. So we will – when we report underlying growth going forward, it will be combined MMC and JLT.
Mark McGivney: Yes, we want to get to, just so we’re clear. We don’t want to be sitting here internally months from now talking about, well, how did Marsh & McLennan do in Asia in the month of July and then how did JLT do. There is no JLT. There is no Marsh & McLennan. There is the combined organization and we are one. So we want to look at the new organization and the results on a combined basis.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, great. And I agree that will be more helpful to analyze. My second question on the margin side, I wasn’t sure if there was anything one-off within Consulting, your other operating expenses declined significantly in the quarter relative to what we’ve seen in the past. I wasn’t sure, if there was something that was driving that or if it’s just less investments and – like you said in some of your prepared remarks you’re repaying on some of the benefits from the restructuring actions there?
Dan Glaser: That’s exactly right. I mean as we’ve said before, I wouldn’t look at any one quarter as indicative in terms of the margin trajectory. And I would also reiterate that for us, margin expansion is an outcome of the way we run the business, almost always revenue growth exceeds expense growth and we’re more focused on top line revenue and earnings growth than we are on margin expansion, but we expect continued margin expansion, because of the way we run the business. And 2019, in our view, will be our 12th straight year of margin expansion.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Michael Phillips: Hi, good morning. Thanks everybody. Just I want to dive in deeper a little bit more on the Oliver Wyman, nice momentum in Oliver Wyman in the quarter. It’s kind of continued in the last couple of quarters. And so maybe you can kind of the talk about where you’re seeing that and the expectations going forward?
Dan Glaser: Sure, sure. And as we’ve said before Oliver Wyman over long stretches of time, will probably be our highest growth operating company but with more volatility because of the nature of the business and the lack of recurring revenue, but Scott you want to add to the comments?
Scott McDonald: Sure, Mike. Despite I think what are pretty regular warnings of doom and gloom from economists in the press these days. We see little evidence across almost all sectors and regions. But there is a slowdown in the initiatives, businesses are pursuing, most of the businesses we work with are still focused heavily on growth or transformation or technology. And Dan has talked about I think many times on this call just how complex the world is becoming. It’s more global, more political, more technology change, more challenges with data and analytics, more challenges around the workforce and all this bodes pretty well for high-end strategy consulting. So our predictions have remained the same. We continue to target mid to high-single digit revenue growth over time. I think you will have seen over the last few years, our revenue can be pretty volatile, but over any long period. That’s what we think we can achieve.
Dan Glaser: Anything else, Mike?
Michael Phillips: No, thank you very much. I appreciate that, that’s good.
Dan Glaser: Okay. Thank you. Ryan?
Operator: The next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Ryan Tunis: Hey thanks, good morning, guys. First question, just sort of a $0.03 per share headwind from FX. On a year-over-year basis, what was the impact had on the margin?
Dan Glaser: So Mark, you want to take that?
Mark McGivney: Ryan, it was a modest benefit to margins, but not anything terribly significant. The biggest driver of margin expansion was operating performance in the quarter.
Ryan Tunis: Okay. And then I actually wanted to ask about the whole Medicare for all theme. And I’m curious in markets where the impact that that might have on the Healthcare Consulting business. So maybe you could just give us some perspective in countries where there are single-payer systems, Canada, UK. I guess are you able to have a presence in the Healthcare Consulting, when you have that type of system?
Dan Glaser: I’ll take that question broadly and then I’ll hand over to Martine to talk a little bit about what we see in markets like Canada and the UK, et cetera. But I’ll just start by saying, Health is a great business for us. In fact, it’s our largest line of business. We’ve got almost $2.5 billion of revenue and almost half of that is in the United States. And clearly, Medicare for all is a hot topic. But what that means and what form that could conceivably take really depends on who is talking about it. And for consultants and trusted advisers, uncertainty generally creates opportunities as we – as clients seek advice. And so we don’t see this in the short-term is any significant headwind or a negative. I mean just to level set for a second, over 180 million Americans receive healthcare benefits through employer-sponsored plans. And generally speaking, those plans are highly subsidized by employers. So more than of the half of the U.S. population is being served by their employers in that way and significant changes if any. And I would stress if any, would be unlikely until 2021, 2022 and that’s really unclear whether there would be any kind of significant change. But in the mean time, we’re certainly going to work diligently to improve availability and affordability to our clients. And for us, I would stress that it’s a global business. And we’re successful globally. So Martine, you want to add something to that?
Martine Ferland: Yes, certainly. Thank you. And first let me say, I’m excited to taking the helm, and I’m delighted to be here for the first time with you all. So from a Health perspective and you were referring to UK and U.S. in your question, actually I’m very familiar with those being Canadian and having lived in the UK last 8 years. We have striving health businesses in these two countries and in many countries around the world. Even with universal systems, what we see is there is a need for employer-provided plans where there is supplementary plans, supplementary cover that is being provided. We’re also very active in providing wellness advice, health advise and helping employers manage the cost curve in every country and also helping individuals manage the healthcare system. These are just very often complex system. People in need them at the moment that matters for them, really need help. So as the health becomes more consumerized, we see also opportunities for us to help employees, retirees, individuals manage cost and access the best care they can at the best price.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Martine. Next question, please?
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Mike Zaremski: Hey, good morning. First question is from regarding the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, they published their final report this past February, but the wholesale insurance marketplace. I’m curious if the closure of that study changes Marsh’s game plans at all or maybe the study had changed the game plan prior? Maybe perhaps speed up moving into more of those types of facilities and any color there would be great?
Dan Glaser: Sure. I mean, overall, we were pleased with the outcome only really as a result of any time that there is a level of uncertainty, because a big review is taking place. We’re watching it closely. Our view was, it was largely business as usual. Market functioning it’s very competitive. There is new capital formation. There is great client outcomes. But I’ll hand over to John to talk about if it influences Marsh’s strategy at all. John?
John Doyle: Thanks, Dan. No, I don’t see it changing our strategy going forward at all. We have governance in place and guidelines and philosophies statements around how we get paid, how much we get paid and what that fee income is related to? As Dan said, we were pleased with the outcome. Facilities that we use to place business into in the London market makeup a small, really fraction of our overall placement strategy around the world. Although, we do think, and it’s a way for us to drive value to our clients ultimately. And as we come together with JLT, we’re learning a little bit more about their approach to it, philosophy to it as well. So we see an opportunity for greater use of facilities, but it won’t be a dominant part of our placement strategy.
Dan Glaser: Anything else Mike?
Mike Zaremski: Yes. One-off last follow-up, Dan to your comments about P&C pricing moving a little bit north. You mentioned abundant capital, curious if you guys have any theories on what’s causing the move up in rates? I guess the million dollar question for all of investors is it – is where the rates are just moving up as a result of the increase in loss inflation or is something else going on in terms of the competitive dynamics?
Dan Glaser: Pricing is always a lagging indicator and it is geared toward losses. Ultimately, it’s really a supply and demand market, the higher the losses that underwriters suffer, the more that they actually underwrite, reduce their exposures and that creates some level of supply crunch, which raises rating levels and pricing. And so we’re not in a soft market and we’re not in a hard market. We’re sort of in the shoulder market, but I’ll hand off to the experts both John and Peter to add a little bit more color to the pricing commentary. So John, what you see on the primary side?
John Doyle: Okay. So as Dan noted earlier, prices going to average is up 3% in the quarter versus 2% in the fourth quarter. In most regions around the world, prices were up 1% to 2%. So as Dan just said it’s not what I would define as a hard market by any stretch. Australia is probably the one exception where prices are up on average in the low-double digit range across various lines of business. Financial lines pricing was up about 6% in the first quarter, just shy of 6%, probably P&L pricing really driving that. And to your question about, why there has been an increase in frequency and severity around securities clients, right. That’s persisted over the last several years. I mean, so underwriters are obviously responding to that and trying to push price. Property pricing largely driven by cat exposed risks and we all know about the cat loss environment for the last couple of years, up about 5% in the quarter. Casualty remains pretty risk, pretty mixed – excuse me, as you know as longer-tail. Work comp pricing remains down about 5% on average in the U.S. General liability down about 2%, but excess liability pricing is moving up a bit, that was up 3% in the quarter. Auto pricing up 5% in the quarter. What I would say is that the market is more challenging for buyers than it’s been in sometime. It’s definitely different than it was three months ago and six months ago. Again, having said that, the average isn’t moving all that much. As Dan said, capital remains abundant and while capacity remains stable, the risk appetite for some underwriters is changing. So, at times we’re seeing lower limits being offered, higher attachment points. In some cases, underwriters are exiting certain classes of business. Now, again, on average we’re getting things done for our clients in the right way. And I don’t see a broad based hard market in front of us. Over time, some risk classes will get mixed price for various reasons. And so I think we’ll see some micro cycles where correction will happen over a short period of time.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, John. So turning to the reinsurance side for some commentary on that, Peter, you want to tell us what’s happening on the reinsurance market?
Peter Hearn: Sure, Dan. Mike, a lot of the comments that John said pertain to reinsurance as well. I mean, you had $200 billion of losses in 2017 and 2018. And they continue to grow. I think that many of those losses were quantitatively different from those as investors expected. And they included deterioration in the 2017 loss and the loss creep we’ve seen from urban in particular. Losses for un-modeled or under-modeled peril such as wildfire and then losses from human causes such as the assignment of benefits issue that we’ve seen in Florida. So to John’s point, the market has been orderly at 1.1 and 4.1. Yes, we’ve seen increases with loss impacted business, whether it would be Japanese wind. We’re now starting to see the assets of the Florida renewals, where there has been loss impacted layers, there has been rate increase. But I would say overall the market is transitioning. It’s not a hard market. By definition, most people use for hard, but it is certainly transitioning on those lines of business where there have been losses.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Peter. Next question, please?
Operator: Next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead.
Meyer Shields: Great, thank you. I had two quick questions for Martine. First, obviously the restructuring plan going on and Dan mentioned, the potential for distraction associated with the JLT merger. Is the restructuring itself responsible for some of the weakness in Mercer in the first quarter?
Dan Glaser: Yes. So let me talk about that a little bit and then I’ll hand over to Martine. I mean I think in general and as you’ve seen in the past throughout our company, there are periodic periods where we believe as a very large global organization. We have to look at our structure. We have to approach it in a way that always been looking to simplify delayer, focus more on the client, because large companies by their very nature, grow infrastructure and other accouterments. So that in my view was more of a normal course type of restructuring effort and whether that has an impact on short-term growth is unlikely. I think the reality is Mercer grew 5% in the first quarter of last year. They had some tough comps and that’s probably at the heart of it. I made the muted comments in my script, because frankly, Martine just got the job. And the last thing I want is for her and her key team to be focused on the next few quarters and delivering some – what I want them to do is, look at the business, drains out like any new executive team, come up with plans on how to drive sustainable profitable growth over multiple years and that’s really the task at hand. And in terms of that JLT, I wouldn’t call it a distraction in any way in terms of integration, whether that’s about RIS or Mercer. But I think it’s more of a recognition that there some areas of the business that might have some revenue breakage and the employee benefit side is probably not one of them. But Martine, do you have anything to add? I think you give much room.
Martine Ferland: Thanks for the question. Well, as Dan just said, I think the elm about two months ago, very excited about it. I think Mercer has unmatched global platform and capabilities. The areas in which we play Health, Wealth, Career, really they address topical issues for society, for enterprises, clients, individuals. Our expertise is very strong, recognized. Our brand is strong and we are leaders in all the countries where we operate. What we offer is needed and value for our client. So I do see growth. And many of our business areas are growing well. As Dan and Mark said, we had tough comparables in some places, Health in particular, some are delegated solution and really strong market a quarter – a year ago. We had strong – we had good market movement this quarter, but lesser than a quarter ago. Really it’s – as you all know, the actuarial defined benefit business within Wealth is one area that has a structural decline. And that said, I believe we can perform better in this area than we have done recently and I come from this business. I have previous experience in it and we’re in the process of implementing changes there in terms of roles, incentives, technology. That will enhance retention and also we invigorate ourselves on the market. And as you know, we are very strong on the delegated solution side. It is absolutely interlinked with our pension business. We have closed $265 billion of assets under management at the end of the quarter by far the leading market leader in that space.
Meyer Shields: Thanks.
Dan Glaser: So Meyer, I think – any follow-up, I’ll count your restructuring in JLT distractions. It was stated together that as one query. Do you have anything else?
Meyer Shields: Just a quick one. In terms of whether there is any useful rule of thumb relating the Mercer restructuring expenses and the anticipated annualized savings?
Dan Glaser: No, I mean, ultimately, a lot of the savings will drop to the bottom line. But we’re always looking to invest in the business and we’ll continue to do that. And so – and there is no rule of thumb associated with that. Next question, please?
Operator: The next question comes from Larry Greenberg from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.
Larry Greenberg: Good morning and thank you. Mike, my questions were really answered. But I guess, maybe I’ll just dig or throw one more out on JLT. I mean, Dan, it seems to me that other large acquisitions in this space. This synergy’s tend to come from people leaving deciding for whatever reason that, they don’t want to continue to be part of the big team and choose to do something else. Is that mostly what we’re talking about here?
Dan Glaser: To me, that is a part of it, but a small part of it. I mean we are getting over 10,000 talented colleagues. Yes, sure, we’ll lose some, who decided they’d rather work in a different environment. But in my view, we were the employer of choice in our industry and our leadership team. Part of their principal job is to create a culture and environment that attracts and retains the top talented people in our space. And so, I have no doubt that we have a collection of individuals that will form teams that are very solid in the marketplace and really on a top talent basis. I think, when I look over any kind of stretch of time, I imagine, when you think about a mid to long-term time horizon, anything we’re talking about potential revenue breakage will largely be meaningless in the overall scheme of things. But it could create a headwind in the short term. I’ll just give you a couple of easy examples. You might have a retail client within Marsh and JLT, where the clients themselves always had two brokers and they want two brokers, okay. Some clients choose to do that. Other clients want [indiscernible] (46:03) strength of a very strategic organization to organization relationship. But if you add a client that wants two brokers. And one of those brokers is JLT and one of those brokers is Marsh right now. Well, then there’s going to be some activity there or you might have some wholesale business where U.S. third-party broker that used JLT in London, because they didn’t view JLT as a competitor in the U.S. All of a sudden, they view Marsh as a competitor in the U.S. And so maybe they’ll have some challenge about whether, okay, how are you guys going into one the business to where you can still service our needs. And we’re going to do the best we can, best endeavors to try to do that and keep things separate and run businesses in a way that we always put our clients’ interests first even when that client might actually be a competitor in some other part of our organization. But what we are really, like I said, ultimately, I think that this will be a meaningless number when we look over the course of a few years. Ultimately, clients choose best talent. The best talent and capabilities will win, not about any what badges or name is on the building.
Larry Greenberg: Thanks. That’s helpful.
Operator: The next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs.
Yaron Kinar: Hi, good morning. I know, you guys have shied away from giving any targets around cost saves and the like, but just given the meaningful impact that we’re seeing here in Consulting on the margin front. Is there anything you could say about the cost saves from the current restructuring?
Dan Glaser: I mean, the overall restructuring is in that $70 million to maybe $80 million level. Most of its already been done. So what you’re seeing is some roll forward on that it would be natural have more savings early after restructuring than later because the level of investments are not having – not necessarily occurring simultaneously with the restructuring. But ultimately, this was not a large restructuring in the overall scheme of things. There will be savings, which dropped to the bottom-line as we’ve always done that, we’ve been very disciplined about that. What I would overall focus on is the fact that our margin has expanded dramatically over many years. I mean, the company’s margin is up something like 700 bps in the last five years. And so, we have continual margin expansion as we run the business properly. And we see margin expansion in 2019 as we said in the script.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you. That’s helpful. And then if I switch over to RIS, I think, MMA now accounts for about a third of your U.S. revenues in Marsh. I’m guessing that’s going to get diluted a little bit through JLT, but is there a number or a portion of the business that you would like it to be or that you would not wanted to cross?
Dan Glaser: It is a couple of things. One JLT is quite, quite modest in the U.S., so it won’t have a real overall impact on the various percentages. And no, we want MMA to continue to grow. We think that there’s – it’s still a very fragmented space. The largest part of the market when you look at the vast middle market, however you define it – it’s a terrific sweet spot for the company. We’ve built what we believe is the finest national platform in the middle market and we will continue to look at that. There is no end in sight and we certainly wouldn’t create a constraint on MMA in order to create some percentage between large accounts and national brokerage and MMA. It’s like we will go wherever the market will bear. And it’s not just in the United States, I mean, Marsh, John and his team and Peter before that have done a very good job of maintaining our position and growing our position in the large accounts space, while growing faster in the vast middle market in many countries around the world. And so Marsh is becoming much more like a pyramid as opposed to top-heavy with regard to just in risk management.
Operator: The next question comes from Paul Newsome from Sandler O’Neill. Please go ahead.
Paul Newsome: I wanted to touch base a little bit more on the potential [indiscernible] (51:09) with JLT. Is it fair to say that the places that you’re most likely see some organic growth slow are the places with the most combined market share? And if maybe you could – if that’s the case maybe to sort of give some thoughts on where we might see it or not see it if it all things go well?
Dan Glaser: Yes, I think you guys are all sort of overstating it as an issue. As I just said, over the course of any kind of mid-term basis, we’re looking at something, which would be a meaningless type of number. And we modeled it within our deal costs anyway. I mean, I think the obvious thing would be if you look at RIS, that’s where most of JLT exist, that’s where most of the integration takes place. But, we’re not looking at big numbers. And by the way, we did model any revenue synergy into this deal. And we’ve expressed before the notion that we absolutely expect some revenue synergy as JLT clients, existing JLT clients have access to things like Oliver Wyman, Mercer Investment, Mercer Career, some of the digital capabilities and data and analytic capabilities within Marsh. But we’re a conservative company the deal model, stood on its own. And so therefore, we didn’t model that, but we’ve been surprised positively about many of the things we have seen within JLT. And I start with the idea that the quality of the people is very high. And our view about how we go forward is we’re a people business and the greatest degree of high quality, talented, creative, diligent, hardworking people working as a team creates more value for our clients and ultimately for our colleagues in career path and our shareholders as well. There is a few things that we’ve been happy about that we did not expect. As an example, Mercer has extensive operations in India, which support their business. This is much less so in Marsh and Guy Carpenter, but interestingly, JLT actually has a pretty high degree of integration in their operating model in India. And that gives us mid-term possibilities for Marsh and Guy Carpenter that would be easier to capture than if we just did this on our own in. Other things that we’ve seen, while obviously compensation is always different in organizations and then people business is vitally important. The methodology in how we look at compensation and the team-based way of how we look at client service and profitability is very similar between the two organizations. And that contrasts with certain other organizations that put the individual producer and individual production at the top of the compensation model. In our company, that’s different, and I’m happy to say the JLT was as well. So I would just say, there’s tremendous optimism and energy within Marsh & McLennan right now to welcome our JLT colleagues. And we will deliver not we – as I said, we’re not promising perfection. These are big companies coming together, but any noise will be short-term. And we certainly expect over time that 3% to 5% growth or higher will be delivered. We just wanted to be upfront and say, but don’t forget, and that’s what we’re doing right now. So next question, please?
Paul Newsome: That makes sense. Obviously, you have a great track record with making acquisitions. It also similarly, as you go through the process. Are there any pieces that might end up being divested or slowdown or they also affect the revenue as we look forward with go buy company?
Dan Glaser: I mean, when we – I wouldn’t say, like I said, there is no JLT anymore. What there is a combined organization that is coming together and forming a new organization. We are the – we’re the largest start up in the world. And so, when I look at it, we always look at parts of our business. Our entire business, in a way of saying, where the low growth, low-margin business is. And we always create challenge as to whether those businesses are required or not? And we would do that across our entire organization, the broader organization, which is both Marsh & McLennan and legacy JLT. Put them all together, and we create quadrants, as you know, high-growth, high-margin; high growth, low-margin; low margin, low growth and et cetera. And so ultimately, that’s a continual process and you’ve seen us over the years. Every once in a while, divest in asset almost in all ways, it’s in that low growth or low margin category and you’ll see us continue to do that as we go forward.
Operator: The next question comes from Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Jay Cohen: Yes, maybe questions for Mark, some modeling questions. Mark, you’ve given us the interest expense for the 2Q. Can you talk about the corresponding investment income from the proceeds that you should expect to see?
Mark McGivney: And Jay, as I said, we had $25 million of interest income on the cash that was sitting around in escrow. But at this point, it’s all been deployed. And so going forward, I’d expect minimal amount of interest income, sort of what we’ve seen in the past and whatever corporate cash flow.
Jay Cohen: Go it. That makes sense. Quarterly amortization expense post deal, can you give us a sense of that?
Mark McGivney: As I said in my script, Jay, that along with a number of other elements of our model, we’re really in the process of updating our perspective on. So, at the last guidance we’ve given is $180 million on a post-tax basis. And for now, that’s where the number stands. But as we – between now and the second quarter that you’ll see some pro forma information come out as required. On June 11, we’ll be required to file a pro forma that will have after JLT for 2018 with pro forma adjustments. Purchase accounting will be one of them. So, you’ll get a little bit more information when that’s filed. And then on our next call, I’d expect to update those elements of guidance that we’ve given in the past.
Operator: The next question comes from David Styblo from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Styblo: Hi, there. Good morning, thanks for the questions and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to just come back to JLT for a second and I appreciate the prudently cautious comments about just bumps and being forward about that. I guess, I’m more curious about how the customer experience is and engagement has been about opportunities? You’ve touched on a couple of them to start to go down that path. But I would like to hear more about what the customer response has been and some of the opportunities that you guys would have to cross-sell and provide more services as a deeper share of wallet within the customer base?
Dan Glaser: Sure. I mean, it’s a great question and actually, the initial client response, since the deal announcement has been incredibly positive and RIMS is coming up. So, why don’t I ask John to go into that a little bit more detail? So, what do you seeing John, what are you hearing?
John Doyle: Sure. Initial feedback has been quite positive. I have spoken myself to a couple of dozen clients in the last couple of weeks, including a few yesterday and the feedback has been quite positive. Many of these relationships, of course, overlap. So, wasn’t a first time introduction for me with a number of clients that I engaged with. Obviously, we were competitors just three weeks ago, right. So, we’re still just starting out how the value proposition will change, but there are real opportunities for cross-sell, right. JLT in a lot of ways, although a big company operated like a specialty boutique and we had a kind of a broader view of the client relationship. And so those relationships are often fitting together quite nicely. And as Dan pointed out earlier, I want to make sure their teams will be in place, right. The people have they’ve hired in the past will continue to serve them. So, I was in London on day one and for the first week and Lucy Clarke, who comes from JLT and now leads Marsh’s Specialty Operations, Marsh JLT Specialty. She and I worked together most of the week. We are also really quite encouraged literally on the first day. We had teams in the market together, working on accounts. There is nothing more than those kind of experience to accelerate kind of the socialization that needs to happen between the two teams. And as Dan said, RIMS starts on Sunday. And so the masses will descend upon Boston. We will bring a bit of an army ourselves. It’s a great opportunity for us to spend some time with our colleagues, new colleagues from JLT. But we have 1,500 client meetings scheduled from Monday through the end of day, Wednesday. And it’s a great opportunity for us to get feedback, and so we’ve got some systematic ways of doing that, and then, of course, more informal feedback. But at the end of next week, we’ll have a much more data on it but we’re off to a good start.
David Styblo: Great. Thanks. And then real quick, I knew these are smaller businesses within Marsh geographically, but Latin America, Asia Pacific, the organic growth was really quite strong. And I think, Latin America, the 11% was for some in double-digits for a couple of years. So curious to hear about anything particular, driving that broad-based products or services? So…
Dan Glaser: I mean, Latin America – I mean within Marsh, Latin America has been the highest growth region in the aggregate for the last decade. But, John, anything in particular?
John Doyle: Look, I was pleased with the start to the year for sure. I do think we’re getting a little bit of lift from pricing to be clear. But some of the leadership changes that we’ve made are taking hold in some parts of the world. So I’ve been pleased with that. As you all know, and we underway a simplification effort a year ago and moved some talent to faster growing areas. I think that’s contributing to increased growth. But I’m pleased with our – the execution of our strategy and the focus on client segmentation. New business is improving and most of the world, last three is improving. Some of the faster growing kind of specialties if you will, are transaction risks, cyber very good quarter in aviation. Our Energy business has performed well in the first quarter, as did our Credit Specialties. Our MGA business is also growing nicely as well. So, it’s pretty broad-based, good start to the year. Latin America and Asia, I do expect over time to grow faster than the rest of Marsh.
Operator: That will conclude today’s question-and-answer session. I’d now like to turn the call back to your host, Mr. Glaser, for any additional or closing remarks.
Dan Glaser: No. I’d like to thank everybody for joining the call this morning. And particularly, I’d like to welcome more than 10,000 JLT colleagues to Marsh & McLennan. I’d like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. I hope all of you have a great day. Thank you very much.
Operator: That will conclude today’s call. Thank you for your participation. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-31 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. Fourth quarter 2018 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more details discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Dan Glaser: Thank you, Elaine, and good morning everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses. John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also, with us this morning is, Dan Farrell, Head of Investor Relations. Dan has had had two successful years leading the IR team and will soon be transitioning to a new role. We’re pleased that Sarah DeWitt has recently joined us and will take over as Head of IR. On behalf of the executive committee, I want to thank Dan for his contributions. Our fourth quarter represented an outstanding finish to the year. Our overall revenue growth in the quarter was strong with 5% underlying growth and all of our business contributing. Marsh grew 6% in the quarter on an underlying basis, the strongest quarter of underlying growth since the second quarter of 2012. Guy Carpenter also finished strong posting 5% underlying revenue growth. The eighth consecutive quarter of 4% or better underlying growth. These results combine to lift our underlying growth in RIS to 6% for the quarter, the third consecutive quarter of underlying growth of 5% or more in RIS. Our Consulting segment grew 3% on an underlying basis in the quarter, due to a solid finish to the year in Oliver Wyman, an improvement in DB Consulting in Mercer. The fourth quarter as expected saw a strong adjusted operating margin expansion of 180 basis points and adjusted operating income growth of 15%, excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. For the full-year, we generated 7% overall revenue growth with 4% underlying growth. By segment, we saw underlying growth of 5% in RIS, the best full-year growth we have seen since 2012 and 3% underlying growth in consulting. We demonstrated topline strength across our businesses. Marsh delivered 4% underlying growth for the year, the best result since 2014. Guy Carpenter had a terrific year with 7% underlying growth, the strongest result since 2009. Mercer achieved 3% underlying growth, despite a 4% decline in the DBA business and Oliver Wyman grew 5% for the year overcoming headwinds from declining bank regulatory work. Our adjusted NOI grew 8% with overall margin expansion of 30 basis points for the year, marking the eleventh consecutive year we have reported margin expansion. Adjusted EPS grew 11% for the year, another year of double-digit growth that came on top of 15% growth in 2017. Since 2009, our adjusted EPS growth has averaged 13%. We balanced delivering today with positioning for tomorrow, and 2018 was a great example of strong overall execution. In addition to our strong 2018 financial performance, we made several meaningful decisions to position us for continued long-term growth. Outside of JLT, which we will discuss shortly, we deployed 1.1 billion of capital across 23 transactions representing another year of significant reinvestment in building our business through acquisitions. I’d like to highlight some of the transactions from the past year. In Mercer, we closed the acquisitions of Pavilion and Summit in the fourth quarter. These transactions add to our capabilities and scale in investments. Earlier in the year, we announced Marsh’s acquisition of Wortham combining one of the largest and best independent brokerage firms in the U.S. with our already strong position in Texas. MMA also had an active year adding seven new firms in 2018. And just last week, we announced the acquisition of Bouchard Insurance. Bouchard, based in Florida has 42 million in revenue and roughly 260 employees. As I said last quarter, we will continue to invest in Marsh & McLennan Agency, one of the finest insurance brokerage firms operating in the middle market in the U.S. In addition to continuing to execute our M&A strategy, we made meaningful progress in planting seeds in digital data and analytics. Each of our businesses continues to invest in building our capabilities. I won’t go through all the initiatives, but will highlight a few examples of our progress. In Marsh, we launched Bluestream, a digital broking platform initially focused on affinity and sharing economy businesses. Bluestream has the potential to be leveraged more broadly to seamlessly match risk and capital in the small commercial and consumer segment. It also complements other digital and small commercial strategies, including Dovetail, ICAT, Torrent, and the rebranding of our managing general underwriter as Victor. Guy Carpenter launched GC Genesis, a proprietary advisory offering on insurtech. The new service is identifying insurtech companies that will offer our clients innovative capabilities and enhance their operations and technology strategies. At Mercer, we announced this strategic alliance with Morningstar, which gives clients digital subscription access to Mercer’s proprietary investment manager research opening up a new distribution outlet for Mercer. And in Oliver Wyman, we continue to build our capabilities in digital consulting and business development through our DTA, digital technology and analytics practice, including Oliver Wyman labs. We have a deep bench of talent throughout our firm and take succession planning seriously. We recently announced that Martine Ferland will become President and CEO of Mercer as of March 1 and will join the MMC Executive Committee. Martine has a wealth of experience across Mercers businesses and is a proven global leader. Julio has done a great job at Mercer, successfully leading the business since 2012. Over that time, Mercer has nearly doubled adjusted operating income and expanded assets under delegated management by five-fold. I am pleased the company will continue to benefit from Julio’s advice and council as the Vice Chairman of MMC. In recent months, Julio and Martine have continued reshaping Mercer’s operating model and in the fourth quarter we took to restructuring actions with associated charges totaling 51 million. We simplified Mercers organization by consolidating the three geographic regions into two; U.S. Canada and International. This aligns more closely with the regional structures in place across other businesses of Marsh & McLennan. The actions resulted in structural changes in Mercer that streamline its operating model creating more efficiency and enabling better execution. Now, let’s take a moment to update you on the progress we have made on JLT. As we have said from the beginning, the is a combination of strength and strength and the primary focus is growth. Growth in talent, capabilities, revenue, and earnings. We set our approach to integration would be from the perspective of best of both and we have been true to this ideal. We have made important announcements about the leadership teams of Marsh, Mercer, and Guy Carpenter after closing. And it is important to note that we will have meaningful representation of senior JLT colleagues at the executive committee level. Our leadership team recently visited JLT’s major locations around the world, including staffs in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, many cities in the U.S. and of course London. Through townhall’s and other interactions, we have had the opportunity to engage with colleagues representing 80% of JLT’s global revenue base. The real upside for value creation is combining two successful organizations into an even more innovative and talented professional services firm. I am encouraged by our early organizational decisions in the level of engagement and commitment we are seeing throughout Marsh & McLennan and JLT. In terms of closing, we are still in the regulatory approval process. At this time, we continue to expect closing in the spring of 2019. Our strong performance in 2018 positions us well for the future. Our purpose is to make it different in the moments that matter and create value for our clients, our colleagues, our shareholders and the broader community. As we look to 2019 and beyond, our future is bright. Our revenue base continues to shift towards faster growing areas. We expect to see benefits from our investments in digital and technology and we are confident in our ability to complete and successfully integrate JLT. Without any impact from JLT, in 2019, we expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion, and strong adjusted EPS growth. Additionally, in 2019, we expect to reduce our share count and deliver double-digit increase in our dividend. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, Dan, and good morning. Our fourth quarter performance represented an outstanding finish to 2018. We delivered 5% underlying revenue growth highlighted by 6% growth in RIS and 3% in consulting. Consolidated revenue of 3.7 billion was up 1% or 4%, excluding the impact of the new revenue standard ASC 606. Operating income in the quarter was 621 million, while adjusted operating income increased 7% to 731 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standards, adjusted operating income increased 15%. Our adjusted operating margin expanded by 180 basis points, excluding the impact of the new revenue standard with significant expansion in both segments. Adjusted EPS increased 4% to $1.09, excluding an $0.08 per share reduction from adopting the new revenue standard, adjusted EPS grew 11% in the quarter. For the year, consolidated revenue increased 7% to 15 billion, driven by strong underlying growth of 4% and a meaningful contribution from acquisition. Adjusted operating income increased 8% to 2.9 billion, while the adjusted operating margin increased 30 basis points to 19.7%. GAAP EPS increased 13% for the year, while our adjusted EPS increased 11% to $4.35. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, fourth quarter revenue was 1.9 billion, a decrease of 2%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, revenue was up 5% and underlying revenue growth was 6%. Adjusted operating income for the quarter decreased 1% to 418 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income grew 16%, the adjusted operating margin rose 200 basis points. For the year, revenue was 8.2 billion, an increase of 8% with strong underlying growth of 5%. Adjusted operating income for the year was up 11%, and our adjusted operating margin increased to 90 basis points to 23.9%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter rose 5% to 1.8 billion, increasing 66% on an underlying basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by strong new business and retention. The U.S. and Canada division continued its trend of the strong growth delivering 7% underlying revenue growth in the quarter. International was up 5% with Asia-Pacific and Latin America up 8% and EMEA up 3%. For the year, revenue at Marsh was 6.9 billion with 4% underlying growth. In the quarter, Marsh incurred an additional 12 million of restructuring charges bringing the total to 99 million for the year. Guy Carpenter's revenue was 102 million in the quarter with underlying growth of 5%, a strong finish to another outstanding year for Guy Carpenter. For the year, revenue was 1.3 billion, with a 7% underlying growth. In the Consulting segment, fourth quarter revenue increased 4% to 1.8 billion or 3% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. Underlying revenue growth was 3%. Adjusted operating income increased 16% to 359 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income increased 9%, the adjusted operating margin increased 110 basis point. For the year, revenue was 6.8 billion, an increase of 5% with underlying revenue growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income was up 3%, and the adjusted operating margin declined 40 basis points to 17.2%. Mercer's revenue increased 3% in the quarter to 1.2 billion with underlying growth of 2%. Wealth was down 1% on an underlying basis with Investment Management & Related Services up 1%, and Defined Benefit Consulting & Administration down 2%. Our revenue in investment management was affected by the market volatility in the fourth quarter. Despite the volatility, our overall assets under delegated management ended the year at 241 billion, up 6% from year-end 2017, reflecting continued strong asset inflows. Health increased 4% on an underlying basis in the quarter, driven by solid growth in most geographies. And Career grew 5% with continued strong growth in our strategic consulting and survey businesses. For the year, revenue at Mercer was 4.7 billion with 3% underlying growth. As Dan noted, Mercer's fourth quarter results included a restructuring charge of 51 million, which we have excluded from our adjusted results. We expect additional restructuring charges under this program of approximately 20 million to 30 million in the first half of 2019. Oliver Wyman's revenue was 577 million in the quarter with an underlying increase of 7%. This result was due to strong growth in North America across all business sectors. For the year, revenue was 2 billion with 5% underlying growth. We continue to make good progress as we work towards closing the JLT transaction. As Dan mentioned, we expect to close in the spring and we’d then be in a position to update our guidance. As part of the planned financing for the acquisition, earlier this month, we issued 5 billion of senior notes across six tranches of various maturities. In the fourth quarter, we entered into contract to hedge a portion of the risk associated with changes in interest rate. As a result, we recorded a charge of 116 million, related to the change in fair value of these hedges, which were settled as part of our January issuance. With the issuance of these notes, we have completed a substantial portion of the financing required for the JLT acquisition, and currently plan to enter the market later this quarter for the remainder. We began incurring interest expense on this new debt as of January 15 and will treat this expense as a noteworthy item, net of interest income earned until the closing of the transaction. As we mentioned last quarter, in order to protect us from exchange rate volatility between announcement and closing, we entered into a deal contingent foreign exchange hedging contract. As a result of entering into this contract, we reported a non-cash charge of 225 million, reflecting the change in the fair value of the hedge instrument at the end of the quarter. The amount of this item will change as we progress towards closing, due to exchange rate volatility. Despite the volatility we will see from fair value accounting under GAAP, the cost of this hedge was contemplated in our estimate of overall transaction-related expenses. We also incurred 27 million of interest expense in the quarter, representing the amortization of fees related to our bridge facility. This 27 million is included in interest expense in our GAAP income statement. All of these costs associated with the JLT acquisition have been treated as noteworthy item. As we typically do on our fourth quarter call, I will give you a brief update on our global retirement plan. Cash contributions to our global defined benefit plans were 112 million in 2018, down from 314 million in 2017. We expect cash contributions in 2019 will be roughly in-line with the level in 2018. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a $42 million settlement charge, resulting from distribution elections made by participants in our U.K. plan. This expense, which is similar to a charge in the fourth quarter of last year is reflected as a noteworthy item. Excluding this charge, our other net benefit credit was 63 million in the quarter. For 2019, we anticipate our other net benefit credit will be essentially the same as in 2018, excluding the settlement charge. Turning to investment income, on a GAAP basis, investment income was 12 million in the fourth quarter and a 12 million loss for the full-year 2018. As we have seen throughout 2018, our GAAP investment income includes mark-to-market gains on certain equity investments as required by recent accounting changes. Because we do not view the volatility caused by these adjustments as reflective of our underlying performance, we have excluded them from our adjusted results and shown them as noteworthy items. On an adjusted basis, we have 4 million of investment income in the quarter and 18 million for the full-year 2018. For 2019, we expect only modest investment income on an adjusted basis. Foreign exchange was a slight headwind to EPS in the quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current level. We expect FX to be a modest headwind to adjusted EPS for 2019, excluding any impact from JLT. We expect the majority of this impact in the first quarter. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter was 23.6%, compared with 23.4% in the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding discrete items, our effective tax rate was approximately 27%. For the full-year 2018, our adjusted tax rate was 24.3%. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted tax rate was approximately 26%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it’s reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2019, excluding any impact from JLT. In 2018, we repurchased 8.2 million shares for 675 million. As part of the capital planning related to the JLT transaction it is unlikely we will repurchase any stock ahead of the close of the acquisition. However, in 2019, we anticipate repurchasing enough stock to satisfy our commitment to reduce our share count each year. Total debt at the end of 2018 was 5.8 billion, compared with 5.5 billion at the end of 2017. Our next debt maturity is in September 2019 when 300 million of senior notes will mature. Our cash position at the end of the fourth quarter was 1.1 billion. Uses of cash in the fourth quarter totaled 591 million and included 213 million for dividend and 378 million for acquisition. For the full-year 2018, uses of cash totaled 2.6 billion and included 675 million for share repurchases, 807 million for dividends, and 1.1 billion for acquisitions. In 2018, we delivered on our capital return commitment. We reduced our share count by 4.9 million shares of 1%, and increased our dividends per share by 10%. Before I wrap up, I want to spend a minute on our financial disclosures. Last quarter, we were asked, if we were considering changing how we report adjusted earnings per share, specifically the treatment of deal amortization. After carefully considering our current disclosures, we have decided that we will not change how we report adjusted earnings per share. We have always included transaction amortization in our earnings and have consistently challenged ourselves to overcome that cost through value creation in our acquisition. JLT doesn't change our perspective. That said, the integration of JLT will likely involve more adjustments to our numbers over the next two or three years that we have seen historically. So, we have decided to include a full cash flow statement with our press release to provide additional information to the investment community as early as possible. As you see in the statement of cash flows, which appears on Page 19 of our press release schedules, we had significant growth in operating cash flow in 2018. This is reflective of our strong operating performance and a reduction in pension contributions among other factors, and changes despite the restructuring charges at Marsh and Mercer during the year. We are also planning to change our calculation of adjusted operating margin to exclude transaction amortization so investors can get a better sense of core margin performance. We envision making this change starting with our first quarter reporting. In summary, we are proud of what we have accomplished in 2018. 7% revenue growth, 4% underlying revenue growth, 8% adjusted operating income growth, 30 basis points of adjusted margin expansion, and 11% adjusted EPS growth, all while enhancing our position for long-term growth with the acquisition of JLT. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.
Dan Glaser: Thank you, Mark. And operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question today from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kai Pan: Thank you and good morning. First, I would like to thank Dan Farrell for all the help and also want the best wishes for Sarah going forward. My first question is on the organic growth. If you look at the last three years 2016, 2017 organic growth overall 3%, and now step up in 2018 to 4%, I’m wondering if you can go through your major segment to see if that trend is going to accelerate going forward?
Dan Glaser: No, it’s a good question Kai, and obviously a lot of our focus in the company is driving organic growth. In addition to overall revenue growth, we were quite pleased with the 7% growth for the overall company this year and obviously 4% underlying is an improvement of the last couple of years. I will remind you in 2015 we were 4% and in 2014 we were 5% as an overall company. So, there’s no overall boundary in terms of what kind of performance that we can get. Obviously, RIS was strong this year, Consulting was a bit choppier. But when we look forward, we think generally the trend for the last 9 years or 10 years we’ve been bounded in that 3% to 5% organic growth area. So, unless we actually perform above 5% for a period of time, we're probably going to stay and say that 3% to 5% is the most likely outcome and we’re more likely at this stage to be above that and below that, but 3 to 5 is probably where we are in 2019.
Kai Pan: Okay. Then on the margin front, so if you grow like 4% last year, margin expanded 30 basis points, part of that because tough comp comparing with 2017, I’m wondering if you grow the same pace as last year, this year, organically will the pace of margin expansion be faster?
Dan Glaser: We would hope so. I mean, at the end, our view is that our margins this year in – we were quite satisfied with RIS, obviously consulting has been a bit choppier the last couple of years, last year or in 2017 rather was 10 bips of improvement in Consulting and this year actually being negative that’s not our regular way of operating, so we would expect that to turn around and result in better margin performance, but I would remind everybody that in this company we focus more on revenue growth and earnings growth than our margin expansions. I mean margins will expand as a natural way of us running the business where we almost always grow revenues at a faster pace than we grow expenses, but when we're sitting around the conference table, we're not talking about margin expansion. We are talking about revenue growth and net operating income growth as that is what the focus of the company is.
Kai Pan: Okay. Thank you so much.
Dan Glaser: Sure. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Ryan Tunis: Yes, thanks good morning. So, Dan I didn’t hear you call on expectation for double-digit EPS growth and I appreciate the JLT creates some challenging comparisons there, but if we just look at legacy Marsh, is it fair to expect something close to 10% plus operating earnings growth on just the legacy Marsh piece?
Dan Glaser: When I think about legacy and when you say Marsh, I guess you mean Marsh & McLennan?
Ryan Tunis: Yes, sorry.
Dan Glaser: So, overall when I think about the company, we have delivered despite a great deal of skepticism over many years, a 13% CAGR since 2009 on adjusted EPS growth with not much of a gap between our GAAP results and our reported adjusted results. So, this is real delivery. And obviously the focus on that is revenue growth and net operating income growth. With a bit of capital management, which has been relatively slight within Marsh & McLennan and the end result of that has been double-digit performance, but that – our level of double-digit performance in our view because our costs are largely controllable and visible, as long as we grow well on an underlying basis, we believe we will have strong performance on adjusted EPS. Now, obviously over the next couple of years, we have the integration of JLT. So, it’s going to be a little messier and there will be more of a gap between our reported results and our GAAP results and that’s one of the reasons as Mark was saying, they were going to show you what’s happening with cash flow as a way to really understand the value being created in the business over time.
Ryan Tunis: Okay. And then my follow-up just on Oliver Wyman better than expected this quarter, wondering if that’s just timing related and also, some perspective on what you think the drivers of that are going to be next year, I know that tends to be somewhat of an economically sensitive business? Thanks.
Dan Glaser: Sure. I’ll hand off to Scott in a second. I mean, if I look over the last five years, Oliver Wyman is our fastest growing operating company although with more volatility and that’s just part of having a business within the overall business that doesn’t have much recurring revenue, and so Oliver Wyman hit the $2 billion mark for the first time in its history, and so we're very pleased with the overall top line performance and putting that in perspective that’s almost $2 billion of new business that gets created in the given year and so it shows the strength of the organization, but we all have to pay around this table, as well as our shareholders with the notion that that result because of its non-recurring nature it has more volatility. And as you say, it’s more exposed or vulnerable to business confidence and general economic trends, but Scott, do you want to dig in a little deeper?
Scott McDonald: Yes. Brian let me reinforce a few of the things Dan said. I mean because of the nature of the business there is little guarantee of recurring revenue, and our visibility on backlog is typically somewhere between four weeks and three months depending on market conditions and the type of work we’re selling. And given that we do see volatility quarter-to-quarter and we can either overshoot or undershoot our best estimates of where we're going to be in the next quarter. And as Dan highlighted for the company this is largely a revenue rather than an NOI issue because our comp model is very tightly aligned with revenue. Now in the second half of 2018, and particularly in the fourth quarter, we did see much stronger demand than we’ve been expecting across the entire portfolio and that led to the strong performance you’ve seen. That’s good news for the business and it does suggest to us that despite the daily forecast of gloom and doom for the global economy individual businesses are still pursuing initiatives that require consulting support. So, my view hasn't changed that we still think this business should generate mid-to-high single-digit growth over time. There’s still market share for us to take and I think we’re in good shape for 2019.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Scott. Thanks Ryan. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. We now move to Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Mike Zaremski: Hi, good morning. As a follow-up to Ryan's question about adjusted EPS growth ex-JLT, if I’m understanding correctly it sounds like directionally, you're backing off the previous 13% EPS growth goal and if that’s correct, I was just kind of wondering what’s changed?
Dan Glaser: I don't know where you got that because it’s not accurate. The reality is, we have never had guidance around adjusted EPS growth. Our guidance that came out of our last Investor Day was that we will grow our dividend double-digit each year and we would reduce our share count each year and we also said that our view was over long stretches of time, not particularly every year, and not particularly every quarter that we will deliver a long-term CAGR around 13% in our view. Now, we have had ups and downs to that, obviously we’ve had stronger adjusted EPS performance in the early stages when we're having dramatic margin expansion, you know 8 and 7 years ago, but we have still had double-digit adjusted EPS growth and last year was particularly strong for a variety of different reasons. And so, our view remains that over a long stretch of time, we believe that adjusted EPS growth of around 13% is achievable. Now, it requires having better growth than 3% underlying. Now whether that, I mean obviously it becomes easier at 5 and 6 than it is at 4, but we absolutely believe that there is strong opportunity in the company to continue to deliver very good adjusted EPS growth. And I mean, it’s just – just to take a moment and talk a little bit about the component parts because obviously revenue growth, margin expansion, capital management delivers adjusted EPS growth. And when your margins are low, then you can have pretty dramatic margin expansion, which makes double-digit adjusted EPS growth more of a layout. Now that we have very strong margins, it becomes more difficult and it means that the top line becomes more important. So, if I look back 6, 7, 8 years ago it was a margin expansion story. Now, it becomes a topline achievement required in order to deliver the adjusted EPS growth that we’ve delivered in the past.
Mike Zaremski: Okay understood. Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Do you have a follow-up?
Mike Zaremski: Yes. One follow-up. Mark did you give tax rate guidance for 2019? I believe that some of your peers are waiting for the Treasury to issue a bunch of guidance which they issued potentially back this past December? Thanks.
Mark McGivney: Yes. I said in my script, the outlook for this year, 2019, is between 25% and 26%, excluding discrete items and also without regard to any impact from JLT.
Mike Zaremski: Okay, so no major changes year-over-year. Thanks.
Dan Glaser: Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. We now move to Meyer Shields of KBW. Please go ahead.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. Mark, can you quantify whether or I guess discuss whether there is any impact on the individual segment margins from foreign exchange swings in the quarter?
Mark McGivney: Overall, as I said, FX was a modest headwind in the quarter, but it was modest. And so, the level of significance to margins in earnings by segment was relatively insignificant, which is why we didn’t call it out.
Meyer Shields: Okay. That’s fair. Broadly speaking, I think it’s more of a question for Dan. Given the tight employment markets. Do you need more organic growth now to translate into natural margin expansion that would have been the case 2, 3, 4 years ago?
Dan Glaser: Not quite sure I understand your question Meyer. Do you want to give it another go?
Meyer Shields: Sure. I’m basically asking whether there is a higher natural upward drift in compensation expenses now than in past years just because of the domestic employment situation?
Dan Glaser: We like a lot of others have watched whether wage inflation appears. You will see in our disclosures that our compensation line from a fixed basis, our comp and ben line, is mildly lower as a percentage of revenue than it was last year. And so, it certainly is not manifesting. One of the benefits that we have is that our bonus arrangements are driven off of earnings, and so I’m pleased to say that 2018 will be the tenth consecutive year of the overall Marsh & McLennan Companies’ bonus pool has increased. And so that gives us some flexibility to manage fixed cost because of the increases in our variable compensation.
Meyer Shields: Okay. Excellent. Thanks so much.
Dan Glaser: Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. We now move to Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, good morning. My first question kind of goes back to your organic growth outlook, the 3% to 5% range for this coming year. Dan, you know we’ve had some folks kind of speculating whether or not we’re going to go into a recession either late this year, maybe that’s something that’s more 2020, I guess, just interested in a broader view, if we do go into recession on your brokerage business very economically sensitive, how do you see that playing out? And then, could you remind us if we, you know as we’ve gone into past recessions, is there a lag like how should we think about the potential for a recession to flow through into the revenue within your brokerage business?
Dan Glaser: I mean, obviously expansions and recessions are a natural part of the economic cycle, and it’s interesting how basically the watch has begun for when will the next recession occur. We don't have a view about that. What we would say you, you know in the worst financial crisis in generations, RIS was down 1% in 2009, consulting was down around 6%, and then bounced back strongly the following year in 2010. I would say from an overall standpoint; our recurring revenue businesses are more resilient and more insulated from immediate economic impacts, and so you’d have to have deep and long recession to have a significant impact. Oliver Wyman tends to be a little bit of our canary in the coal mine because usually in recessions companies start reducing discretionary expenses or projects related to the future because they humper down to deal with the present. And right now, as you heard from Scott, we’re not seeing it. That doesn't mean that there won't be some sort of recession sometime in either the 2020, 2021, 2022, I was saying that on when I was interviewed in Davos. But ultimately, the impact on our business relative to other companies in the S&P 500 is far milder because of the level of requirement around many of our businesses and the advice that we give.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, that’s helpful. And then my second question, I was hoping if we can get a little bit of an update on Marsh & McLennan Agency, MMA. So, strong growth within the U.S. and Canada in the quarter, could you comment or just give us a little sense, usually MMA growth is faster than the rest of Marsh, is that still the case and can you just provide an update on how that business has been trending and where the revenue sits today?
Dan Glaser: I’m thrilled with the question because Mark and I are here running corporate and we've got these guys around the table who are running big businesses and have delivered a fantastic result for the year, but John you want to talk a little bit about MMA?
John Doyle: Sure. Thanks for putting me to work, Elyse. So, MMA had a terrific year again. They continue to execute well, strong underlying growth performing quite well, what I’m particularly encouraged about, you know that Dave and his team are operating a better together campaign. So, they're working and leaning on each other within the agency, better than they ever have and leaning in to Marsh as well, grabbing resource when it can, helping Marsh in other parts of the world develop its middle-market value proposition and its sales strategies in other parts of the world. You know what I would say their year in 2018 was, it was very consistent between P&C and benefits and really by region. So, there's a lot to feel good about, and I would remind you, as big as the business has become, we have a relatively modest market share as well. So, if we see plenty of opportunity for growth in the future.
Dan Glaser: As we mentioned before as well, just adding to John's comments. We have good acquisition pipeline within the agency and despite the significant commitment with regard to JLT, we have provided for continuing funding for acquisitions within Marsh & McLennan Agency.
John Doyle: I could make one other comment too Dan because I think Elyse asked about the comparisons to the rest of the U.S. business. Marsh U.S. had a very strong year, this year as well. So, certainly, ordinarily MMA's organic growth has outpaced Marsh U.S., but Marsh U.S. had a terrific year, this year.
Dan Glaser: Thank you. Next question please. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Larry Greenberg of Janney Montgomery Scott has our next question. Please go ahead.
Larry Greenberg: Thank you, and good morning. Just looking at within Marsh and the international segment, it appears that organic was trending up over the course of the year, and certainly the fourth quarter was pretty impressive, are there any underlying trends to decipher there or is that just the episodic nature of the markets?
Dan Glaser: John.
John Doyle: Sure. What I would say is, on the international side, we had consistent strong performance in Latin America, Asia, Continental Europe, so really broadly speaking had terrific results internationally. As I pointed out on prior calls, during the course of 2018, we’re facing some headwinds in the Middle East and also in the UK, both rebounded a bit in the fourth quarter, a bit stronger performance in the Middle East and in Africa in the fourth quarter and we made some leadership changes there as we talked about in the past. Terrific team, making a difference and I expect good solid growth in the Middle East during 2019. The UK leadership changes have also taken hold and I’m seeing some good positive signs. Having said that, there are obviously some macro headwinds in the UK. So, I don't expect the UK to be leading the overall growth in Marsh in 2019, but I do on the other hand and think we're performing much better than we did about a year ago.
Larry Greenberg: Thanks. And then just maybe some comments on your view of commercial lines market conditions, we haven't had many underwriters report to date, but there seems to be, maybe a slight bit of optimism in the year of maybe some acceleration in pricing in some areas of the marketplace, just curious of your view of where things stand?
John Doyle: Okay. I’ll give you some data rather than optimism or pessimism maybe. Pricing was up nearly 2% in the fourth quarter, versus 1.4% in the third quarter. The U.S. and UK, which as you know is a big part of our business overall. Pricing was slightly up on average. Australia remains the outlier market, where prices are relatively firm on average, 10-plus percent increases across most product lines. Most other countries, pricing is right around the 1% on the increase range. Product view of casualty was down slightly, primarily due to work comp in the U.S., and I would say most other casualty lines are up couple of points on average, but work comp brings that average down. Property prices didn’t move much in the fourth quarter, compared to earlier in 2018. They were up about 3.5% in the quarter. In financial lines, D&O pricing, the E&O pricing, prices were up over 4%, which was about 100 basis point increase from what we saw in the third quarter. I would say, before I ask maybe Peter to jump in here, the market was a bit choppier at the end of the year, there’s no questions. So, I think the range of outcomes was a bit wider than what we had seen earlier in the year, although the average didn’t more all that much, and capital levels do remain strong. So, I certainly wouldn't project. I would anticipate continued – relatively stable market on average.
Dan Glaser: Peter?
Peter Hearn: Thank you. Larry, I would say that overall, if I look at the 1/1 renewals of the reinsurance market, they were muted and it really was a function of clients who experienced loss activity, particularly in the recessional and the property markets more than any other market that we saw. Casualty was – pricing was relatively stable. In the United States, we saw some downturn in pricing in the European renewals, but overall, I’d say pricing was muted. We didn't see any significant increases.
Dan Glaser: Thanks. Next question please. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Jay Cohen of Bank of America has our next question. Please go ahead.
Jay Cohen: Thank you. I just want to echo the thoughts on Dan Farrell. He's done a great job as IR person and good luck of course to the next team coming in. So, question on the U.S. and Canada, the organic growth there, obviously strong. If you just look at GDP growth, maybe a little bit of tailwind from pricing, but not much, you’d guess that you guys are gaining share in the U.S. and Canada. And I’m wondering, one if that’s the case? And secondly, if that is the case where is that share gain? Where is it? What products or what parts of the business?
Dan Glaser: First of all – yes, I will hand of to John in a second, but we tend not to talk about market shares although some other do because it’s not audited, there is not third party that calculates this in the U.S. and when I look at some marketing materials here and there, it seems like everybody has got a very high share, and so ultimately we’re out there account by account in different segments of the market. I think the variety of our businesses is also very helpful because we're highly specialized, highly segmented, but John do you want to give some color into individual pockets of particular strength in the U.S./Canada?
John Doyle: Sure. Jay, I talked about MMA before, so maybe I'll just focus on Marsh U.S. They had a terrific quarter, as I said, very strong new business in the year. Retention also picked up during the course of the year, which is a year-on-year phenomenon so that certainly helps with the roll over into what we saw on 2018. We had good specialties performance across the board, maybe to highlight a few areas that had particularly strong growth. Our private equity group, which advices portfolio companies and PE firms had terrific growth in the year. Transaction risk, given the M&A market, an increasing penetration into adding insurance as a means to help get deals closed at very strong growth. Cyber, of course, continues to grow and now is becoming a meaningful part of our portfolio. Marsh Risk Consulting also had a very strong year in the U.S. and rest of world by the way, but had terrific growth advising clients on how to really bend their risk curve over time. Our underwriting operations, Victor, Torrent and ICAT, also had terrific years this year. So, all of that contributed to a really – really since we've been reporting this way, the best year on record for Marsh in the U.S. You mentioned Canada briefly. And Chris Lay, who had moved into Canada a couple of years ago and now is leading our UK operations really set the stage nicely and Sarah Robson stepped in early in 2018 to take over that operation. They had their best quarter and best year of growth in a long-long time in Canada. There's obviously a mature market there. So, some of the products in Canada that grew are the same that saw good outcomes in the United States, but yes it was a really strong performance across really most businesses in the United States.
Dan Glaser: Anything else, Jay?
Jay Cohen: No, that’s it, John. Very helpful answer as usual. Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Operator, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian Meredith: Yes, thank you. First Mark, thanks for providing the cash flow statement, it’s really helpful. And a quick question on it. If I take a look at your free cash flow that you generated for the year, obviously a really, really strong part of it, a big part of it the pension drop. But even ex the pension, it looks like $350 million increase in free cash flow, is there anything unusual kind of happening this year on the free cash flow working capital or could we expect to ex-JLT to continue to see that kind of strength in free cash flow generation?
Mark McGivney: Actually, if you look down the column in 2018 there is relative stability in a lot of the balance sheet items that could swing around. So, it was pretty straightforward and pretty strong and as simple as strong operating earnings growth and the 200 or so million dollars reduction in pension contribution. Those were the big drivers. If you look back to 2017, there was a lot geography noise with some of the accounting around tax reform. The 2018 was pretty clean and as Dan said, JLT is going to involve some noise over the next two or three years, but excluding that, our outlook would be that it's for a strong earnings growth and we would expect strong cash flow growth as well.
Brian Meredith: Great. And then my second question, just going to Mercer. You announced additional restructuring charge going on here, may be little behind the restructuring, is that simply because of the organic growth at Mercer just trying to keep margins stable or is that margin accretive, kind of what’s the thought process behind that?
Dan Glaser: I’ll start by just saying, we don't – we’re not doing restructurings, even mild restructurings with margins in mind. We do restructurings based upon how we look as a go forward business, but Julio?
Julio Portalatin: Thank you, Brian. As Dan mentioned, our ability to be able to continue to look at our business day-in and day-out and maximize opportunities, to invest where it’s necessary to do so to accelerate growth, comparable growth, and also to disinvest in some of the areas of our business as well is pretty much what we’re trying to do at this point with this restructuring. The investments that we’ve made in areas of data analytics, digital, middle market expansion, of course our very successful investment management business, our health benefit platform, and several acquisitions that we’ve made or indeed experiencing accelerated growth. As you know, we’ve had some challenges with some portions of our business that we've discussed in past, but today the fast-changing landscape requires that we review in our position and take action when needed to accelerate some further investments and, as I said, disinvestments, which are prudent in our business. We’ll continue to do that and our earnings obviously will be positively impacted by some of the actions that we’re taking and it’ll continue to give us some, let's say, tailwind as we go into 2019.
Brian Meredith: Got you. So, if I understand correctly, it's basically to be able to invest in other areas, this is kind of the – it will be offset with investment?
Julio Portalatin: I mean the restructured combines growth and investment with actions and improved efficiencies.
Brian Meredith: Okay.
Dan Glaser: So, there will be some tailwind as Julio said on the bottom line and on margins within consulting as a result, but it won't all drop.
Brian Meredith: Great. Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Operator, next question please
Operator: David Styblo with Jefferies has our next question. Please go ahead.
David Styblo: Sure. Thanks for taking the questions Dan. I’ll keep the executive team involved. My first one is, just on Guy Carpenter, the fourth quarter number is 5% that was pretty solid, especially in-light of last year's tough comp, and I think maybe at least half of that 7% growth a year ago was from storm activities. So curious to hear a little bit about the strength in the business. You guys had even talked about the fourth quarter being more tempered, so it’s obviously been a really strong year and curious to hear a little bit more about the sustainability of the 7% growth that you guys have experienced for full-year?
Dan Glaser: Thanks. Peter?
Peter Hearn: Yes, thank you, David. I mean obviously it was a very good year. We’re very pleased with it, and we expect some quarterly volatility in the growth rates in terms of the results of the phasing of the revenue that we now have, but we continue to build the business to grow irrespective of the macro environment. And I mean, if you look at our business, our new business growth over the past two years has been significant. We have strong disciplined pipelines that we continue to manage on a monthly basis, and it’s bearing the fruit that we've made the investments in people and infrastructure to create strong pipelines and strong new business growth.
David Styblo: It’s helpful thanks. And then maybe Dan coming back to you, the overall business obviously has some very strong momentum as you’re exiting the year, Especially in RIS, you've had like a 5% organic growth, 5% organic growth, 6%, I know you would like to talk about the last four quarters. I guess as you stand here and you’re going forward into 2019 how – and there are certain tailwinds that are coming, it seems like EMEA is starting to turn the corner after it was having some tough times, how sustainable is that performance, particularly in light of your earlier comments about how important it is to drive the top line more than margin expansion because margins have increased a lot over the last decade and then I will contribute as much? So, the bottom line now is, as the top line in organic growth. So, just thinking about the points of emphasis to making sure we have as much line of sight as possible in the top line. How do you view that sustainability of the organic growth trends that you’ve seen particularly in the back half?
Dan Glaser: Well, the way I look at it is, all four of our businesses are run well. And have done things over a number your years to position us well for long-term growth and for improving profitability. Obviously, we exist in the world so matter of factors impact us just like they do to everybody else, but where there is growth in the world, I believe Marsh & McLennan will be on the ground with growth strategies and good execution to capture that growth. So, I don't think there has been a time in our history as a company where we are better positioned either strategically, financially, or operationally and so we're looking forward, not just to 2019, but to the years beyond that as well.
David Styblo: Okay, thanks.
Dan Glaser: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Dan Glaser for any additional or closing remarks.
Dan Glaser: Thank you, operator. And thanks to everybody for joining us on the call this morning. I want to convey my appreciation to our clients for their support and give a special shout-out to all of our [65,000 colleagues] for continuing to deliver outstanding results for our clients and for our shareholders. We have two core priorities right now at Marsh & McLennan. First, execute on our plan; and second, set up a great integration with JLT. And I am delighted with the progress that we are making on both fronts. So, thank you all very much. Enjoy the rest of your day.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Third Quarter 2018 Financial Results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com. Please be advised that the call is being recorded. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more details discussion of such factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you and good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses. John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter who is dialing in from London; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Dan Farrell, Head of Investor Relations. The third quarter was eventful for Marsh & McLennan. I am pleased with our overall financial results for the quarter and I will talk about them a bit later. Without a doubt, the major highlight of the third quarter was our agreement to acquire Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group. We are progressing with the regulatory and shareholder approval process. In the U.S., we recently received antitrust regulatory approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, concluding the competition review of both the FTC and Department of Justice. Also, JLT has announced it will hold a General Meeting of Shareholders on November 7 for the purpose of obtaining shareholder approval. As we move forward, the transaction remains subject to additional antitrust and regulatory approvals. At this point, we expect closing sometime in the spring of next year. Our executive committee spent last week in London getting to know the senior leadership of JLT better as well as addressing the broader JLT colleague base through a large town hall meeting. There is tremendous energy and optimism on both sides around the benefits this acquisition will bring to clients, colleagues and shareholders. Following these meetings, I am even more excited about the strategic potential for our combined organization. The process of planning our future together has begun in earnest. Teams of leaders from both organizations are involved in this effort and decisions will be made from the perspective of bringing the best of both. While JLT is a large transaction for us, we have a strong track record of M&A having executed nearly 160 transactions since the beginning of 2009. Over that time, we have had success in retaining key talent and maintaining the unique qualities of the organizations we acquire. While no integration is seamless, the combined leadership team has the depth of experience and industry knowledge to grasp the challenges ahead and execute successfully. As I have said previously, this is a combination out of strength on both sides. It is about one thing, growth, growth in talent, capabilities, revenues, margins, and earnings. Dominic Burke and the JLT management team have built a terrific organization that is highly skilled with a strong track record of growth. Together, we'll deliver even more value for clients. It further solidifies our position as the leading global professional services firm providing advice and solutions in the areas of risk, strategy and people. We will have the broadest and deepest talent in the industry. Marsh McLennan will be the single-best place to work, the employer of choice and the organization where creative and highly-skilled people will optimize their talent. We will have a relentless focus on clients and improving the client experience. The strength of our combined organization and the unmatched capabilities we bring will be the driving force for client and colleague satisfaction. We will have deeper industry expertise, stronger geographic positioning, and greater capacity for investments in digital, data and analytical capabilities, which will benefit our clients. We will be out in front of their greatest challenges with innovation and thought leadership. In addition to the JLT news, we had an active M&A quarter on other fronts. During the quarter, Mercer announced the acquisitions of Pavilion Financial Group and Summit Strategies Group within the Wealth division. These transactions, which represent approximately $90 million of combined revenues will strengthen Mercer's investment consulting position in the endowment, healthcare and insurance sectors while adding capabilities in alternative investments. Both firms bring high-quality talent as evidenced by their strong scores in the Greenwich Associates Quality Index for investment consulting. In early October Marsh & McLennan Agency acquired Eustis Insurance & Benefits, a Louisiana based agency with $17 million of revenue. While deleveraging the balance sheet will be a priority over the next couple of years, we have provided for the flexibility to continue to pursue selective acquisitions and MMA will be the primary focus given the significant success of this strategy over the last decade. With MMA, we have built the highest quality middle market brokerage business in the industry and we will continue to support their development. I would also like to highlight some leadership changes in Mercer. Martine Ferland was recently named to the newly created position of Group President reporting to Julio. Martine brings more than 30 years of experience in consulting, leadership strategy and delivering client value, having run businesses in Canada, Europe, Pacific, Asia and the U.S. Under Martine, we will be further simplifying and combining Mercer's three geographic regions into two, U.S.-Canada and International. This aligns more closely with the regional structures in place across the other businesses of MMC. As part of this change, we also announced that David Anderson will lead the newly established international region and that Louis Gagnon will be the new leader for U.S. Canada. Both David and Louis will report to Martine. Now, let me give some highlights of our performance for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018. Revenue growth in the quarter was strong. Consolidated revenue was $3.5 billion, up 5% or 7% excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. Underlying revenue growth in the quarter was 5%. With 5% growth in both RIS and Consulting the first time that both segments have had 5% or better underlying growth since the third quarter of 2011. Marsh had 3% underlying revenue growth driven by strong growth of 5% in U.S.-Canada, a continuation of the momentum we saw in the first half of the year. In Guy Carpenter we saw 11% underlying revenue growth in the quarter, bringing them to 7% underlying growth year-to-date. This reflected strong performance across the business. Mercer's 3% underlying revenue growth was driven by continued strength in investments, health and career. Oliver Wyman grew underlying revenue 11%, which was better than our expectations going into the quarter. As for our bottom line results, adjusted operating income grew 3% and adjusted earnings per share increased 8% in the quarter, excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. NOI growth and margin expansion in RIS were strong, offset by expected softness in Consulting, which was driven by the difficult expense in comparison to 2017 that we mentioned last quarter. For the nine months, our consolidated underlying revenue growth stands at 4% and adjusted EPS increased 10% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. In the aggregate, our results for the first nine months position us well to deliver another solid year. For the full-year, we expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion and strong adjusted EPS growth. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.
Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Dan, and good morning. In the third quarter, we delivered 5% underlying revenue growth highlighted by underlying growth of 5% in both RIS and consulting. Overall revenue was up 5% or 7% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard ASC 606. For the first nine months of the year, underlying revenue growth was a solid 4%. Operating income in the quarter was $541 million, while adjusted operating income decreased 5% to $535 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income increased 3%. Overall, our adjusted operating margin declined by 30 basis points, excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. GAAP EPS declined to $0.54. Adjusted EPS declined 1% to $0.78. Excluding a $0.07 per share reduction from adopting the new revenue standard adjusted EPS grew 8%. For the first nine months of 2018, GAAP EPS increased 4%, while our adjusted EPS increased 14% to $3.26. Excluding a $0.10 per share benefit from adopting the new revenue standard, adjusted EPS was up 10%. In Risk & Insurance Services, third quarter revenue was $1.9 billion, an increase of 6% or 9% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. Underlying revenue growth was 5%. Adjusted operating income for the quarter decreased 3% to $283 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standards, adjusted operating income grew 13% and adjusted margin rose 110 basis points. For the nine months, revenue was $6.3 billion, an increase of 11% or 9% excluding the impact of the new revenue standards. Underlying revenue growth was 4%. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year was up 15%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standards, adjusted operating income increased 10% and our adjusted operating margin increased 30 basis points to 23.9%. At March, revenue in the quarter was $1.6 billion with overall growth of 10% and underlying growth of 3%. The U.S. and Canada division continued its trend of strong growth, delivering 5% underlying revenue growth in the quarter. International was up 2%. For the first nine months, revenue at Marsh was $5.1 billion, up 8% or 3% on an underlying basis. Marsh incurred restructuring charges of $29 million in the quarter and $87 million through the first nine months of the year. We now expect ultimate charges to be towards the high end of our previous $80 million to $100 million range. Also, adjusted operating results exclude $46 million gain in the quarter on the sale of our risk management software and services business in Marsh. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $215 million in the quarter with underlying growth of 11%. This is the seventh quarter in a row of 4% or higher underlying revenue growth for Guy Carpenter, and the highest underlying growth since the second quarter of 2009. For the first nine months of the year, revenue was $1.2 billion with 7% underlying growth. Year-to-date, Guy Carpenter's performance is strong and they are on track to deliver a terrific year. We anticipate their results will temper in the fourth quarter, given the benefit from the significant reinstatement and back-up activity we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. In Consulting, third (00:14:11) quarter revenue was $1.7 billion, up 4% both including and excluding the impact of the new revenue standards. Underlying revenue growth was 5%. Adjusted operating income decreased 6% to $293 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income declined 6%, and the adjusted margin declined by 210 basis points. This decline was expected due to a tough expense comparison, primarily driven by variable compensation adjustments at Mercer in the third quarter last year. Consulting's underlying revenue growth for the first nine months of 2018 was 4% with consolidated revenue of $5 billion. For the first nine months, adjusted operating income was down 2%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income decreased 1%. Mercer's revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter with underlying growth of 3%. Wealth grew 2% on an underlying basis with Investment Management & Related Services up 9%, and Defined Benefit Consulting & Administration down 3%. Our delegated asset management business continues to show strong growth with assets under delegated management of $248 billion at quarter end. Health increased 4% on an underlying basis in the quarter and Career grew 5%. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $3.5 billion with 3% underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue was $481 million in the quarter with underlying increase of 11%. This result was solid and reflects strength in most practices offsetting continued softness in bank regulatory work. For the first nine months of the year, revenue was $1.5 billion with 5% underlying growth. Given the performance of Oliver Wyman in the third quarter, our outlook for revenue growth has improved a bit. We now expect modest growth in Oliver Wyman for the second half of 2018 as opposed to our previous guidance of flat. This would imply a decline in fourth quarter revenue in Oliver Wyman on an underlying basis. As Dan mentioned, we have begun integration planning for JLT and are progressing with the regulatory and shareholder approval process. On balance, the key elements of guidance we provided on our investor call on September 18 have not changed. And I want to reiterate some of the highlights. We expect the deal would be accretive to adjusted EPS in year one, excluding intangible amortization, and will produce a double-digit IRR. Transaction is expected to be modestly dilutive to adjusted GAAP EPS in year one, neutral in year two, and accretive in year three. This is an all-cash transaction that will be funded primarily with debt. The amount of incremental debt will be based on the equity purchase price of $5.6 billion, the amount of JLT debt outstanding and fees and other costs associated with the transaction. We continue to estimate annual after tax intangible amortization of $180 million or $240 million on a pre-tax basis. And from a capital management perspective, we have carefully planned the financing in order to maintain our longstanding capital return commitments and maintain a strong ratings profile. The third quarter also included a couple of noteworthy items related to the JLT acquisition. In order to protect us from exchange rate volatility between announcement and closing, we entered into a Deal Contingent Foreign Exchange hedging contract. As a result of entering into this contract, we recorded a noncash charge of $100 million reflecting the change in the fair value of the hedge instrument at the end of the quarter. The amount of this item will change as we progress to closing as well as due to exchange rate volatility. Despite the volatility we will see from fair value accounting under GAAP, the full cost of this hedge was contemplated in our estimate of overall transaction cost. We also incurred $3 million of expense from the amortization of fees related to our bridge facilities. This $3 million is included in interest expense in our GAAP income statement. Lastly, we are pleased that subsequent to our announcement both Moody's and S&P affirmed our current ratings albeit with a change in outlook that was expected. Turning to investment income, on an adjusted basis, we had $4 million in the quarter and we continue to expect the contribution from investment income in the fourth quarter will be immaterial. On a GAAP basis, investment income was a loss of $52 million in the quarter and included an $81 million write-down of the value of our investment in Alexander Forbes in order to bring our carrying value in line with the current trading value of their share. This adjustment was partially offset by mark-to-market gains on other equity investments as required by recent accounting changes. It's important to note that the adjustment to our carrying value of Alexander Forbes was noncash and purely due to their stock's trading value. Because we do not view the volatility caused by these adjustments as reflective of our underlying performance, we've excluded them from our adjusted results and shown them as noteworthy items. Foreign exchange in the quarter was a slight drag in both revenue and overall NOI. Assuming exchange rates remain at current level, we expect FX to be a slight headwind to revenue and NOI for the fourth quarter. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 25.3%, compared with 26.6% in the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted tax rate included a net benefit of $4 million from discrete items. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 26%. Through the first nine months of the year, our adjusted tax rate was 24.5%, compared with 26.1% last year. For the remainder of the year, we expect our effective tax rate excluding discrete items will be approximately 26%, consistent with the underlying rate we have seen through the first nine months of the year. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $6.2 billion, compared with $5.5 billion at the end of 2017. During the quarter, we amended and extended our committed credit facility for a new five-year period. As part of the renewal, the facility was increased by $300 million to a total of $1.8 billion. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we also repaid $250 million of senior notes that were due in October. Our next scheduled debt maturity is $300 million of senior notes due in September 2019. In the third quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of stock for $175 million. Through nine months, we have repurchased 8.2 million shares for $675 million. As part of our capital planning related to the JLT acquisition, it is unlikely we will repurchase any stock for the remainder of 2018 and into the early part of 2019. In 2019, however, we do anticipate repurchasing enough stock to meet our commitment to reduce our share count each year. Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $1 billion. Uses of cash in the third quarter totaled $820 million and included $175 million for share repurchases, $211 million for dividend, and $434 million for acquisition. For the first nine months, uses of cash totaled $2 billion and included $675 million for share repurchases, $594 million for dividend, and $691 million for acquisitions. As you heard in Dan's remarks, 2018 has been another active year for acquisitions. As a result, we expect to deploy $2.6 billion of capital in 2018 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks Mark. Operator, we're ready to begin the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. In the interest of addressing questions from as many participants as possible, we would ask that all participants limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. We will take our first question today from Morgan Stanley, Kai Pan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you and good morning. So, my first question on JLT, Dan, just follow-up on your comments you have spoken with the clients and employees over the last months. And I just wondered can you give some example to see your comfort levels about a potential revenue opportunity or decent synergy if there's any risk as well as a $250 million cost-saving target? And also if you can confirm – if you can like discuss if you're going to report cash EPS going forward after the deal close.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. So, let me take the first part of that question, and then I'll take the second part, and hand it over to Mark. So, the – our entire MMC executive team, leadership team spent last week in London, and we met with many people at JLT, and then we had a town hall which had around 1,500 people, and so it was a great display on both sides of talking about the industry and the business. We didn't get into a lot of specifics in anything. I mean, we're still in a period where there's a shareholder vote, November 7. We're still working through regulatory approval, so it's fairly high-level. And of course, we're not reaching out as Marsh McLennan to any JLT clients. We've obviously been contacted by some of our clients. And we view on an overall basis. Clients make decisions based upon capabilities not based upon individuals, not based upon what badge the company is carrying. It is the capabilities of the firm. And so that gives me a lot of comfort in thinking that the capabilities of the combined firm will be stronger than how we operate as individual companies. I mean I did get a real sense from the JLT leadership team and the extended leadership team as to what kind of esprit de corps they have and the camaraderie and the chemistry. And so, I'm really looking for JLT to be a jolt of energy within Marsh & McLennan and as I've said on the initial call last month, both organizations are operating in a position of strength right now. We are both stronger than we were three years ago. And bringing us together at this moment in time is really powerful and I think more than anything else, we'll deliver increased value to clients. Now, I mean obviously we're not going to know until things go on for many more months and even years about the puts and takes of any large acquisition. We're confident that this will work out for both firms and certainly for our clients, our colleagues, and our shareholders. As I said in the first call, Kai, we're a conservative company. So we didn't model this thing in a way that creates a lot of strain in terms of – will we get this kind of expense synergy and will we get this kind of revenue dyssynergy and what will happen over a longer stretch in time on the revenue side. Time and time again, we went the conservative route. The math still worked and so from that standpoint, I'm quite comfortable that this will turn out to be somewhere between a very good and a spectacular acquisition for Marsh & McLennan.
Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Dan, you want me to...?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I did. Sure. Why don't you take the cash EPS question?
Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Hi, Kai. How are you doing?
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good.
Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: So, JLT is obviously a large transaction and it's going to have a lot of financial reporting implications, not the least of which as you intimate (00:27:54). There's going to be a lot of noncash intangible amortization coming through our P&L and it's actually common in a lot of large transactions where companies will make a switch to exclude that from their adjusted results. But all of that said we're still working through all. This is a large transaction. We're still working through all of the reporting implications. And we haven't reached any conclusions on that or other implications for how we report and I would expect in our fourth quarter call we'll have a lot more perspective.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's very good. Yes. My follow-up is on the margin side. You have a full year guidance on the sort of full year margin expansion. If you look at first nine months, you're probably 30 basis point below last year on old accounting basis, which imply you might have to sort of improve margin about 100 basis point in the fourth quarter to make it up. I just wonder what's your – what give you comfort that you can see a big margin expansion in the fourth quarter? As well as, can you confirm that the margin expansion year-over-year is on old accounting basis, what about on new accounting basis compared with a year ago?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. So certainly, the margin expansion that we're talking about is on the old accounting basis and is comparable to the way that we've always reported to you in the past. And I would like to say, yeah, we're anticipating a pretty good fourth quarter at least on the bottom line side of things And so, I'm comfortable saying that we believe 2018 will be our 11th consecutive year of margin expansion for the overall company, notwithstanding the fact that through nine months we're at 30 bps of contraction. And I would just say to – on a broader basis, and I've said this many times before, while we do see continued opportunity for operating leverage in both segments, you have to understand that our focus as a leadership team is more on earnings growth than on margin expansion. We believe that margin expansion is an outcome of running a business properly where revenue growth exceeds expense growth. It's very infrequently that we get upside down and we recognize that the Consulting division has been upside down. We don't expect it to stay upside down. But yes, it's been upside down thus far this year. When we look at this year in general, it's a bit of an odd year, and if another question from somebody else wants us to get back into the details of the things that we talked about last quarter that we would, we'll do that. Now, I answered your question on the old accounting basis. Mark, do you have any comments?
Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. So, Kai, when we make the statement about margin expansion for the year, it is on the old basis of accounting. Remember, we didn't restate last year, and so we don't – we're not really projecting externally that way. Although, you'd expect given that there shouldn't be much year-over-year difference, you'd expect margin lift in either case.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you so much for all the answers.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. We now take our next question from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on Guy Carpenter, pretty strong organic growth, 11% in the quarter, in your opening comments you guys pointed to kind of broad-based growth throughout. If we can just get some more details there and then reinsurance is typically a very high margin business. Was that the driver of the margin improvement within RIS in the quarter? Or was there some margin improvement also coming from Marsh which did see 3% growth? And then, if we can also just get a little bit of an initial view for January 1 renewals next year? I know you're a little tempered for fourth quarter given reinstatements last year, but how is the reinsurance business looking in your minds as we think about 2019.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. So before I hand off to Peter, I would just say that we report margins on a segment basis, so we don't want to go fall into the trap of talking about individual operating businesses and what their margins are. You know a lot about our business more than most and so I'll just leave it at that. But the overall margin on the segment has been pretty good this year and we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. But Peter, you want to talk about Guy Carpenter and the growth and how you see things going into January 1.
Peter C. Hearn - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Thank you, Dan. Elyse, the growth in Q3 was well balanced across all three of our three businesses and our facultative business as well, and we saw particularly strong results from the U.S. and specials – and our Specialty businesses driven by growth on our health book and good new business growth as well. As I've stated before and I'll state again, we don't make pronouncements on where the market is headed because it will find its own equilibrium. We believe capital is still abundant and demand, well not fundamentally increasing, has increased 2018 over 2017.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Elyse, do you have another question?
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah, so my second question, in terms of margins. Just a follow-up to Kai's question; do you expect – you said Consulting should get better over time, would you expect to see some margin improvement there in the fourth quarter? And my second question, since we're modeling on revenue recognition adjusted, it does seem that the impact to EPS on a year-to-date basis was more positive than you would have laid out in your From 8-K earlier this year. Is there going to be a giveback of about that $0.10 in the fourth quarter? Or should we think about there being maybe a positive impact on full-year numbers, just because we're modeling off of that adjusted last year? I just want to make sure we're all setting our expectations correctly.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay, so let me take the margin question and then I'll hand off to Mark to talk about the accounting nature. Your comment about margins, do we expect margins in the Consulting segment to go up in the fourth quarter? Yes, that is our expectation. Do we expect margins in the Consulting segment to be able to go up in the future or will they remain upside down? Looking at Scott and Julio and knowing them and their leadership teams, it's not an expectation, it's knowledge. We will not stay upside down in Consulting. We will improve the business and we will grow revenues at a faster pace than we grow expenses. So Mark, you want to take the accounting question?
Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. So at least on RevRec, I'll say a few things to this – it's a dense topic. The first thing I'd say is, this is a major implementation of the standard across the firm and all the assumptions in that implementation with the approaches we had are all performing as designed. And so, any variance that you're seeing from the pro formas to actuals this year is just – it's a reflection of underlying business performance. And if you think about the impact that standard had is the – the part of our business that was most significantly impacted was Guy Carpenter and they're up significantly year-over-year. And so, we're happy with the way our implementation is going. But just remember the directional guidance that those pro formas represent, it's really the standard applied at a high level to our 2017 results and obviously 2018 is turning a little bit better. To your direct point, we are – so if you had just used that pattern of EPS adjustments across the quarters, we are seeing year-to-date a – more lift than those pro formas would have suggested. Again, it's primarily as a result of the outperformance in Guy Carpenters. It's real performance. And I would expect to give back a little bit more. So I think the pro formas in Q4 called for $0.05 of giveback in Q4. That's likely to be $0.01 or $0.02 higher. So at this point, there's probably a modest amount of year-over-year lift but we will give back more in the fourth quarter than we had anticipated. And so, that full year-to-date benefit you're seeing, we don't expect that will be the year-to-date benefit for the full year.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: So, Elyse, I'd like to just take a moment because I've made a clear statement that we expect over time our consulting business not to be upside down. And considering I have the two leaders right in front of me, why don't I hand off to Julio to see whether he agrees with that and then we'll go to Scott. So, Julio.
Julio A. Portalatin - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks Dan. I appreciate the hand-off on this. We have certainly continued to manage our businesses with a high degree of discipline, looking for opportunities with this investment so that we can invest in other things of higher growth. Some of that is certainly on display when you think about the inorganic and organic investments that we've made over the last quarters. And to remind you of a few of course, our Mercer Marketplace 365, organic; Investment Management business, we built a terrific investment management business, delegated solutions over many years investing organically, absorbing it into the P&L, and continuing to see great results. Our colleagues has done a terrific job there. Our Mercer Pension, this exchange is really taking off. And of course on the inorganic side, some of them are notable investments, around Thomsons Online, and continuing investment in Workday and CPSG in the digital front, PayScale partnership, and of course, Pavilion, Summit, and most recently our alliance with Morningstar. All of those things, of course, are things that we are investing for – for short, medium and long-term benefit to continue to be able to drive top-line profitable growth over a long period of time.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you. Scott?
Scott McDonald - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: All I'd add Elyse is that – like the rest of the MMC businesses, we also have a strong discipline around growing revenues greater than costs over time, and we will continue to do that. We continue to see really strong growth prospects ahead, and that should be possible.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks. Thanks, guys. Elyse, anything else?
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: No, I'm all set. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Perfect. Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. We now take our next question from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Michael Zaremski - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Within Mercer, between the recent acquisitions you mentioned in the prepared remarks and organic growth trends it looks like Investment Management will eventually be a larger revenue contributor than Defined Benefit Consulting. I'd love to know if those businesses have similar margins but I doubt you want to go down that path. Maybe you can help us size up how you would view the long-term growth rate for Investment Management, maybe how we can better size up the growth which has been phenomenal there?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Thank you for that. First I want to take my hats off to our colleagues in the Investment and our Wealth business who have built a terrific business quite frankly, quarter-after-quarter continuing to outperform and be industry-leading and clients really – value proposition really resonating with client. So I sort of want to start off there, it's a business where we have been able to build a great brand in this space where we continue to invest organically and continue to invest inorganically as mentioned earlier with Pavilion, Summit, and Morningstar and we'll continue to see great strength there. From time-to-time, just like anything else you have a quarter that that does one thing or the other. But over the long term, this is business that we're pretty bullish on and we're going to continue to invest in and see great prospects for the future.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Now one other thing, just that we won't go down the path, Mike, of your margin question but broadly speaking, and I mentioned it on last quarter's call, the DB business, the Defined Benefit business is a very high margin business, which as we have said before is in a structural long-term decline based upon no new DB information. And that Mercer has done a really a wonderful job building other businesses which will ultimately replace that revenue but at this moment in time as I said last quarter, those businesses don't aggregate to the same level of margin and so you do have this headwind against you as DB is declining and the other businesses are growing, some of those businesses we expect to have similar margins in the future. Not all of those businesses, but some of them. Next question? Mike. Do you have a follow up?
Michael Zaremski - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. One quick follow up. Maybe you can quickly just touch directionally on the P&C pricing environment, Property & Casualty pricing environment? And also some insurance carriers have been talking about a pickup in claims inflation being a trend. Just curious if any of your data can see that as well? Thanks.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Well I'll have both John and Peter comment, John first. So John, the P&C environment?
John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Price changes in the quarter were pretty consistent with what we observed in the second quarter. Prices were up a little bit more than 1%, about 1.4% overall. Casualty pricing was down almost 2% largely driven by work comp pricing pressure here in the United States. Property was up about 3%, a little bit more than what we observed in the second quarter. Financial lines pricing, primarily D&O-driven, over 3% in the quarter. Roughly the same as what we observed in the second quarter so not a lot changed really in the second quarter. On a regional basis, Asia and continental Europe, rates overall were down slightly. Other regions were flat to up slightly. Australia is kind of the one outlier, where price increases are north of 10% on average and we've seen that over the course of 2018. Insurers are talking about loss cost inflation on particularly on longer tail lines. It's early to say whether we see that from our data across the board. But we are seeing some evidence of that for sure. But I would add, the industry remains very well-capitalized and with interest rates rising as well, I expect the market to continue to be stable.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks. Peter, you want to comment on the market from a reinsurance perspective?
Peter C. Hearn - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure, Dan. Thank you. Mike, if I look at it and I bifurcate the rates between loss impacted and non-loss impacted business, on loss impacted business on the property side rates are anywhere between flat and up double-digits. On non-loss impacted property business, they're negative 5% to plus 5%. On Casualty business same thing, loss impacted is anywhere between 2.5% and 5% and non-loss impacted is anywhere from negative 3% to plus 5%. And I think it's fair to say that even with $100 billion of loss last year, reinsurance rates have not moved appreciably in 2018.
Michael Zaremski - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks. Next question please, operator.
Operator: Thank you. We now like to move to Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research: Hey. Thanks. I guess my first question just trying to put 2018 in context as a margin year. So, 2016 and 2017 we actually look like – looks like we had less organic revenue growth. In 2016, it was 140 bps of margin expansion. Last year, that was 70 bps. And this year, it looks like we're running around 4 bps and we're just trying to get to some margin expansion and there's a restructuring going on. So, I'm just trying to understand like is 4% kind of the new bogey in terms of being able to expand margins going forward or is there something special from an investment standpoint that's just made it more challenging this year?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. So, I would start by saying that we're focused more on earnings growth than anything else. And if I look at earnings growth for the year, NOI year-to-date within RIS is up about 10%. Consulting is having an off year for reasons that we had talked about before. I don't believe 4% is a new bogey and is replacing 3% because our expenses on a continuum are not growing at any faster pace than they were growing over the last couple of years, so we still believe that fundamentally around 3% we should be able to expand margins when we're at that level. This is a bit of an odd year and we signaled it not just last quarter but even the quarter before that. And if you look at the second quarter of this year, RIS had a really tough comp since the expense growth was zero in the second quarter of 2017, and we always knew that the third quarter was going to be an issue for Consulting since Mercer made an adjustment to its variable comp pool in the third quarter of last year, which resulted in them being down minus 2% in expense growth and obviously that was a really tough expense comparison and that explains virtually all of the drops in the third quarter of 2018 as it relates to the Consulting division. So, in this room we're all looking forward to the fourth quarter and we're all looking forward to 2019.
Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research: Got it, understood. And then just a quick follow-up for Mark. The pension credit year-to-date, any – I think that was flat with last year. Any indication of what that's going to be in 2019 relative to this year?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Mark, you want to take that?
Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Ryan, it's too early to tell. Really, whether it comes to cash funding or the expense or credit looking forward, those things really depend on our year-end valuation and that's part of what we're doing now. So, we would typically comment on that in our fourth quarter call early next year.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. But it's fair to say that over the last several years we have materially de-risked pension as a P&L type of issue for the company. The next question please.
Operator: Thank you. We take our next question from Meyer Shields of KBW. Please go ahead.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks. I think you've touched on this, but I wanted to dig in a little bit more. Given the overall, I guess, U.S. employment situation, should we expect a higher drift upward in salary and benefits expense excluding major acquisitions in 2019?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: I mean, we watch – obviously, in a consulting brokerage firm, compensation and benefit is the largest cost of operating the business. And so, we watch it. We're a good payer, and we believe that we attract and retain very high quality colleagues. And so, we look at – across not only our industry but other industries in terms of attracting people in. So, our goal is not necessarily to drive our comp and then (00:48:35) as a percentage of revenue ratios lower. But having said that, we watch them very carefully, and when we look at a rolling 12-months basis over the last couple of years, it's relatively consistent. It's certainly – if anything, it's slightly lower than higher. So, we don't feel any inflation pressure on – with regard to higher levels of employment in the U.S. driving higher costs for us. I think the reality is, Meyer, for the last several years the unemployment rate in the U.S. for skilled positions in the areas in which we operate was zero. And so, from that standpoint, this situation has existed for a long period of time. Now, on the positive front, higher levels of employment creates – should create higher levels of business confidence, higher levels of payroll, higher levels of exposure units on things like workers' comp and casualty but that – time will tell on that as we move forward.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. No, that's helpful and yeah, hard to get, worst impact than zero. Mark, you touched on the FX impact overall in the quarter. Was there any observable impact on the individual segment margins from foreign currency?
Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: No. The impact on margins wasn't terribly significant.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks. Sure. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Meredith of UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Yes. Thank you. A couple of quick questions here for you. First one, I'm wondering. Is there any way you can quantify what the benefit to kind of the expenses are in the RIS from the restructuring program that's going on or margins, what kind of benefits you're seeing?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I mean at the end, it's mild. As we said, on the call when we talked about the restructuring the first time, we weren't going to quantify the number of bottom line savings. We believe some of the restructuring will drop to the bottom line that would probably be more impactful next year than this year. The other thing would be we are going to be reinvesting some of the savings in areas that we believe we can accelerate in digitization, data and analytics where we've been investing as we go. And in fact, obviously, it's a margin headwind as we build capabilities in those areas. We're not really getting much revenue in those areas now but we are certainly picking up the expense. But ultimately, we believe, revenue will come from that. And as we've done in the past – we've said in the past, we're sort of a pay-as-you go investment company. We've had pretty consistent CapEx over a number of years. We don't build up levels of investment, but where we see an opportunity and between digital analytics, AI, ML, RPAs, there's a lot going on in the world and we've got to participate. We've got to take some risks, we've got to innovate, some of that cost money, and we want to free up some money to do that without overly impacting our expense rates. And that's one of the reasons why we're dropping some of the restructuring into reinvestment as opposed to alter the bottom line.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Makes sense, makes sense. And then just quickly, a question on JLT. Of the cost saves these guys anticipate at (52:24) $250 million, does that include or anticipate any type of retention packages you're going to have to have for kind of key producers and executives?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I mean, there's a couple of things. One, I never believe you can buy people's loyalty. People work for a company, when they're highly skilled they have choices. They can work in a lot of different firms. We want them to choose the combined company, we want on both sides, Marsh & McLennan people and JLT people. And so we have to create the environment as a combined leadership team that essentially fuses the culture and preserves and celebrates those parts of JLT's culture, which are different from Marsh & McLennan and makes them so unique and special. And I think that's the single most important factor. Now, having said that, within our deal model they are on a go forward basis. We're certainly going to develop some level of appropriate retention mechanism for a select group of very key individuals but it will not be widely applied.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Next question.
Operator: I'll now turn back to Mr. Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.

Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies' Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Second quarter 2008 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They're available on the company's website at www.mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion on those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. During the Q&A session, please limit your questions to one and one follow up. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Please go ahead.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Dan Farrell of Investor Relations. We balance investing for the long-term with delivering strong performance in the short-term. Doing this requires ongoing investment, disciplined execution and thoughtful capital allocation. Our performance will continue to reflect the compounding benefits of numerous strategic actions bearing fruit over time. Each of our businesses has a strong foundation for growth as the world continues to see accelerating change and complexity. From a macro perspective, there continues to be significant under-penetration of insurance globally, including sizable protection gaps in areas such as natural catastrophe and cyber risk. The world needs solutions in areas such as digital transformation, complexity of the health sector, retirement needs of an aging population, and the workforce of the future. We are uniquely positioned to serve clients with global capabilities around risk, strategy and people. Before discussing our results, I would like to update you on several moves we've made since last quarter, which highlight how we continue to invest for long-term revenue and earnings growth. I will also provide a brief update on the Competition and Markets Authority review of the UK investment consulting industry. In the second quarter, Mercer announced the expansion of their investment capability by acquiring a license in India. India is a market that is seeing ongoing pension reform, which we believe will drive increased third-party investment advisory services. Mercer also continues to add to its geographic region capabilities through strategic M&A. In the quarter, we completed two acquisitions in the career line of business, which adds roughly $16 million of annualized revenue. In late June, Marsh announced an agreement to acquire Houston-based Wortham Insurance, the 33rd largest agency in the U.S. with more than $130 million of revenue and 530 colleagues. This business offers a wide range of property, casualty and employee benefits products and services. Wortham, founded in 1915, is a premier broker with a culture and business mix that fits nicely with Marsh's existing retail business in Texas. The combined business will operate as Marsh Wortham and will be led by Richard Blades, the Chairman of Wortham. During the quarter, we also completed three acquisitions in Marsh & McLennan Agency adding $15 million of annual revenue. Marsh & McLennan Agency has annualized revenue of approximately $1.3 billion. As we have said previously, this is a faster underlying growth business within Marsh. With the success of building out our national presence over the last decade, we continue to see opportunity for smaller fold-in transactions in addition to the other mid-sized M&A we have executed in the past. Also in the second quarter, our UK commercial and consumer business completed an acquisition in Scotland adding approximately $15 million of revenue. We continue to see strong growth runway in the middle and small commercial areas. Further aligning with this market opportunity, in the second quarter, we announced the rebranding of our MGA business, the Schinnerer Group, to Victor. The rebranding includes Victor O. Schinnerer in the U.S. as well as our brands in Canada, the UK, Europe and Bermuda. The ICAT and Dovetail insurance platforms will be part of the Victor global business but will retain their current names. Combining our extensive underwriting, analytical, capital and tech capabilities across geographies will allow for greater innovation and client service. These changes further support our strategic efforts at the consumer and smaller end of the commercial marketplace where digital capabilities will have an increasingly important role in the business. The middle and small commercial marketplace is vast and highly fragmented, and we view this area as an opportunity to leverage Marsh's scale, expertise and capabilities. Last quarter, we discussed how Marsh was implementing changes with the goal of simplifying the organization through reduced management layers and more common structures across regions and businesses. These changes align with Marsh's segmentation strategy allowing a more targeted value proposition in large-risk management, middle-market corporate, and small commercial and consumer segments. The actions being taken will likely result in total restructuring charges of $80 million to $100 million with $55 million taken this quarter. These charges are classified as noteworthy, and therefore excluded from our adjusted results. This simplification initiative will result in increased efficiencies and additional capacity for reinvestment in people and technology to drive future growth and innovation. Now, let me update you on the review conducted by the UK Competition and Markets Authority of the investment consulting marketplace. In a provisional report issued last week, the CMA did not recommend any structural changes. The CMA did recommend certain industry-wide remedies involving mandatory tendering, enhanced fee disclosure, and common standards for reporting performance. The report describes the marketplace that is not highly concentrated and states there is no evidence of conflicts of interests that give rise to a competition problem. We welcome the clarity that last week's provisional decision brings, and we look forward to continuing to work with the CMA, which plans to issue its final report in March 2019. Now, let me discuss our results for the second quarter and first half of 2018. Results were mixed in the quarter with strength in RIS offset by weaker-than-expected result in Consulting, specifically in Mercer's Defined Benefit Consulting business and Oliver Wyman's financial services practice. For the quarter, consolidated revenue was $3.7 billion, up 7%, or 6% excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. Underlying revenue growth in the quarter was 3%. Adjusted operating income grew 4% to $754 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income grew 2%, and the adjusted operating margin declined 70 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share grew 10%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted earnings per share increased 8%. For the six months, consolidated revenue grew 11% or 8% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. Underlying revenue growth was 4%, and adjusted EPS increased 11% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. In Risk and Insurance Services, second quarter revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of 9%, or 8% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. Underlying revenue growth was a strong 5% in both Marsh and Guy Carpenter in the quarter. Marsh U.S./Canada underlying growth of 8% was the highest quarter of growth since we began reporting the U.S./Canada division in 2008. International underlying growth was 2% in the quarter with Asia-Pacific up 6% and Latin America up 3%. We also saw a return to growth in EMEA, which was up 1%. Adjusted operating income of $532 million increased 9%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income grew 6% with the adjusted operating margin declining 50 basis points in the quarter. As we discussed last quarter, RIS margins were impacted by a tough comparison on the expense side. For the six months, revenue was $4.4 billion, an increase of 14% or 9% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. Underlying revenue growth was 4% for the first half of the year. We are pleased with the first half performance in RIS. In the second quarter, Consulting revenue was $1.7 billion, up 4% both including and excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. Underlying revenue growth was 1% for the quarter with 2% growth in Mercer partially offset by a 2% decline in Oliver Wyman. Adjusted operating income was $267 million, decline 5%. Adjusted operating margin declined 140 basis point. In the quarter, we saw a further decline in Mercer's Defined Benefit Consulting business, mainly due to softness in project-related work in the U.S. and UK and lower new business wins in the UK versus last year. DB Consulting is a solid margin business within Consulting, and the decline in the quarter did have a meaningful impact on earnings and margin. As we've said previously, the DB market is not a growth area. We may have periods of positive growth, but DB is on a mid to longer-term declining trend. DB is an important part of our overall wealth business. The DB business provides a sizable pool of assets which helps drive growth in investments and defined contribution. While underlying growth in Defined Benefit Consulting was down 6% in the quarter, the investments business grew 12% producing 1% growth in wealth overall. When we look at the first six months on an underlying revenue basis, Mercer is up 3% with health up 4%, career up 6%, and overall wealth up 2%. Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue declined 2% in the quarter. Despite solid growth across most lines of business, we saw a decline in our U.S. financial services practice. This is primarily due to reduced volume of regulatory-related work for financial institutions. Based on our outlook today, we expect Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth for the second half of the year to be essentially flat with some variability among the quarters. In the aggregate, our results for the first half of 2018 met our expectations. For the full year, we expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion and strong adjusted EPS growth. With that, let me turn it over to Mark.
Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Dan, and good morning. In the second quarter, we delivered 3% underlying revenue growth highlighted by strong underlying growth of 5% in both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Overall revenue was up 7%, or 6% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, ASC 606. For the first six months of the year, underlying revenue growth was a solid 4%. Operating income in the quarter was $691 million, while adjusted operating income increased 4% to $754 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income increased 2%. Overall, our adjusted operating margin declined by 70 basis points excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. GAAP EPS rose 8% to $1.04. Adjusted EPS increased 10% to $1.10. Excluding a $0.02 per share benefit from adopting the new revenue standard, adjusted EPS grew 8%. For the first six months of 2018, our GAAP EPS has risen 16% while our adjusted EPS has increased 19% to $2.47. Excluding a $0.16 per share benefit from adopting the new revenue standard, year-to-date adjusted EPS is up 11%. We continue to believe the new revenue standard will be neutral to earnings for the full year. In Risk and Insurance Services, second quarter revenue was $2.1 billion with underlying growth of 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 9% to $532 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income grew 6%, and adjusted margin declined by 50 basis points. For the first six months of the year, revenue was $4.4 billion with underlying growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income for the first half of the year was up 20%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income increased 9% with adjusted operating margin flat year-over-year at 26.7%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.7 billion with strong underlying growth of 5%. For the first six months, revenue at Marsh was $3.4 billion with underlying growth of 3%. U.S. and Canada underlying growth was 6% while international was up 1%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $332 million in the quarter with underlying growth of 5%. This is the sixth quarter in a row of 4% or higher underlying growth for Guy Carpenter. For the first six months of the year, revenue was $1 billion with 6% underlying revenue growth. Strong year-to-date growth is benefiting from solid new business and strong retention in all major business lines. In the Consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was $1.7 billion with underlying growth of 1%. Operating income increased 1% to $267 million and adjusted operating income decreased 5%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, the adjusted margin declined by 140 basis points. As Dan mentioned, earnings and margins were impacted by softness in Mercer's DB Consulting business and Oliver Wyman's financial services practice in the U.S. Consulting's underlying revenue growth for the first six months of 2018 was 3% with consolidated revenue of $3.3 billion. Adjusted operating income for the first half of the year was up 1%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income increased 2%. Mercer's revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter with underlying growth of 2%. Wealth grew 1% on an underlying basis. Within wealth, Investment Management & Related Services increased 12%, while Defined Benefit Consulting & Administration declined 6%. Our delegated asset management business continues to show strong growth with assets under delegated management of $242 billion at quarter-end. Health increased 1% on an underlying basis in the quarter. Recall though last quarter's 7% growth benefited from favorable timing that came at the expense of the second quarter. For the first six months, health's underlying growth was a solid 4%. Career underlying growth continues to be strong and was 7% in the quarter. For the first six months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $2.3 billion with 3% underlying revenue growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue was $492 million in the quarter with an underlying decline of 2% primarily due to a reduction in regulatory project works in U.S. financial services. For the first six months of the year, revenue was $1 billion with 2% underlying revenue growth. Adjusted corporate expense was $45 million in the quarter. As we noted last quarter, we expect the consolidated margin will be down in the third quarter due to a tough expense comparison in Consulting and up in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect margin expansion and strong EPS growth for the full-year 2018. Turning to investment income, on an adjusted basis, we had $2 million of investment income in the quarter and we continue to expect the contribution from investment income in the remaining quarters of 2018 will be immaterial. On a GAAP basis, investment income was $28 million in the quarter and this includes mark-to-market adjustments required by the recent change in accounting for certain equity investments. In this quarter, we saw meaningful benefit from these mark-to-market adjustments while last quarter they were negative. Because we do not view the volatility caused by these adjustments as reflective of our underlying performance, we have excluded them from our adjusted results and shown them as a noteworthy item. Foreign exchange in the quarter was an immaterial positive to overall NOI. Assuming exchange rates remain at current level, we expect FX to be a slight headwind to NOI for the remainder of the year. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was 25.2% compared with 28.6% in the second quarter last year. Our adjusted tax rate included a net benefit of $6 million from discrete items. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 26%. Accounting for equity awards had no impact on the second quarter following a $0.04 per share benefit in the first quarter. And we do not expect any material benefit for the remainder of the year. This is substantially lower than the $0.15 benefit we saw in 2017. Through the first half of the year, our adjusted tax rate was 24.3% compared with 25.9% last year. For the remainder of the year, we expect our effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, will be at the high end of our guidance range of 25% to 26%. This is consistent with the underlying effective tax rate we have seen through the first six months of the year. As we said last quarter, the U.S. tax reform legislation is new and there is a possibility that there will be further guidance from the U.S. Treasury and others on the interpretation or application of the new rules. This could result in adjustments to our estimates as we move through the year. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $6.3 billion, essentially unchanged from the end of March. Our next scheduled debt repayment would be in October 2018, when we have $250 million of notes maturing. In the second quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares of our stock for $250 million. Through six months, the company has repurchased 6.1 million shares for $500 million. This quarter marks the 25th consecutive quarter we have repurchased shares. And since announcing the commitment to reduce our annual share count in March 2014, shares outstanding have declined by 44 million or 8%. Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $1 billion. Uses of cash in the second quarter totaled $592 million and included $250 million for share repurchases, $194 million for dividends, and $148 million for acquisitions. For the first six months, uses of cash totaled $1.1 billion and included $500 million for share repurchases, $383 million for dividends, and $257 million for acquisition. In May, our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.375 to $0.415 per share, an increase of 11%. For the full-year 2018, we continue to expect to deploy at least as much capital as the $2.5 billion we deployed in 2017 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. We are delivering on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividends per share by double-digits. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Mark. Operator, we're ready to begin the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question comes from Ryan Tunis, Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I guess just thinking about on the Consulting side, it sounds like you're a little bit surprised with what happened with Oliver Wyman. Does that change in any way, I guess, your four-year margin outlook? Are we still right to think though that Oliver Wyman doesn't have quite as much of an impact one way or another on margins? From quarter-to-quarter, I think, that used to be the at least guidance you gave.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Ryan. That's true. What we've said in the past is that Oliver Wyman should actually outgrow the aggregate of the other three operating companies over time but with more volatility and that it's more revenue related than earnings related, although it does have an impact on earnings. In good times, we get more earnings; and in rougher times, we don't. It's important to note that Oliver Lyman's five-year CAGR on an underlying basis is 6%. And so it is our strongest grower over the last five years, but there will be periods of volatility. And it's important to isolate – not only for Oliver Wyman, but for Mercer as well. Both Oliver Wyman broadly and Mercer broadly actually are doing very well year-to-date. They have specific issues in businesses, FS in the United States for Oliver Wyman and the DBA business in the U.S. and UK for Mercer. I'm not trying to understate the importance of us dealing with those issues over time, but fundamentally the broad spectrum of what each of our Consulting businesses engage in are doing quite well.
Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research: So, I guess, thinking about the full year outlook, it's still for margin expansion. It sounded like you were a little bit – these are my words, but it sounded like you're a little bit more negative about the DB administration, maybe you were – the Oliver Wyman issue. Should we read that to think that there's probably some other areas that you now feel a little bit better about from an organic revenue growth standpoint headed in the back half of the year, and if so, what areas would those be?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: I mean, I think there's plenty of things in Consulting to feel good about. As I was just saying before, the breadth of what we do in Consulting is doing quite well. In fact, I mean, I don't want to make excuses about businesses that are underperforming and we have to find ways of getting value from the DBA business and FS in the United States. Both are actually high quality, strong business with good professional colleagues, and they deliver us quality returns over time. The DB is different because, as we've mentioned before, DB is not a growth business. There is not new business in DB emanating from new DB plans or new DB formation. New business in DB is essentially project work on existing plans. And so that's going to be a declining business over time. Did it decline a bit faster in the first quarter or the first and second quarter than our expectation? First quarter was around our expectation. Second quarter was a little steeper, but that doesn't necessarily make it a trend. We'll just have to see how that goes over time. But when I look at the overall business, there's a lot for us to be excited about and that's why we clearly are saying that we're on track for another solid year. I mean, if I look through six months of this year on an overall company basis, we've grown 4% underlying. It's better than the 3% underlying that we did last year on an overall company basis. And we've done 11% adjusted EPS growth. So we are absolutely on track to deliver a good year with margin expansion for the overall company and with strong adjusted EPS growth. Next question, please?
Operator: Next question is from Kai Pan in Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you and good morning. My first question just follow-up on the DBA discussion. We have seen weak organic growth in the segment for about like, let's say, two years now. So, do you think it's a structural issue or it's a competitive issue for you guys? And do you think that when we will possibly reaching a bottom in that?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. No, it is absolutely a structural issue. This is not a cyclical issue. Defined benefit pension plans, I doubt anybody on this call has one that's open. So, these are frozen plans that are essentially in a long-term, 25-30, 35-40 year runoff basis. And so these are declining businesses but of high quality which adds value to other businesses. So, clearly, a benefit in our investment business, which, as you saw, grew 12% this quarter, is its linkage with our DBA business. But the only thing on a market competitiveness would be more along the lines of what's the mix of business and maybe the large accounts sector and certain types operates with more stability than the upper-middle market. That is to be determined over time, but the reality of the DB business is that it's on a long-term declining trend.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. I do wish I had one open one. My follow-up question is on the Marsh simplification initiatives. So, could you tell us a little bit more about what exactly you're doing? And the $80 million to $100 million like restructuring cost, how much savings we expect from it and how much will be reinvested, and how much will flow through the bottom line?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Sure. I'll now hand off to John in a second, but there are certainly going to be some efficiencies that are derived from the restructuring activity. And some of that cost savings is going to be flowing to the bottom line. We're not going to give a specific number at this stage as to what's going to flow into the bottom line. I mean, fundamentally, the world is changing pretty fast. We want to get out in front of it in areas like digitalization, et cetera. So, part of our strategy is to free up some capital so we can accelerate investment in some of these critical areas. We have a strategy of investing as we go. But that doesn't mean from time to time we don't want to drop more money in because we see more opportunity. But, John, do you want to give us a little bit more on that?
John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure, Dan. So, Kai, we continue to execute on our effort to simplify our structure. Dan mentioned earlier we'll have fewer layers or leaders will have increased spans of control. That's part of the effort. We're going to have greater consistency in how we're organized around the world. There will be increased focus on the three client segments we serves: our large risk management clients, the middle market or corporate accounts as we call it and the small commercial and consumer segment. We expect to be simpler, more agile, and we're pushing decision-making authority closer to the client. And as Dan said, the effort is also about enabling us to accelerate some investments in support of our strategy. The areas of investment are our digital capabilities, data and analytics, strengthening our middle market or corporate accounts value proposition. We're going to be adding some talent in key growth areas. And we also expect to continue to invest in our MGA operation.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you so much.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Kai. Next question, please?
Operator: It's from Elyse Greenspan in Wells Fargo.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. My first question, you guys posted pretty impressive 8% organic growth in the U.S. and Canada this quarter. I was just wondering if we could get some additional color on what drove that broken out by the U.S. as well as Canada. How significant was MMA contribution to growth, if you could also update us on the size of MMA today? And did the contingence that you accept on a portion of your business – was that a driver of the growth as well? Just any color so we could understand the pretty impressive number.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Elyse, that was a great, single, multipart question. So I hope we – if we don't cover them all, then circle back, and let us know what we've missed. But I'm going to hand off to John in a second. But obviously we're pleased with Marsh's overall growth in the quarter, and Guy Carpenter as well. So, RIS had a strong quarter, and obviously the 8%, we're pleased with as well. John will give you a little bit more color. I don't really want to, quarter-by-quarter, get into sub details of each of the segments within U.S./Canada, but we'll give you something certainly for this quarter. So, John?
John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure, Dan. So, Elyse, we were pleased with the quarter, as Dan mentioned. The growth in the U.S. and Canada was pretty strong across the board. Marsh in the U.S. had double-digit new business growth. Cyber, transaction risk, construction activity, all contributed favorably to that. Our West Coast operation had a particularly strong quarter as well. In Canada, we had an excellent quarter of growth. MMA, we had pretty consistent growth really around the country. We had a particularly strong growth quarter in benefits at MMA. So, that contributed favorably to the overall results. Contingence at MMA are not a – it's not a huge part or huge driver of our overall activity. We saw a little bit of an increase in contingent revenue in second quarter. And then the other part that I would say in the U.S. that contributed nicely to the result was our MGA operations. Dan mentioned that we organized and rebranded our MGA operations under the new name of Victor led by Chris Schaper with a particularly strong quarter in the U.S. as well. So, overall, it was a good quarter. On the international side, the results were improved over the first quarter and over the second quarter a year ago but still were more mixed. Real strong growth in Asia. Latin American and Pacific had solid quarters. We had good growth in Continental Europe and in Africa. But the UK and the Middle East remain some pressure points. Last quarter, I mentioned we have new leadership in both the Middle East and in the UK and I'm excited about – it's obviously early days but I'm excited about some of the changes they're making to improve the results. But we'll still see some pressure in the UK, particularly over the course of the rest of the year. So, it was a good quarter. As Mark mentioned, through six months, our underlying growth was 3%. Cautiously optimistic about the second half, particularly in the U.S, but again we'll see some headwinds from the UK in the second half as well. And I think MMA annualized run rate right now is around $1.3 billion.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, John.
John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: I think I got all of them.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Elyse, you have a quick follow-up?
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. My second question on margins. Last quarter, you guys had said that you expected the deterioration in the Q2 to be driven by RIS and then in the Q3 you had tougher expense comps. I'm just trying to tie that together. It does seem like Consulting margins deteriorated a bit more than you would have thought this quarter. So, is, I guess, that still the case? And for your full-year margin improvement, is that going to be driven more by RIS which seems to be running stronger? Are you still expecting margin improvement in both segments for the year?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Let me take that part first. I mean, we haven't given up on the year by any measure in either segment on a margin basis, but certainly margin expansion for the year will be driven by RIS because of its stronger top line performance and some of the dynamics within the business. Now, we see continued opportunity for operating leverage in the future in both segments. Whether it occurs this year or not, we'll just see as time goes on. As we've said before, we focus more on earnings growth. And over the long-term, earnings growth will be more of a function of what we do on the top line than anything else. And so what Mark said last quarter, just to revisit that because seasonality is a little different for us this year, was that last year was a little odd for us. We had anticipated some softer top lines. We really pulled some expense levers. And so in the second quarter of last year, RIS had 0% expense growth. And so we expected RIS's margins to be under pressure for this second quarter. The strong growth that they had really came through to absorb a lot of that as well. That actually was a bit of a hurt to RIS as well on the margin side in the second quarter. So, what we've said about the third quarter is Mercer's expense growth in the third quarter of last year was a minus 2%. So, they've got a tough expense comparison for the year. But what we're really focused on in Consulting is top line and getting better growth activity on the revenue side. And as I was saying to Ryan earlier, it's important to look underneath the hood at the full Consulting business because Mercer actually is having a very solid year year-to-date when you take out the DBA business and look at that in an isolated way as being a declining business that we have to get out in front of and manage in a different way. But if you exclude that, they're up 6% or 7% year-to-date in the other segment. And in a similar fashion, Oliver Wyman is up something like 8% year-to-date when you look at the – taking out the FS business in the United States. Now, we would never take out our DBA business or our FS business in the United States. These are two important solid businesses, but it's important to isolate them every once in a while just so you can see exactly what's going on more broadly within these divisions. Next question, please?
Operator: Next question from Larry Greenberg in Janney Montgomery Scott.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Thank you and good morning. Yeah. You just kind of touched on some of what I was going to ask about on Oliver Wyman. But can you frame for us how big the U.S. financial services business is for them on a relative scale? And then are we going back to a more normal environment in terms of regulatory-related work versus a heightened environment a year ago? Can you just give us some color on the environmental factors?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Thanks for the question, Larry, and I'll hand off to Scott in a second, but, I mean, obviously our FS business is a big business because if all the other pieces of Oliver Wyman are doing quite well, and they were negative overall, it shows the size of that business. And all you have to do is read the newspaper, and you realize many financial institutions have sort of gotten out from under the continued high scrutiny regulatory activity that's been the case over the last several years. And so yes, we may be going to a more normalized environment with other growth opportunities with financial institutions but perhaps that's changing. But, Scott, do you want to add some to that?
Scott McDonald - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Larry, I'll give you a little more color. I mean, the FS business has always been a great business for us. It's less than 40% of the overall business now, and the U.S. regulatory business is only a part of that. Overall, it's probably less than 10% of the overall Oliver Wyman business. And in Q2, what we saw the end of was really this large wave of stress testing, and recovery, and resolution planning programs that the banks have gone through. And we knew that was coming and we've been actively working to transition to other areas. Those include a number of strategic areas around growth, business evolution, culture organization, technology, digital, advanced analytics, customer experience, as well as a number of replacement risk and regulatory focus, things like cyber risk, liquidity risk, financial crimes and combat. And we're pretty optimistic about that transition. We've done that many times over the last 30 years, but it's going to take us a few quarters. And as we go through that process, I think, there will be some volatility in the results. But once we finish that, I think, we'll be back on track. We're still targeting. We're still very confident in generating mid- to high-single-digit growth for the business as a whole. So, I think there has been a structural change there but that's nothing new for us, and many times in the past we've replaced that with other business.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks. Larry, any other follow-up?
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Thank you. Yeah. Just quickly. Dan, I interpreted what you said on the Wortham acquisition as that is not part of MMA Agency. Is that correct or am I wrong on that?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: That is correct. I mean, we felt – when the team – we've been having discussions with Wortham for quite a while. We've gotten to know them very well over many years. And, culturally, they align more with Marsh than they do with Marsh & McLennan Agency. They skew a little bit higher. Although they do have some middle-market business, they skew into the upper-middle market in the large accounts space. They're very good in specialty areas like energy. They work on some big accounts. It's more of a team dynamic organizational relationships, that sort of thing. And so, we felt it was a better cultural fit. And, as you know from our acquisitions in the past, cultural fit and culture and that kind of chemistry between teams is one of the areas that we really look at and highlight and focus on. And we just felt they were a better fit for Marsh than MMA.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Great. Thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Next question, please?
Operator: Next question from Meyer Shields in KBW.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. So, Dan, one quick question on the Consulting side. Just with regard to the responsiveness of expenses to the revenue shortfall, can you talk about how that compare to your expectations?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: I mean, it's a fair question overall in terms of when you look at the expense base of the company because clearly Consulting – we, for many years, have been able to, in most quarters, grow revenue at a faster pace than expenses. That is a philosophy of our company. Clearly, it won't happen in every quarter, and obviously in this quarter, Consulting is upside down. It's tough when you have 1% growth overall not to be upside down, right, and 1% is kind of an anomaly for us in Consulting. But we look at our expenses very carefully. I mean, one of the things to consider what I think is a bright spot within the company is the notion that in a people business, comp and benefits is always our biggest driver of costs. It's always the largest portion of cost of goods sold. And so, if we look at our comp and benefits ratio as a percentage of revenue, they're basically flat across the company, which means we're doing a good job managing our comp and ben regardless of the revenue over the course of the last few quarters. And so that to me is a positive. If you look at Consulting's operating expenses, there's a lot going on, so let me unpack it a little bit because obviously you'll see some growth in their operating expenses. Both M&A and FX are fasters and both contributed to an uptick in expenses in the quarter. Another big driver was sub-adviser fees in our investment business. I mean one of the things you have to recognize is our AUDM is up more than 25% year-to-date. And so the fees we pay sub-advisers which run through our operating expenses are up materially or meaningfully. Legal fees are also up due to work that we're doing on our M&A pipeline, also some of the CMA stuff that we've done. So, my view is the challenge for Consulting in the quarter was more about revenue than about expenses. We have proven over time that we know how to run a business on the expense side and we will continue to do so.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. No. That's helpful. I really appreciate it. Second question, you touched on insurance under-penetration earlier in your prepared remarks. Can you drill down a little bit in terms of how you see the industry responding whether it's affordability or other issues to what is clearly some under-penetration?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Sure. I'll hand off to John and if Peter has anything to say about it as well. But, certainly, you can just look around the world and see indebted governments who are providing post loss catastrophe protection using taxpayer money that they may not have, right? One of the biggest buyers, not just the developed world, one of the biggest markets of under-penetration for as an example flood insurance is the United States. But, John, why don't we start with you and then we can go to Peter if Peter's got something to add. So, John?
John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. I mean, we see opportunities to develop product and distribution capabilities in small commercial segments of even mature economies as you pointed out, Dan, here in the United States. So, our acquisition of ICAT last summer was an important part of really trying to drive more nat cat type coverages into the small business environment. Torrent, of course, is another example of a business that we have that's got a great flood expertise and now administering the NFIP program as well. You talked about Victor, as well Dan earlier. Victor is largely phased off as is Dovetail with the small commercial market, and we see smaller businesses maybe bought packages around the world but now are facing cyber risks, for example, renewal risks. And so, that's an important and growing part of our business. So, it's often been talked about in emerging economies and emerging governments. But as you say even within more mature markets around the world, we see an opportunity to expand product density into some of these customer segments.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks. Peter, do you have anything to add?
Peter C. Hearn - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Meyer, if I just look at our public sector business, which we broadly define as state, federal, local, provincial, sovereign entities that are de-risking the taxpayer, as a standalone business, it'd be the sixth biggest business within Guy Carpenter. So, we're seeing strong growth in that area as there's more and more pressure on governments to de-risk the taxpayer. And we've seen it certainly in the United States. We're starting to see it in Europe as well.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: So, Meyer, the age of risk has just begun. We know what we know and that's underpenetrated. There's been a lot of risk that we don't know that are yet to come, and we will be involved. So, next question, please?
Operator: Next question from Yaron Kinar in Goldman Sachs.
Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, everybody. I want to go back a second to the DBA business. Just to maybe set my expectations. I think you're talking about a stable decline, and yet you're also saying that 1Q 2018 was probably more in line with your expectations. Even if I compare 1Q 2018's revenue decline to 2017 and 2016, it seems like the decline has accelerated. So, I just want to better understand what stable decline means from your perspective. And on top of that, are the revenues that you're replacing this lost DBA revenue with – are you able to achieve similar margins on the replaced revenues in other businesses within Consulting?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Sure. So, I'll take that a little bit, and then I'll hand off for Julio for more color. I'll say a few things. First, on the margin point, DBA is a large established business with high margins, right? So, some of the growth industries that Mercer has invested in, over time, we anticipate will have similar margins at some point in the future, but they do not do so at this moment in time. The other thing I want to say about DBA and defined benefit in general is if you look broadly the topic of retirement security is fundamental. The best retirement security products have not even been invented yet. So, it's not – completely think that this is just a downward trend forever, that there won't be other things that get developed to help solve the challenge that's a major issue globally for an aging population. And so there will be other types of approaches, and Mercer will be very involved in those kind of other approaches. But, Julio, why don't you talk a little bit about how new business is created, and the types of things that happen, and therefore sometimes if you have more project work, maybe the overall revenue suffers a year or two later, but...
Julio A. Portalatin - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Right. So, let me, if I can – thank you for that, Dan, but I'd like to just talk a little bit about the panoramic view of growth in general. So, Dan mentioned a little bit of it before. We're pretty encouraged by some of the investments we've made to drive growth, and some of them you all are very aware of whether it's in talents (50:43) online or in software associated to that, Mercer Marketplace 365, digital implementation practice, which is doing well, workforce analytics and delegated investment solutions, which we talk a lot about already. Now, the dynamics of the DB business, we've been managing quite well for a long period of time. We got great people, great consultants doing great work for our clients. That success includes creating great value for our clients, de-risking, providing advice, glide path, vendor's eye (51:12) to investment consultancy and delegated solutions. Now with that, that means that some of that work results in less programs over time, less DB programs over time due to DB plan termination and less project work that's associated with those programs. So when things happen that allow for de-risking work to take place, naturally DB programs start terminating. So, on the flip side though, it still results in some really good growth as a feeder to our investment business and other businesses. So while new business opportunities can ebb and flow, we have positioned ourselves to take advantage of opportunities that could be presented by regulatory changes, interest rate fluctuations that hopefully increase funding levels and can generate demand for de-risking over time.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yaron, any other follow-up?
Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. Just I guess to clarify before, the follow-up. So, it sounds like maybe there's just some project that's ebb and flow that's affecting the first half results or maybe causing a little more pressure than usual.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: That's correct.
Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. Okay. And then, the second question I had real quick one on the simplification initiative in RIS. Are there any cost saves that came in the second quarter?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: John?
John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Cost saves in the second quarter, no.
Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: No?
John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: No. So, much of the effort as we began to execute on and separate some talent came very late in the quarter.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. And then...
John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: No impact on the bottom line.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: And also you said simplification in RIS. It's actually a Marsh simplification as opposed to RIS.
Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Next question, please?
Operator: Next question from Dave Styblo in Jefferies.
David Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Hi, there. Good morning. Hey, Dan, when we were on the road on last time, you spoke about sort of a framework for long-term EPS growth and something if you're growing organic growth around 3%, that that's reasonable to think about a 10% EPS grower. And then as you scale that up to 4% or 5% over time, EPS growth obviously looks better than that. I'm just curious, with the strong results in U.S./Canada and that looks like EMEA is bouncing back a little bit, can you talk about some areas that gives you more confidence about being able to eventually push organic growth higher? I think UK was one of the pressure points. Can you just give us an update there since U.S./Canada seems to be doing quite well right now?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. So, a few things. I think the point that I've made before is that our long-term adjusted EPS growth over time will be more determined by the top line than margin expansion in the future. I mean, when you look back, you go back a decade ago or so, it was about margins, right? And we had to improve our margins and we did that as a firm and a lot of our adjusted EPS growth was driven off of margin. This has been the aftermath of a financial crisis. And so it has been a long, slow growth GDP environment globally. A little bit better now, but it's certainly not buoyant. And as we've said before, GDP is one of the determinants because it's a big determinant of exposure units. GDP, payrolls, et cetera. So, it's a bit better in the U.S., but the rest of the world, as an example, is not materially better than it was over the last couple of years. And so when I think about adjusted EPS growth over time, yeah, I think around a number like 3%. You're not going to be driving for mid-teens types of adjusted EPS growth. In fact, it would be counterproductive in your business to do so. And so that's essentially trying to deliver strong results whatever those turn out to be. And as we start growing 4%, 5%, 6%, that's when we can start pushing into the 12%, 13%, 14% type of adjusted EPS growth. And these are all the long stretches of time, not any one quarter, not any one year, but that's our view. I certainly believe that the company's capability of growing is better than 3% and we've been sort of in this 3% or 4% range for a while. Now, we need some other things in the world to cooperate, but ultimately we have been shifting our mix of business. We have been favoring acquisitions that are growing faster than we are. We are looking at all kinds of opportunities, for example, in RIS in the mid corporate and the small commercial place. So we have a multitude of different approaches to drive better revenue growth. And with better revenue growth, we'll have better adjusted EPS growth.
David Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Helpful. Okay. And then for my follow-up, I hate to come back to it but the DBCA business for the softness. I guess the biggest question investors want to get their arms around is could this get worse as you move into the second half and beyond? Can you – I think two of the reasons you talked about was just soft project work and then less new wins. Maybe on the back part of that, is it less new wins just because there's less going around or are you not winning as much as you historically have? And then looking back, you did start to give us a segment breakdown I think going back to 2016 where growth was flat that year. It was down 2% last year. Are you guys able to give us what the organic growth profile looked like maybe going back into 2015, 2014 and 2013 just to understand has it been this low before and does it just tend to bounce around from time to time?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I think you need to really focus on defined benefit in terms of what it actually is. At the end, defined benefit is with regard to pension plans. And if you look back into history, the further you go back in history, the more that there would be new formation of DB plans, active DB plans. That has – as you know, we've become a defined contribution world. There is not many new DB plans available. There's other activity in that area. I mean, if you look at the development within Mercer of the investment business, the investment business is far stronger than it was five years ago and certainly 10 years ago, but it has gone from strength to strength. One of the values or feeders of assets into our investment business comes out of our defined benefit engagements. But you can't think of this business in a way that says, okay, that this is going to be a growth trajectory on defined benefit consulting. That's just not a reality. And that we've been talking about that essentially for more than a decade frankly. And so this is a long – I mean, people are living longer, healthier lives than any time in human history. And so many DB plans that thought they were going to run off over 30 years may run off over 50 years. So, this is going to be a big business for us for a long period of time, but it's not necessarily going to be a growth business. When growth happens, it's based upon project work as Julio was saying before. So, I think we've dealt with DB enough. And you guys can go through a bit of research about defined benefit plans. As I was mentioning before, we are actually quite pleased with Mercer's overall performance. And even with DB underperformance or growth issues they're 3% year-to-date within Mercer. And in terms of how we feel about the next couple of quarters, we don't expect the Consulting division to be a 1% grower from here on out. We expect that it will go better than that.
David Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Sure. Okay.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: So, next question please?
David Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Thanks.
Operator: Next question from Mike Zaremski, Credit Suisse.
Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse: Hey. Thanks for fitting me in. Regarding the disclaimer on the tax rate could potentially change based on guidance, I appreciate that's a complicated bill but I was hoping maybe you could shed light on whether we should be thinking the long-term tax rate is biased higher or lower. And I guess related, there's been a number of companies – the multinational companies talk about the BEAT tax impact in outer years, and kind of curious if we should be thinking about that as well.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Thanks. Mark, you want to take that?
Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I think our estimate of the higher end of that 25% to 26% range for this year contemplates everything that we know at this point. And we've actually had six months to work through the particulars of the bill and see our geographic list of earnings and things like that. So we feel like we've got good visibility for this year. In terms of longer-term, there's so many factors that can influence our rate – tax law changes aside, that really our guidance does go year-to-year. So, I won't give you – I don't have a really good perspective on longer-term at this point. And in terms of the language, it is still very new and it is a very complicated bill. And there is the possibility that, as I said, the U.S. Treasury or others could come out with different interpretations of a very complicated bill that for global companies like us involves a lot of decisions. But as we sit here today, we feel good about the rate that we're projecting for the rest of the year. Things like BEAT – it has no impact on us this year. The targets of those types of provisions, like earnings stripping type behaviors, really was not part of our technology. And so, at this point, we think we'll be able to deal with any of the provisions that have potential to impact this year's factored into the rate guidance that I gave.
Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And one quick follow up. Dan, you mentioned, in terms of the restructuring charges, in terms of being able to accelerate investment. You mentioned increasingly going digital, and I guess it just kind of remind me of this insurtech word, which seems to be – get a huge buzz these days. From my top-down perspective, I'm honestly not sure if most of the headlines are noise, or if they're adding real value. Maybe if you can talk from Marsh's vantage point, if you can offer color on whether insurtech is something that you think is – you guys are investing and looking at, or will be a material impact over the coming years?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. We could probably spend an hour on that one. So, I'll try, in our next call, to address it a little bit more, but just very quickly. Yes, absolutely. We're very engaged with insurtech activity. We want to improve our peripheral vision. We are working in all kinds of different ways in order to do that. Yes, we periodically see something that we want to either have a partnership with or even make a small investment into. The insurance industry remains inefficient in some parts of the value chain and whether you're looking at policy issuance, claims process, et cetera. And so, there's a lot of interesting things going on in the insurtech space that may bring value to our clients. And so, yeah, we are absolutely engaged in that.
Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I just like to hand back over to the speaker today, Dan Glaser.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. And let me just finish by saying I feel really good about the business and where we are. We are on track to deliver another strong year of financial performance. We've grown 4% underlying year-to-date. Our adjusted EPS is up 11% year-to-date, and so we've got a lot to play for in the second half. I'd like to thank all of you for joining us on the call this morning. And I'd like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. Have a good day.
Operator: Thank you. And this will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies' Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. First Quarter 2018 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For more detailed discussion on those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation of these measures to most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Mindy. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Dan Farrell of Investor Relations. Before I review our results, I'd like to make some comments on the current environment. We are living in an age of disruption, but it is also an age of possibility. At Marsh & McLennan, we are well positioned to make a difference for our clients as they navigate in increasingly dynamic and complex world. Companies are facing challenges that cut across many dimensions; the global economy, geopolitical threats, environmental concerns, severe weather, cultural change and technology amongst others. All of these are significant, but the changes due to advances in technology seem to test us in different ways on a daily basis, with digital advances amplifying both the risks and the opportunities for business and society at large. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics and cloud-based platforms are creating significant potential for our clients. At the same time, this has given rise to growing risks as well as human challenges around how the workforce of the future needs to adapt to this changing environment. These newer challenges are emerging alongside many of the existing concerns for society such as demographic shifts, retirement savings, the affordability of healthcare and the insurance protection gap. Marsh & McLennan's expertise spans all of these areas and it is relevant and enduring. We provide our clients with valued content, expert advice and strategic solutions in the areas of risk, strategy and people. For example, both Marsh and Guy Carpenter are doing valuable work to improve risk modeling and better address protection gaps in the areas of flood and cyber. Mercer is engaged in meaningful work that directly addresses timely issues around the future work, healthcare affordability and access, as well as helping people achieve financial security for life. Mercer works with clients to ensure to the extent possible that technology enhances rather than replaces a company's greatest asset, their people. Oliver Wyman is continuing to expand its digital technology and analytics team which is developing digital strategies and creating new business models for clients to address major challenges through advanced analytics. The DTA team is currently engaged in multiple projects creating the entire digital ecosystems for companies across industries. We have a broad and unique set of capabilities that differentiates us from other professional services firms. The drive for exemplary performance is embedded in our company's culture. We are focused on our clients' needs and the solutions to help them achieve their goals. Our colleagues have consistently delivered for clients and shareholders. We recognize the critical balance of delivering for today while investing for tomorrow. While our capabilities, resources and global reach are significant, we constantly strive to get better, investing for the future and increasing operating efficiency. These efforts enhance our ability to help our clients navigate their changing risks and capitalize on growth opportunities. As I look across our businesses over the last decade, they each have undergone changes to position for the long term while at the same time consistently delivering strong results. As I noted last quarter, the macro picture seems to have stabilized and there is more confidence among CEOs around the next couple of years than there has been in the recent past. However, this optimism has not yet translated into significant changes to GDP forecasts versus a year ago. While U.S. GDP is up slightly with some likely benefit from tax reform, growth in other areas of the global economy such as the UK and Europe remain roughly unchanged impacting overall global economic growth which is still relatively low. We are also in a fast changing and volatile world. The recent debate around global trade underscores how quickly the economic and risk landscape can change. While volatility and uncertainty present challenges, they also present opportunities. As we had proven over the past decade, our businesses are well-positioned to deliver in a variety of market conditions. Let me spend a moment on current P&C pricing trends. The Marsh Global Insurance rate composite saw an increase of 1%, in line with the level experienced in the fourth quarter. Global property lines continue to show the largest degree of rate increases. Casualty rates are down about 2% while professional lines pricing increased 2% in the quarter. Turning to re-insurance, Guy Carpenter's Global Property Catastrophe Rate on Line index increased 6% for the January 1, 2018 renewals. More recently, the pricing data coming out of the April 1 renewals, which are primarily focused on Japan, was closer to flat. Although several carriers have been vocal in their expectations for rate increases, current market conditions do not seem to support any material pricing momentum from current levels absent other changes. On balance, while not providing much tailwind. The headwinds we have faced on the macro front have at least abated for now, providing us the backdrop for a good year. Now, let me turn to our first quarter performance. MMC had a good start to the year. We generated consolidated underlying revenue growth of 4% with underlying revenue growth across all four of our businesses. Consolidated revenue was $4 billion, up 14% or 10% excluding the impact of ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard. Adjusted operating income grew 24% to $918 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income grew 10% and the adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share grew 28%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted earnings per share increased 14%. In Risk & Insurance Services, first quarter revenue was $2.3 billion, an increase of 18%, or 9% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. Underlying revenue growth was 3% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in Guy Carpenter up 7%, Marsh had underlying growth of 2% against the challenging comparison of 5% in the prior-year period. Adjusted operating income of $723 million, increased 30%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income grew 11% and adjusted operating margin expanded 50 basis points in the quarter. In Consulting, first quarter revenue was $1.7 billion, up 9% or 10% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. Underlying revenue was 5% for the quarter with strong underlying contributions from both Mercer up 5% and Oliver Wyman up 6%. Adjusted operating income of $248 million rose 8%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income grew 10% and adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points in the quarter. In summary, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. For the full year, we continue to expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. With that, let me turn it over to Mark.
Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Dan and good morning. In the first quarter, we delivered strong results with underlying revenue growth across all of our businesses. Overall revenue was up 14%, or 10% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, ASC 606. On an underlying basis, which is directly comparable to the prior year, revenue grew 4%. Operating income in the quarter increased 21%, while adjusted operating income was up 24%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income increased 10% and the adjusted margin increased 10 basis points. GAAP EPS rose 23% to $1.34. Adjusted EPS increased 28% to $1.38. Excluding a $0.15 per share benefit from adopting the new revenue standard, adjusted EPS grew 14%. Before I review our results, I want to briefly mention some changes to our press release schedule. As we mentioned last quarter, we adopted the new revenue standard using a modified retrospective approach. Comparisons to 2017 will be presented by eliminating the impact of the new revenue standard from our 2018 results and comparing on that basis to 2017. This approach carries through our press release schedules and is consistent with footnote disclosures you will see in our 10-Q as required by the new standard. We believe this is the best way to assess our year-over-year performance for 2018. We've also reflected the required change in the presentation of pension expense on our income statement and have restated 2017 to be consistent with the new presentation. Finally, we've added supplemental information on operating cash flow to page 12 of our schedule. Turning to results, in Risk & Insurance Services, first quarter revenue was $2.3 billion with underlying growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income increased 30% to $723 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income grew 11% and adjusted margin expansion was 50 basis points. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.7 billion with underlying growth of 2% against the tough comparison of 5% growth in the first quarter of last year. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 3%. In the International division, underlying revenue was flat with Latin America up 6%, Asia Pacific up 4% and EMEA down 2%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $637 million in the quarter. Underlying growth was 7% with roughly equal contributions from new business and rate increases driving the growth. This is the fifth sequential quarter of 4% or higher underlying growth for Guy Carpenter. In the Consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was $1.7 billion with underlying growth of 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 8% to $248 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income growth was 10% and adjusted margin expansion was 10 basis points. First quarter saw a continuation of the strong underlying revenue growth consulting experience in the fourth quarter. The Consulting segment has averaged 4% quarterly underlying growth since the first quarter of 2010. Mercer's revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter with underlying growth of 5%. Underlying growth was strong across all three businesses. Wealth was up 3% in the quarter. Within Wealth, Investment Management & Related Services increased 15%, while Defined Benefit Consulting & Administration was down 4%. Our delegated asset management business continues to show strong growth with assets under delegated management growing to $242 billion in the quarter. Asset growth was almost entirely driven by new funding. Health increased 7% in the quarter and benefited from solid retention in our core business as well as higher enrolled lives in Mercer Marketplace 365 and strong growth from Thomsons Online Benefits. Career grew 4% with strong growth in international and continued momentum and work day implementation. Oliver Wyman's revenue was $497 million in the quarter with underlying growth of 6%. Results were strong across most parts of the business including financial services, consumer, industrials, public sector, and actuarial. Adjusted corporate expense was $53 million in the quarter and included the one-time tax reform related awards to U.S. colleagues earning $55,000 or less. We expect corporate expense will be approximately $45 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. We are pleased with our strong start to the year. We delivered 10% adjusted operating income growth and 14% adjusted EPS growth excluding the impact of the new revenues standards. Revenue recognition is creating increased seasonality, but beyond the impacts of this accounting change, our own planning this year called for more variability across quarters than you would typically see in our result. Given this, we thought it would be helpful to discuss our view of the quarters for the balance of the year. While we continue to expect strong operating income growth with margin expansion for the full-year 2018, we believe consolidated margin, excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, will be down slightly in the second and third quarters and up significantly in the fourth quarter. This is due to some tough expense comparisons in the next two quarters that will have a larger impact on RIS in the second quarter and Consulting in the third quarter. Another factor impacting margin is foreign exchange. While FX had a de minimis impact on operating margins in the first quarter, we estimate it will be a headwind to margins for the remainder of this year based on current exchange rate. Looking through the quarterly variability, we expect full-year 2018 will be strong with double-digit EPS growth. Turning to investment income, on an adjusted basis, we had $7 million of investment income in the quarter, mainly from our private equity investments. However, as you will see in our GAAP income statement, we are showing no investment income in the quarter as these gains were offset by mark-to-market adjustments required by the recent change in accounting for certain equity investments. We do not view the volatility caused by these adjustments as reflective of our underlying business performance and will therefore be showing them as a noteworthy item. On an adjusted basis, we continue to expect the contribution from investment income in the remaining quarters of 2018 will be immaterial. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was 23.5%, essentially the same as last year's first quarter as the benefits of a lower U.S. tax rate were offset by a reduced discrete tax benefit from share-based compensation. In the first quarter of 2017, we recognized an $0.08 per share benefit from last year's required change in accounting for share-based compensation while in this year's first quarter, we had about a $0.04 per share benefit. We expect that most of the tax impact from equity awards will be recognized in the first quarter of each year which is when most of our equity awards vest. Excluding discrete items, our effective tax rate was 26%, in line with our 2018 guidance of 25% to 26%. As we said last quarter, the U.S. tax reform legislation is new and there is a possibility that there will be further guidance from the U.S. Treasury and others on the interpretation or application of the new rule. This can result in adjustments to our estimates as we move through the year. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $6.3 billion compared with $5.5 billion at the end of 2017. In March, we issued $600 million of 30-year senior notes at a rate of 4.2%. With this new debt, we expect that second quarter interest expense will be about $67 million. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us flexibility with modest near-term repayment obligations. Our next scheduled debt repayment will be in October of 2018 when we have $250 million of notes maturing. In the first quarter, we've repurchased 3 million shares of our stock for $250 million. This quarter marks the 24th consecutive quarter we have bought back our stock. And since announcing our commitment to reduce our annual share count in March 2014, shares outstanding have declined by 41 million or 7%. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $1.2 billion. Uses of cash in the first quarter included $250 million for share repurchases, $189 million for dividends, and $109 million for acquisitions. For the full year 2018, we continue to expect to deploy at least as much capital as the $2.5 billion we deployed in 2017 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. We expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividends per share by double digits. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Mark. Operator, we're ready to take the questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll go to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. My first question when looking at your International business within Marsh, obviously a tough comp there this quarter which you guys highlighted. Just when you think about your 3% to 5% organic growth outlook for the full year and you benefit from some easier comps in the next three quarters, you see the growth improving kind of sequentially as we go throughout the year or how do you envision just the growth internationally and maybe if you could just also comment about what you see within EMEA as well?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Elyse, and good morning. I'll start with it and I'll hand over to John. If you go back five, six and seven years ago, consistently, International outperformed the U.S. International has still been tremendous performer for us on the top line. The difference is that the U.S./Canada division largely recovered and now is kind of neck and neck and sometimes actually outperforms on the top line from our International division. I'm not sure we're going to get into how we think about future quarters and what can happen because the world is so dynamic. But John, you want to add some to Elyse's question?
John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Good morning, Elyse. Maybe I'll talk about growth overall and then drill down a bit on International. Overall, we grew 6% in the quarter when you include the impact of M&A. And as Mark and Dan both mentioned, the underlying growth rate for Marsh was 2% in the quarter, and though I expect stronger growth for Marsh, we did have a strong start to the year in 2017. U.S. did have a solid start to the year pretty much across the board. We also had a strong growth in Canada during the first quarter. In the International divisions, results were mixed around the world. The UK had a challenging start to the year. The economy there and London market challenges persisted for us and brought down the overall growth rate of EMEA and our International operation. Continental Europe, on the other hand, had a solid start to the year. As you know, the first quarter there is quite important to the full year results on the continent. And Asia Pac and Latin America continued to perform well in the quarter. You may have also noted that we've recently announced some changes to our international leadership team. Chris Lay is a Marsh veteran, will assume the leadership of our UK and Ireland operations subject to regulatory approval. Chris most recently had been leading our operations in Canada, where we have had a nice turnaround of various leadership over the course of the last couple of years. Sarah Robson is going to step in and assume the leadership of our operations in Canada for Chris. Then we also added Christos Adamantiadis on to the team. He's going to join us next week and lead our operations in the Middle East and Africa, which has also been a soft spot for us over the course of the last year or so. Christos was most recently the CEO of the Oman Insurance Company, and prior to that, he was a long-time vet in AIG's international insurance operations. So, I'm excited about those changes. They strengthen our leadership team as we look forward.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, John. Elyse, anything else?
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yes. In terms of Consulting, I know – try not to get fixated on one quarter but the margin expansion was about 10 basis points if we exclude the impact of rev rec. You guys printed a pretty strong 5% organic. So, just I would have expected maybe the margin expansion would have been a little bit higher this quarter. Can you just comment anything beneath the numbers and, I guess, some quarterly variability you pointed out in the back three quarters, but just how you see the margin expansion for that business just on an overall basis going forward?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Sure. And as you know, we've expanded margins in Consulting quite considerably over a number of years. As we said before, margin expansion for us is an outcome of our discipline to grow revenue in excess of expense over long periods of time. It's not going to happen every quarter. And in the first quarter, as you mentioned, Consulting was good on growth but light on margin expansion and we would take the trade-off of near-term margin impact to position us for future growth much as we've been doing over the last couple of years. And we do that all while we deliver strong operating income growth. So, in Mercer last year, we highlighted investments in areas such as Thomsons and Mercer Marketplace 365. These are growth areas, but they still represent some margin headwind as the scale continues to build in those businesses. In OW, we've been making investments in people and digital capabilities. We've also had a couple of small acquisitions that have a moderate negative impact on margin. But in our belief they improve our capabilities over the longer term. So, I just want to emphasize that we will continue to invest for growth and some of those actions periodically will have an impact on margin. Our focus is on growing operating earnings. Consulting grew NOI by 10% in the quarter, and they've averaged 10% NOI growth over the last five years. And so, that's where our primary focus is as opposed to margin. Next question please.
Operator: We'll go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, and good morning. So, your 3% to 4% like a 4% overall organic growth right in the middle of the fairway of your full-year guidance, but there are some bright spots I want to touch upon, and can you provide more detail about Guy Carpenter like a pretty strong 7% growth, as well in Mercer, Health seems like increase a lot, like 7%, can you provide more detail on this?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Absolutely. So, first, we are pleased with the top line in the first quarter. I mean, clearly, we like Marsh growing more, but bearing in mind that they grew 5% in the first quarter last year. But the other three of our operating businesses all grew better in the first quarter of 2018 than in 2017, Guy Carpenter, 7% versus a 4%; Mercer 5% versus a 3%; and OW 6% versus a 4%. So, to us it's a good top line start to the year. But, Peter, why don't we talk about Guy Carpenter first?
Peter Hearn - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah, Dan. We're very pleased with Guy Carpenter's performance in the first quarter. As you said, it's 7% underlying growth in Q1 over a strong comparable of 4% in Q1 2017. The Q1 growth benefited from a combination of continued strong new business growth, as well as from the overall rate environment. And we continue to have strong pipelines with new business opportunities throughout the year.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Peter. Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you. Mercer had a solid performance across all lines of business and geographies. It was good to see that our underlying growth came in at 5%, consistent results in our faster growth businesses around Wealth. I know that you want to mention Health, but let me just go over a little bit about some of the other things that happened as well this quarter. We had some good growth in Wealth, as expected, in our Investment Management business up 15%. And as Mark mentioned earlier, our assets under delegated management now have around $242 billion. In Career, we also had strong client demand for our surveys and our Workday implementation offerings. In Health, which was specific to your question, we had solid increases in client retention, higher bookings and higher enrolled lives in Mercer Marketplace 365. Thomsons Online Darwin technology applying to our Health global benefits consultancy business, also had some really good results in the quarter. We expect that these investments that we made will continue to help us with growth. But as always there's seasonality in that growth and a little bit of the commissions that we had in the quarter may have been a little bit forwarded into the quarter from other quarters. So, you might see a leveling off of that growth rate as these quarters continue.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Anything else?
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. My follow-up question is on the expense side. Their report about their streamlining operations in Marsh and also you're looking at overall operating model. So, just wonder, is there any opportunity for further margin expansion there?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: There's opportunity for margin expansion in both of our segments, and I think we'll capture that over a number of years. We're always seeking ways to improve our speed and become more efficient as an organization and we tend to invest as we go and improve as we go. But periodically, there will be opportunities to make some structural improvement. Now, John and his team have been digging in to make Marsh more agile. It's not a huge change and it's not going to be a tremendously large cost for a company the size of Marsh. So I don't think we're going to talk much about it, but John can you add a little to it.
John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Sure, Dan. We have recently begun an effort to simplify our organizational structure. The result of that will be fewer layers of management and our leaders on average will increase their spans of control. We're going to have greater consistency across our regional operations around how we're structured as well with more focus on the three client segments that we serve. Those three segments have been our large risk management clients, the middle market, or as we describe them at corporate accounts, and then the small commercial and consumer segments. We'll be more focused on those segments looking forward. We're also moving some decision making closer to the client as part of this process. All of this will enable us to move more quickly be more agile, as Dan mentioned which we think is very important to our clients in this environment. And we expect an improved client experience as a result of that, and we look forward to updating you on our effort with greater detail next quarter.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks. Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on your comments on P&C insurance pricing. We've now heard Chubb and Travelers say on their earnings call that pricing has accelerated and they saw an acceleration month-by-month during the quarter. I just want to get your thoughts. Do you agree with that assessment and what's your outlook going forward?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Well, we're talking about relatively low numbers and I'll hand off to John to give it some more depth. But these are very low-single digits in both directions. And so from that standpoint, it's not – it doesn't seem to be that there's a significant amount of momentum. And there are some structural reasons why carriers have higher levels of growth rates than what we would show, but John, you want to get into that a little bit?
John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Sarah, overall, I would characterize the market as stable. We saw rate change – an increase in rates just under 1% in the quarter, which was actually slightly less than what we observed in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we did observe a month to month uptick in pricing. We did not see that in the first quarter on our portfolio. Casualty pricing was down nearly 2% in the first quarter really driven by work comp where prices are under some pressure. Property was up just under 3% and the fourth quarter rates were up nearly 4%. Of course, in cat exposed property with HIM losses are – those accounts are experiencing more significant increases. FINPRO pricing, financial lines pricing was up almost 2% in the quarter which was up a bunch – or up compared to relatively flat result in the fourth quarter. In our regional view, U.S., Asia, Europe, Lat, all fairly flat or even down slightly. Australia pricing is probably the one exception where prices are up in the high-single to even low- to double digits by products. So markets remain competitive which as we discussed in October as what we expected. As Dan said, the numbers from insurers are can be a bit different to point out and I mentioned this last quarter as well, I think insurers typically don't include new business in their rate. It's renewal pricing change. Obviously some of our businesses – some of our business changes hands and that typically is happening at a cheaper price. I'd also say, not every insurer is the same, right, and the outcome for each insurer isn't the same. Insurers that have a lead position, for example, on important lines of business are typically able to drive greater rate change than maybe some falling markets that are more capacity players in certain product lines, so. But again, overall, things remain fairly competitive.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, John. Sarah, I just want to re-emphasize, so what John was saying about the structural differences between how a broker looks at rates versus how a carrier, let's say a carrier loses 20% of their business to its competition. Well, a lot of that is because the competitor is offering lower terms, right. Well, they're not counting that 20% of lost business in the ongoing rate change that they're seeing in their portfolio. And so, in some ways, they're only looking at the good guys. Whereas when we're looking at is we're seeing both business that trades hands and lower prices between carriers. So, that may be one reason for the difference. But, next question? You have a follow-up?
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes. Yeah. If I could have one follow-up.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Just on the UK market review, I guess, we feel like we've heard a little less complaining from the insurance companies about the brokers lately and just want to see if there was any developments on that front.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I mean, first of all, it's still in ongoing review. So, we're not going to comment in any great depth. As we said before, insurance companies and brokers have a love-hate relationship and we've been complaining to each other pretty equally over the last 50 years. So, I don't think much has changed. The softer the market the higher levels of complaints about brokers; and the harder the market the more brokers are complaining about carriers and their lack of supply. So, ultimately, I think, this is kind of business as usual in terms of activity between brokers and insurance companies. Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Arash Soleimani with KBW.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Just to start, I just wanted to ask with the MMA, are you seeing any change in the competitive landscape there post-tax reform?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: I'll take it and I'll hand off to John if there's any follow-up. But no, we're not seeing any change. But bear in mind we're not – we don't view ourselves as a competitor to PE. So the changes in tax reform that have maybe a more significant impact on PE returns really don't impact us. Our primary competitor is whether an agency is staying private or not. We generally don't participate in auctions and we virtually never compete against PE for one of the companies in the MMA space. But, John, do you have anything to add to that?
John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: We've earned a reputation of being a good buyer that leads to some really terrific conversation. So, we remain quite active in the market, obviously we're looking for high-quality assets that are good cultural fit and they're growth oriented. And it's typically in the middle market or the SME segment not exclusively. But we're quite active in conversations not just in the United States, but all around the world.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks. Any other question, Arash?
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Yeah. Just one other quick one, you mentioned the Japan renewals at April 1 being flat. Looking ahead to June 1, do you see -because you had a lot of loss impacted business renewing there, do you see some maybe upward momentum in rates there or do you think we could see further rate erosion?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: That's primarily a reinsurance question. So, I'll hand it over to Peter.
Peter Hearn - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Arash, obviously, we don't have enough data points yet to determine what's going to happen in Florida. But if I use one-one as a guide, I think that you'll see very much of a customized approach where those accounts that have sustained loss will probably have a drive toward rate increase and those that don't, I'd imagine with the abundance of capital that's in the market, prices will remain flat.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Peter.
Peter Hearn - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: It's too early to talk...
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks very much.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Next question, please.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure.
Operator: We'll go to Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.
Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: A little bit of a follow-up on the M&A, I just want to ask sort of more broadly about any updated thoughts on acquisitions for Marsh, not just in the agency business, but broadly and just trying to figure out in our own models just what kind of revenue impact that might have prospectively.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. As we said before, we don't have a budget around acquisitions, although we are active. We have lots of conversation, as John was saying. We are definitely viewed as not only a top-tier company, a blue-chip company, but also a fair acquirer. We do what we say and we don't like renegotiate after the closing. We actually follow through with the team. And we believe, fundamentally, the chemistry and the quality of people on the other side are the most important factor. The economics, we can figure out if there's a meeting of the minds between both parties. And so, our philosophy is that we have no budget or timetable. Quality is the number one thing that we focus on. We prefer companies growing faster and that are trading below our multiple and where we have really good chemistry. And, actually, we seek acquisitions that will improve MMC broader, deeper, better, in terms of capabilities or segmentation. And I'm happy to say both in the RIS segment, particularly Marsh. And in the Consulting segment, we see a number of opportunities. It's a rich pipeline, but that doesn't mean we'll be closing a lot of deals. We also are a meticulous acquirer. We dig in deeply and we really want to understand the business and so we don't do many deals, but the ones that we do work, and as you've seen over the last number of years, I think since January 1 of 2009, we've done more than 130 transactions. And so from that standpoint, we're an active acquirer. When we look right now at where we are, the last couple of years, we've been spending about $1 billion a year in terms of value – of transaction value. That's as good, I guess, as any but there will be some years where it might only be a couple of hundred million dollars because for one reason or another it doesn't come together. So, we favor share – we favor acquisitions over share repurchase, but we favor share repurchase over building significant amounts of additional cash on our balance sheet. So from that standpoint, I would look at us as being we will commit that capital, it'll either be via acquisition or share repurchase in most circumstances.
Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: If we're watching the share repurchase amount quarter to quarter, is that an indication directly of how you see the pipeline for acquisitions?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: No. Not really. But Mark, do you have anything to add to that?
Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Paul, over the last couple of quarters, you've seen a little bit of uptick but I wouldn't read anything into that. I mean, as Dan said, ultimately where we land in that balance between repurchase and acquisition will be more driven by M&A. As you noticed or probably noticed in the first quarter, we're off to a light start. We did do five transactions but they were relatively small, but our pipeline is good. And so, our hope would be as we move through the year M&A activity will pick up. But as Dan said, we've repurchased a substantial amount of stock over the last couple years and we have that minimum commitment that I referenced, but our expectation is that we would do more than that with the ultimate mix really being determined by the level of M&A activity.
Operator: We'll go next to Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.
Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse: Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Dan, one of the – in the prepared remarks, you talked about a number of kind of corporate concerns and you didn't mention cyber security. I know the cyber insurance gets a lot of air time. And we know there's probably not as much broking capacity today as there will be down the road. But I was curious about the fast growing cyber security consulting side of the equation. Is that an area Marsh is able to assist clients and capitalize on?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Absolutely. I mean, at the end, we start with Risk, right, and Insurance whether it's regular P&C insurance or more specifically cyber insurance is an outcome and is a partial solution. But we really help clients evaluate risk on a broader basis and cyber is no different than that. So, it's about identification and mitigation, avoidance and also risk management in cyber and then it's about what kind of risk transfer makes sense. And so, I would say all four of our operating companies is involved in cyber on one basis or another. In regard to the retail clientele of corporations, obviously, we've got significant capability on the Consulting side within Marsh, but also transactional capability. But don't forget about Oliver Wyman. Oliver Wyman has significant evaluation capability within cyber, and those are growing businesses for us overall. I'd like to point out that we believe that there will be spurred growth over the next several years in the EU as a result of GDPR, which we think it'll be a big driver because there's mandatory breach notification. And cyber insurance is some element of mitigant around the risk. And so, we do believe the pickup levels because, to-date, if we look back over the last several years, I'd say, the last few years, 90% of the cyber premium in the world has been the United States. It ain't 90% of the cyber-attacks. And so, from that standpoint – the other point that I would just want to make because it's some issues that we were tackling when we were all in Davos, is that the threat is not only to data, I mean, the vectors of attack are changing and we see the possibility of physical assets, as well as bodily injury and loss of life. So, this is not just a property issue and a business interruption issue, this is also potentially a casualty issue as well. But do you have a follow-up question, Mike?
Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse: Yeah. One follow-up, the Investment Management & Related growth picked up again, and I was just curious, is there a tie-in to the appreciation of the capital markets because the markets, as you guys note, didn't increase in 1Q, but organic did increase. So, just kind of maybe some color on what's going on there.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Thanks. Julio, you want to take that?
Julio A. Portalatin - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you. Demand for our Investment Management delegated solutions business continues to be strong. The trajectory is strong. We're continuing to fund the assets that we have sold through – on behalf of our clients on a fund-to-fund basis. We have a double-digit growth. We now have over $240 billion, as I mentioned, assets under delegated management. We're really proud of the work that we're doing both in our investment consultancy and our DB actuaries because the DB business helps us. Helps us form that continuum for our clients as they think about how they match assets and liabilities. And so, we continue to see success there. Most of our success in the first quarter was actually new funding that came from client wins that we had over the months prior to. As you know, we don't want to sit here and depend on market performance we can't control that. So, what we do depend on is strong pipelines, strong conversion, great value proposition, and ultimately good results.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks. Next question please, operator.
Operator: We'll go next time to Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.
Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, everybody. Just want to follow-up on pricing. You'd mentioned that there are some structural differences between how you calculate pricing and the way that the carriers do. I guess, one thing I wanted to get a better understanding of was when you look at pricing do you try to adjust for changing terms and conditions, whether it's changing deductibles, attachment points, exclusions, et cetera. And do carriers do that as well by the best of your understanding?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: It's a good question and I remember my days of a carrier and that's one of the – those loosey areas that certain carriers do a lot of adjusting based upon terms and conditions or deductible change. And that's where some gaming may take place here and there where deductible goes from $100,000 to $500,000 and somebody gives a 15% credit as a result. And somebody else might give no credit because it's a catastrophe type of exposure. But, John, you want to take that?
John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: We do attempt to adjust for certain changes in terms and conditions, so deductible or attachment point certainly being one of them, we do adjust for that where we can see direct correlation between certain exposure elements to pricing, we'll do that as well. But as Dan noted, it could account for some of the differences as well. We don't know the increased limit factors, for example, that an insurer would use as opposed to kind of how we see it. So, I'm sure that could account for some of the difference as well.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: I think the thing to really focus on is nobody is saying this is the hard market. There's no carrier out there saying that and there's certainly no broker saying that. I mean, this is still a market that has abundant capacity that has many, many capital providers, and where the supply of capital exceeds the demand for that capital. That will always put some level of downward pressure on terms. Now, losses are the great equalizers. So let's look over into the future and we'll see where the market is depending on the level of losses born by the market. And that will be the principle determinant. You have a follow-up question, Yaron?
Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. I do. And maybe just to close on this for a second. So not necessarily that the carriers are seeing a different set of data than you and some of your broker peers are when you see rates may be flat to slightly down and there is still talk about momentum, it may just be interpretation of that data that's driving that, right?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. But it's also...
Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: ...people are generally looking at their own data.
Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Not purchased data, not market data. And so different portfolios have different characteristics and different brokers skew to either larger accounts or mid-size accounts or smaller accounts. And the carriers have different levels of specialization and lines of business. And so that's where you're getting these differences.
Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then the second question I had, I think is a quick one. On the FX headwind that you highlighted is that mostly due to the UK business where you're generating dollar revenues against the pound expenses or are there other drivers there?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: So, Mark, why don't you talk about FX in the quarter but also give some element of FX for the year as well.
Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I will broaden a bit, but the direct answer to your question, you hit on it. It's really the pound, the effect of the pound for the balance of the year. The first quarter given Marsh's renewal book, the euro is really what drove the result and so we saw the lift in revenue, but as I said no impact on margin. Because of this natural hedge that we tend to have because of U.S. dollar placements in London that you mentioned and significant to the pound for the balance of the year will have really no impact on earnings but still see, expect to see a lift in revenue and therefore you get that headwind on the margins.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks. Next question, please.
Operator: And we'll go next to Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. Just quickly, following up on that, was there an impact on earnings in the quarter from FX, I know you said they're de minimis on margins?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. So, we would be in line, because there is no margin impact, we'd expect it would be in line with what we saw in revenue.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: The lift you saw in revenue? Great. Thanks. And then my second question, I'm just curious on the organic revenue growth at Guy Carpenter, was there any of that growth that would call it one-time in nature of like capital market transactions. I know there was a lot of cap on issuance in the quarter.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Well, as John and Julio and my ex-boss used to say, it's only one time if you don't do it again. So, cat bond has – cat bonds are individual but we are in a cat bond business and the ILS business, so we would expect to see activity quarter-after-quarter in that. But, Peter, you want to take that?
Peter Hearn - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we had two cat bonds in the quarter, Brian, and last year we did 11, the year before that, we did 9. It's been pretty consistent our involvement in the alternative capital space and particularly in the ILS part.
Operator: We'll go next to Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.
Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research: Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the Consulting side. Looking at the OpEx line, I know you mentioned that expense has been somewhat elevated. But it looks like the past couple of quarters it's been running call it $50 million to $70 million higher than the level that it kind of had been averaging. I guess I'm just trying to understand how long should we expect that magnitude of investment to persist? Thanks.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I think there is a couple of things, one, if you look at the seasonality question that Mark was alluding to in his script, I mean, some of that plays out over the last couple of years. I wouldn't say that there is significantly higher level of investment in Consulting than there has been in the past. We tend to try to marry up revenue growth with expense growth. And so, what you'll see if you go quarter-by-quarter over the last several years is in quarters where we have higher revenue growth, you see higher expense growth. And so, it's not surprising that in a quarter where we have good top line in both Oliver Wyman and Mercer, we have some expense lift associated with it partly because a lot of our variable comp is driven by the top line in terms of how we fund the variable comp. We're looking at top line and bottom line effects on that. But in terms of underneath your question a little bit, and I want to talk a little bit about the seasonality that we alluded to for the second and third quarters, if you look at the expense growth for – well, first, if you go back to this year – this time last year, the first quarter of 2017, we stated in our scripts that we expected some weakness in the top line as we looked forward over the second and third quarter at that point in time. And so, therefore, we started taking expense actions to run the place pretty tight in our anticipation of a shorter top line. And if you look at Marsh as an example as expense growth in the second quarter of last year was a 1% level and then the third quarter on Mercer was minus 2%. And so, in some ways, in our second and third quarter in 2018, we're going to get back to a normal expense pattern. And so, therefore, you're going to see some expense lift just in the basis of the comparisons versus the year before.
Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research: Okay. That's helpful. Yeah. Just one more, I guess, on – and I guess, thinking about EMEA organic, you've done a couple different size acquisitions, I think, in the UK, Bluefin, Jelf. And I think we've crossed over to a point where those are now in the organic number. I'm just curious, one way or another, are those deals having kind of directionally the same impact on organic as what we're seeing for the entire segment or is there a different story going on in terms of what you're seeing in the UK on those deals that you've completed? Thanks.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: So, both Jelf and Bluefin and the combination of Jelf and Bluefin are performing as we expected on organic. Now to be fair, we want to see more organic from Jelf and Bluefin in the future but those acquisitions are not the cause of the weakness in the UK or in EMEA. I think it's more of a phenomena of the economy in the UK as well as the competitiveness and aggressiveness in the London market in specialty and in wholesale and so we're seeing some deep downdrafts on some business in those areas.
Operator: We'll go next to Adam Klauber with William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Did the economy helped the U.S. brokerage business more this year than last year?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. It's one of those things. We're talking about generally low levels of GDP growth in the U.S. It is mildly better. I think exposure units will be a benefit to our growth as we go forward. But you have to look at the mix of business, the competitive environment between brokers, but it is fair to say exposure unit as shown in values, in shipments, in payrolls are trending mildly up from where they've been. But there's not any dramatic change economic benefit or lift in 2018 versus 2017. It's kind of business as usual.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay.
John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: The only thing I would add Dan...
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah, just one, John...
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: The only thing I would add that our clients are also trying to grind out earnings growth in a low growth world as well and so they're structuring their programs accordingly, right. So we're working with them to try to match their costs.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Then also in Europe, are you seeing any difference or is it pretty flat from an economic standpoint?
John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: No, I think it's fairly flat there as well.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Thanks. Operator, I think we're coming to the end of the call. If we have one more question we would take it, otherwise I would – so, where are we, Mindy?
Operator: I will turn it back to Dan Glaser for any additional or closing remarks.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Well, thank you to everybody for joining us on the call today. I'd like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Marsh & McLennan Companies' Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's Web site at www.mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion on those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC Web site. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. I'll now turn this call over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Daniel Glaser: Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Dan Farrell of Investor Relations. I recently returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos which I have attended for the last nine years. This is the first time I left Davos more optimistic than when I arrived. Several economic factors indicate that the world may finally be emerging from the long slow growth aftermath of the financial crisis. And in my conversations with other CEOs, it was clear that they were more confident about the next few years than they have been in the recent past. However, looking further out, they had a lack of visibility and some anxiety about the acceleration of advances in technology, including potential exponential growth in AI, robotics and 3D printing, digitization and disruption and the implications for their companies and workforce. For the 13th consecutive year, the WEF released its annual Global Risks Report which was prepared with the support of Marsh & McLennan Companies and other partners. Some of this year’s concerns with likely probability included extreme weather events, natural catastrophes, cyber attacks, data fraud and the failure of climate change adaptation and mitigation. The global issues discussed at Davos are a reminder of the uniqueness of MMC and the value we bring to our clients. And I came away from this year’s meeting confident that Marsh & McLennan is well positioned. Beyond our involvement in the Global Risks Report, we held many prominent sessions and gatherings on key topics. Highlights included Mercer's When Women Thrive session which for the second year in a row was a highly attended event. Another well received session was Oliver Wyman’s Annual State of Financial Services Lunch which addressed how FS companies can learn from technology firms. Our purpose is to be a trusted advisor in the moments that matter, critical moments of peril and of strategic opportunity bringing advice and solutions to clients in the areas of risks, strategy and people. These areas involve dealing with enduring challenges providing us a fundamental underpinning for growth and resiliency. The strength of our strategic position and consistency of our strategy are true differentiators and the execution of our balanced approach continued in 2017. Over many years, we have consistently improved our mix of business and positioned the company for future growth through acquisitions and organic investments. Since 2009, we have invested nearly 9.2 billion of capital towards growth and the improvement of Marsh & McLennan. This includes 6.4 billion of capital across 143 transactions and 2.8 billion of capital expenditures. An example of our efforts to build a better company is our expansion into U.S. middle market brokerage through Marsh & McLennan agency, accounting for 62 acquisitions and nearly 2.8 billion of capital deployed. This is a faster growing area of our overall business and now accounts for about 1.2 billion of annual revenue. Recently, we have been building out our underwriting and claims capabilities in our MGA platform with the announced acquisition of ICAT in 2017 providing catastrophe capacity in the small and middle markets space. Our growing MGA business is an example where we are developing new products and services and expanding our participation in the value chain. As a reminder, our MGA platform underwrites on behalf of insurers and reinsurers and we do not take any underwriting risks. Over the last several years, Guy Carpenter has made significant investments and innovations in data and analytics as well as building out capabilities in the areas of public sector, including flood, mortgage, structured risk and cyber. Consulting growth going forward should also benefit from the significant investments we have made in both Mercer and Oliver Wyman. As representative examples, in Mercer, we have made investments in Thomsons Online Benefits and Mercer Marketplace 365 further strengthening our leading position in global health and benefits. Through acquisitions and organic expansion we have driven considerable growth in delegated asset management. We have also built a strong workday implementation practice in our career business. All of these investments enhance our position in faster growing segments within Mercer. Increasingly, clients expect digital offerings to be a core part of everything a firm does. And with that in mind, Oliver Wyman has repositioned its digital technology and analytics team or DTA to become a powerful horizontal capability supporting clients across industry sectors. Oliver Wyman now has over 400 people aligned with these capabilities. Within DTA, we continue to build out Oliver Wyman labs, which helps clients create impact from their data through advanced analytical techniques and new technology. Our recent acquisitions of LShift and Draw further expand our technical and digital design capabilities. As we have made these ongoing investments to improve our business and position for longer term growth, we have continued to deliver consistent and strong performance. Over the last five years, we have expanded revenue to 14 billion, added 10,000 colleagues, growth adjusted NOI from 1.9 billion to 3 billion, increased adjusted operating margin 560 basis points to 21.2% and delivered average annual adjusted EPS growth of 13%. Consistent execution takes discipline as investments are almost always a near-term headwind to EPS growth when compared with share repurchase. While we are striving to deliver strong financial performance in the near term, we favor mid to long-term value creation for our clients and shareholders. When I look back over the last five years, I am proud of what we have delivered for our clients, colleagues and shareholders. I am optimistic that the next five years will provide continued opportunities for Marsh & McLennan. Before moving to our results, I’d like to give you a brief update on P&C market conditions. There remains a wide range of estimates around losses from 2017 catastrophic events, but what is abundantly clear is that 2017 was a devastating year for many communities affected by these losses. According to Guy Carpenter’s estimates, 2017 is only the third time in history that annual global insured capacity losses have been over 100 billion. As we said last quarter, the market would find its own equilibrium against this backdrop of loss activity, as capital remains abundant and demand has not fundamentally changed. Guy Carpenter estimates that dedicated reinsurance capital was up 2% overall in 2017 with alternative capital up 9%, despite the sizable catastrophic losses incurred by the industry. Of the January 1st reinsurance renewals, some agreements were bound later than normal but the end results were fairly orderly with the overall Guy Carpenter Global Property Catastrophe Rate-On-Line Index up 6%. This moderate level of rate firming focus mostly on the U.S. and Caribbean, is far less volatile than the hard market years of 2001 and 2006 when the Rate-On-Line Index increased 28% and 37%, respectively. In primary lines, the Marsh Global Insurance rate composite saw a slight increase with rates up 1% on average compared to previous low-single digit declines. Global property lines showed the largest degree of rate increases while casualty and FINPRO were flat to down slightly. While we are not in a hard market, it is fair to say that the rate of change in pricing is slightly higher than it has been for the last several years. Now let’s move to our financial performance. We capped off another excellent year with a strong fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we produced underlying revenue growth of 4% on a consolidated basis, including 3% growth in RIS and 6% growth in consulting. We also delivered 18% growth in adjusted EPS driven by strong operating income growth and margin expansion in both segments as well as the benefit in the tax rate from discrete items. In terms of our full year performance, MMC had an excellent year delivering underlying revenue growth of 3% comprised of 3% growth in RIS and 4% in consulting, 70 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 15% growth in adjusted EPS. Although there is a lot of focus on underlying growth and rightfully so, acquisitions have been a consistent and an important part of our global growth story contributing to MMC’s strong 6% revenue growth in 2017. In Marsh, overall revenue grew 7% for the year with underlying growth coming in at 3%. Results were led by our U.S./Canada division which grew 9% overall with 4% underlying growth highlighted by strong performance across our U.S. businesses. Guy Carpenter had an outstanding year capped by a strong fourth quarter, producing 4% underlying growth for the full year. Mercer’s underlying growth was 2% primarily due to a falloff of project work in our DB consulting business. However, overall revenue was up 5% in Mercer as we continued to invest in acquisitions in faster growing areas. Mercer’s underlying revenue growth of 4% in the fourth quarter positions us well going into 2018. Oliver Wyman finished the year strong and delivered 7% underlying growth in 2017. Lastly, we continue to deliver on our capital commitment, double-digit increase in our dividend and annual reductions in our share count. Before I touch on our outlook, I would like to comment on U.S. tax reform. The legislation that was passed goes a long way toward leveling the playing field from a capital flexibility and tax rate perspective, not only for us but for all U.S. based multinationals that compete globally and have done so at a disadvantage. As the results of the legislation, we expect sustained benefit to our tax rate, earnings and cash flow. Looking ahead to 2018, we see the potential for a slightly better operating environment than in 2017. The macro picture seems stable if not a bit brighter. But bear in mind overall GDP growth rates across the globe are still extremely modest by historical standards. Our consolidated underlying revenue growth has grown in the range of 3% to 5% for the last eight years and this remains our expectation for 2018. In addition, we expect to expand margins in both segments and deliver strong growth in adjusted EPS. Before closing, I want to say I’m exceedingly proud of the way our people all around the world responded in critical moments last year. I would like to acknowledge and thank our nearly 65,000 colleagues for continuing to deliver for our clients, while also stepping up to support each other in our communities. With that, let me turn it over to Mark to give you more details on our fourth quarter performance.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, Dan, and good morning. Our fourth quarter performance represented a great finish to an excellent 2017. We delivered underlying revenue growth in all of our operating companies, strong adjusted operating earnings growth and adjusted operating margin expansion in both segments. Consolidated revenue increased 10% reflecting solid underlying growth of 4% and a continued contribution from acquisitions. Operating income increased 8% while adjusted operating income rose 12% to 755 million and our adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points to 20.5%. Because of the significant one-time adjustments relating from U.S. tax reform as well as other noteworthy items, our GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter declined to $0.06 per share. Adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $1.05. Looking at Risk & Insurance Services, fourth quarter revenue grew 9% to 2 billion and was up 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 12% to 473 million and the adjusted margin expanded 60 basis points to 24.1%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter rose 9% to 1.7 billion increasing 3% on an underlying basis. In the U.S./Canada division, underlying growth was 4% for both the quarter and the full year. This represents the best full year underlying growth for U.S./Canada in a decade. In the quarter, the international division had underlying growth of 1% with Latin America up 9%, Asia Pacific up 5% and EMEA down 3%.  Guy Carpenter's revenue was 239 million, an increase of 7% on an underlying basis representing a strong finish to an outstanding year for Guy Carpenter. Growth in the quarter benefitted from reinstatement revenue and backup cover activity resulting from the significant catastrophe losses in the third and fourth quarters. In the consulting segment, revenue increased 10% to 1.7 billion with underlying revenue up 6%. Resulting adjusted operating income increased 10% to 330 million. The adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 19%. Mercer’s revenue increased 9% in the quarter to 1.2 billion with underlying growth of 4%. Wealth increased 4% on an underlying basis. Within Wealth, Investment Management & Related Services increased 12% while Defined Benefit Consulting & Administration increased 1%. Assets under delegated management continued to grow and at quarter end were 227 billion. Health revenue grew 3% on an underlying basis in the fourth quarter reflecting improved retention and a rebound in project work. Career grew 6% on an underlying basis with continued strong growth in our survey business and workday offerings. Oliver Wyman grew revenue 12% in the fourth quarter to 546 million, underlying growth of 9%. Results were driven by widespread growth across the portfolio, particularly in consumer, industrial and services sectors. Before I continue with the discussion of our results, I want to talk about two new accounting standards we will be adopting in the first quarter of 2018. The first and most significant is the new revenue accounting standard ASC 606. This new standard will have a meaningful effect on the seasonality of our revenue and earnings with revenue and profitability shifting to the first and second quarters from the third and fourth quarters. While revenue and profitability will be accelerated across quarters, there should be no material change to our full year results. For us, the largest impact on revenue will be in Guy Carpenter where we will see an acceleration of revenue across most of our 3D business. Revenue will shift from the third and fourth quarters to the first and second with the first quarter seeing the bulk of the lift. In Marsh on certain fee business, we will move to recognition and placements as opposed to a more proportional performance-based approach. This will result in revenue shifting out of the first quarter and into the subsequent quarters, but not enough to offset the acceleration in revenue in Guy Carpenter. In Mercer and Oliver Wyman, we don’t expect any significant impact on revenue. The standard also requires that we capitalize and amortize certain costs associated with obtaining new clients and fulfilling our contractual obligation. For as today, we largely expense these costs as they are incurred. These changes will affect both segments. For the company, the net of all of this is that we expect an overall lift in revenue and NOI in the first quarter and a more modest lift in the second quarter and decreases in the third and fourth quarters. As I mentioned, we don’t expect a material change on a full year basis. We will adopt this new standard using the modified retrospective approach which means we will not restate prior years and quarters but rather we will reflect the change prospectively starting in 2018. As required under this approach, when we report results in 2018, we will also be providing our 2018 numbers on the old basis of accounting, so investors can clearly see the impact of the accounting change and gauge our underlying operating performance. We recognize that the transition to this new accounting presents a challenge in projecting our quarterly results for 2018. In order to help you better assess the potential impact on 2018, we intend to share a recap 2017 revenues and expenses by segment as well as overall adjusted operating income and EPS for each quarter and the full year according to the new standard. We plan to provide this unaudited non-GAAP pro forma information to you through an 8-K filing by the end of March. The information we furnish will be our best estimate what 2017 results would have looked like had we applied ASC 606 last year. In addition to the new revenue standard, we will also be adopting another new accounting standard relating to the presentation of defined benefit pension costs in our income statement. Previously, all components of defined benefit pension costs were combined and reflected as a net amount in compensation and benefits. Starting on January 1st, only the service cost component will be presented in compensation and benefits. All other elements of defined benefit pension costs will move into a separate line item below operating income. Given that our plans are recently well funded, these other pension components have been a credit or an expense offset within the overall pension expense amount. Therefore, this change in income statement presentation will result in a decrease in operating income. It is important to recognize that this is a change in presentation only and that all of the major elements of pension expense have always been disclosed in our financial statements. This change has no impact on our EPS, net income or cash flow. Under the standard when we report our 2018 financial results, we are required to restate prior years. In order to assist you in understanding this change and to provide a basis for modeling going forward, we have included restated segment operating income and consolidated income statement information for 2016 and 2017 on Page 13 of our supplemental schedule. Also for modeling purposes, we would suggest using the amount of this credit in 2017 as a reasonable basis for estimating this line item in 2018. Now back to our results. As we typically do on our fourth quarter calls, I’d like to update you on our global retirement plan. 2017 was another active year in further reducing our exposure to defined benefit pension risks and volatility. We closed our defined benefit pension plan in Canada, our third largest plan and undertook a voluntary cash-out program in our U.S. plan. These actions combined with the closures of our UK, U.S., Ireland and other DB plans over the last few years have significantly reduced our exposure to interest rate volatility and long-term pension risks. Cash contribution to our global defined benefit plans were 314 million in 2017, including a $50 million discretionary contribution to our U.S. plan in the fourth quarter. Given the improvement in funded status of our global plans in 2017, we expect cash contributions to drop to roughly 100 million in 2018. One final item to note on pension. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a $54 million charge resulting from distribution elections made by participants in our UK pension plan. This charge is reflected as a noteworthy item and not included in our adjusted results. Investment income was 12 million in the fourth quarter, a majority of which was due to a gain on a sale of an investment. For full year 2017, investment income was 50 million compared with less than 1 million in 2016. For 2018, we expect only modest investment income. Our adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter was 23.4% compared with 25.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter adjusted tax rate reflect a number of discrete items, the most significant of which was the impact of the accounting change related to share-based compensation. For the full year, our rate benefit is significantly from this accounting change with the total benefit to EPS amounting to approximately $0.15 per share. Given some tax driven planning with accelerated option exercises from 2018 into the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as the lower tax rate in the U.S., we currently project substantially less tax benefit from this item in 2018. For the full year 2017, our adjusted tax rate was 25.4% compared with 28% in 2016. Let’s spend a minute on U.S. tax reform. Overall, we are pleased with the tax reform legislation. We will benefit from the more competitive tax rate in the U.S. and the leveling of the playing field due to the new territorial system. While the legislation on the whole is a long-term positive for MMC, it did result in a couple of one-time charges. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a non-cash charge of 220 million to reduce the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, we recognize the U.S. tax liability of 240 million on previously untaxed foreign earnings. This deemed repatriation tax liability will be paid in equal installments over eight years. Given the nature of these adjustments, both are reflected as noteworthy items and therefore excluded from our adjusted results. Based on the current environment and taking into account our estimate of how we will benefit from the U.S. tax reform, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2018. When we give forward guidance on our tax rate, we do not project discrete items which can be positive or negative. In addition, our tax rate is sensitive to other factors such as changes in the geographic mix of our earnings. This U.S. tax reform legislation is very new and there is a possibility that as we move through the year, there will be further guidance from the U.S. treasury and others on interpretation or application of the new rule. This could result in adjustments to our revenue. Corporate debt at year-end 2017 was 5.5 billion. As we have said in the past as part of our capital deployment plans, we will likely increase our debt balance each year in line with any debt capacity we create through earnings growth. Accordingly, we would expect to be active in the debt market during 2018 although the exact amount and timing of an issuance is uncertain. Obviously, our current run rate of interest expense will change depending on the amount and timing of any new debt. Our next scheduled debt repayment is in October 2018 when 250 million of senior notes will mature. Cash on our balance sheet at year end was 1.2 billion. As planned in 2017, we deployed 2.5 billion of capital across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. Uses of cash in the fourth quarter totaled 535 million and included 300 million for share repurchases, 195 million for dividends and 40 million for acquisitions. For as full year, our uses of cash totaled 2.5 billion and included 900 million for share repurchases, 740 million for dividends and 872 million for acquisitions. For 2018, we expect another year of significant capital deployment. Based on our current outlook, we would expect to deploy at least as much as capital as we did in 2017 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. Lastly, in 2017, we delivered on our capital return commitment. We reduced our share count by 6 million shares or 1.1% and increased our dividends per share by 10%. For the full year 2017, we produced 3% underlying revenue growth, 10% adjusted operating income growth, 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 15% growth in adjusted EPS. As Dan said, for 2018, we expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion in both segments and strong growth in adjusted EPS. With that, I’m happy to turn it back to Dan.
Daniel Glaser: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we’re ready to begin the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Good morning. My first question is just on the margins that we saw in the quarter. Was there an element of – maybe you guys saw a pretty strong growth quarter accelerating some expenses, so if we could just get a little bit more color on just the expense level really in both of the segments? Because I thought in consulting that you guys had pointed to margins better in the back half than the first half of the year and it did slow down a little bit in the fourth quarter and I know you guys saw strong growth in Guy Carpenter which I thought might have driven the margins a little bit more in RIS.
Daniel Glaser: Thanks, Elyse, and good morning. As we’ve said a couple of times before, we focus on earnings of the company. And overall when I look at the quarter, we’re up 12%. When I look at the year, we’re up 10%. So we feel very good about that. You’re very right in that when we run the business, we’re seeking to grow our revenues at a faster pace than our expense certainly every year and in most cases in every quarter as well. And so this year was kind of a different year because we had a little bit less visibility on the revenue line. As we had said before, we thought that some of the project work was softer than we expected. And so we ran the business on the expense side reasonably tightly. When we got some visibility into the fourth quarter and saw that we were going to have a nice top line, we decided to do a little bit of catch up. So I wouldn’t – the way I’d look at it is over long stretches of time, either a year or rolling four quarters. There’s always things that we want to do to invest in the business both on the people side and on the technology side. And so this was just business as usual in our mind.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you. And my second question, I appreciate the commentary on the pricing environment. If you can maybe just give a little bit more color on kind of the dialogue with your clients as you talk about pushing for price, those that have losses and didn’t have losses over the past year? And then also is it possible – can we get a breakdown of your business mix between commissions and fees for both RIS and consulting?
Daniel Glaser: Okay. Well, first of all, we’re on the hindsight of the table, so we’re not pushing for price. But we’re the group pushing against price. But generally we recognize the market. We don’t set the price. We negotiate with a number of different high quality insurance companies and the market determines where prices are going. And usually as you noted that has a – it’s impacted by what was the loss activity in previous quarters and previous years. And the single biggest determinant of prices going forward is losses looking backwards. John, do you want to talk more about price and the commission and fee split?
John Doyle: Sure. Rate change continued to move upward slightly in the fourth quarter, as Dan mentioned in his prepared remarks. It’s mixed of course by product and geography, but it’s within a pretty tight range I would say. As Dan said, prices were up globally by 1%. The biggest change in the quarter on a product basis of course was in property where we saw prices up 3% in the fourth quarter driven of course by cat. Casualty pricing was down 1% in the quarter although that was a slightly lesser decline than what we observed in the third quarter. And then our financial lines pricing, what we saw was flat after being down more than 1% in the third quarter. U.S. pricing overall still down slightly in the aggregate. Australia is probably the biggest outlier where we saw the largest change where prices were up nearly 10% in the quarter. As Dan mentioned, capital remains plentiful. We’re working and focused on optimizing the right outcome for our clients. From a fee/commission split, it’s trended more towards commission as we’ve increased exposure to the middle market and grown both organically and inorganically in that segment for MMA and [indiscernible]. And I think we last mentioned here was about 60/40 a couple of years ago and it inched up a bit from that over the course of the last several years.
Daniel Glaser: Thanks. Next question please.
Operator: We’ll go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan: Thank you. Good morning. My first question is on the tax rate guidance 25% to 26%. Just want to confirm that number is inclusive of less benefits from the stock-based compensation? And also any – are you planning to spend some of the tax savings into – reinvesting back into the business?
Daniel Glaser: Okay, so I’ll make a couple of comments, Kai. Then I’ll hand over to Mark to give you some more information. But let’s just start by saying we’re really pleased that tax legislation finally passed and that – we think that this will help level the playing field, will improve U.S. competitiveness. It’s good for us but it’s good for a lot of our clients in the U.S. as well, so we might see some exposure growth, some investment as a result of it. So overall really good news. As I said before, the bulk of the tax savings will drop into earnings and improve free cash flow. However, we will make two adjustments for colleagues in the U.S. who are at the lower end of our pay scale. So there are a couple of things we’re going to do. First, all U.S. colleagues earning below $16 on an hourly basis will be increased to $16 per hour. And second, U.S. colleagues earning $55,000 or less will receive a one-time award of 1,000. And so we’ll tell our colleagues that basically right now. But we felt that we wanted to share a little bit and it’s the right thing for a people company to do. But Mark, do you want to add some more?
Mark McGivney: Kai, to your specific question on the tax rate guidance, so the outlook for next year 25% to – for this year 25% to 26%, that excludes all discrete items. So just to be clear that doesn’t include any provision for any benefit we might get from the tax accounting change last year. But as I said, we’d expect a lot less benefit this year than we got last year.
Daniel Glaser: Anything else, Kai?
Kai Pan: Just a follow-up question on margin. If you’ve looked in last five years, the average year-over-year margin – underwriting margin expansion is about 120 basis points and 2017 is a little lower at 70 basis points. I’m just wondering is that pace of improvement going to slow or you still have in addition to top line growth, but there’re potentially cost saving opportunities within the organization?
Daniel Glaser: Well, we always have both top line opportunities and efficiency opportunities. The drive for efficiency gains never ends and it’s something that the company is already actively engaged with in all segments. I’ll just take a step back for a second and say we’ve had 10 straight years of margin expansion with the last eight years being in both segments. And we’ve said many times, we don’t actively manage to expand margins. We manage the business to grow earnings and we do our best to run a proper business where revenue growth exceeds expense growth almost all the time. And so we are pleased with 70 bips of margin expansion in a year where underlying revenue growth was 3%. We think that’s a really good outcome. And it’s not ideal but we have proven over time, particularly in RIS, that we can grow margins at 3% underlying growth. We’ve done it five years in a row in RIS. Next question, please.
Kai Pan: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.
Yaron Kinar: Good morning, everybody. Dan, one thing you said actually resonated with me. You said I think – you guys said on the client side and the conversations with insurers and a lot of times pricing is actually determined by kind of where the losses have been retrospectively or backwards looking. Can you maybe help us think about the environment going into 2018 where – it seems like capital is so pretty adequate in the industry and hasn’t moved much? Haven’t really seen at least on the casualty side a whole lot of losses emerge. I think the industry is still profitable. And then you have tax reform kicking in on top of that. As you said and present to client and an insurer ask where price increases, how do you think about that? And how likely do you think these pricing increases are to fit [ph]?
Daniel Glaser: Well, there’s a couple of things and then I’ll hand over to John. But I’d start by saying – when I look at the market over the last several years, I don’t think it was a soft market driven by aggressive broker activities or clients demanding rate reductions. I think it was a market driven by many insurance companies, lots of capital and the pursuit of growth by many insurers. And so it was more about I’d say supply of capital exceeding demand than any other factor. When you look at the overall discussions that we have with clients, clients are usually pretty balanced about their carriers. They want a few deep strategic relationships with capital providers and then they sort of want some regional relationships and maybe some specialty ones. But ultimately there’s a lot less switching based upon price. Certainly in our portfolio and the more you get into the large account areas, the more that resonates. But whether the carriers can obtain pricing or not, certainly there’s many carriers that would disagree with your view, the casualty looks good at least from what they have said to us. But John, do you want to add to that?
John Doyle: Yes, I would emphasize, Dan, I think while most of our clients do take a long-term view and they don’t look at every insurer relationship the same, they are typically quite balanced about it. Having said that, while the economy has improved a bit, we’re still operating in a low growth world and so our clients are quite cost conscious in that perspective. What insurers are telling us is they’re starting to see signs of loss cost inflation pick up in certain lines of business. Financial lines for example would be – and certain other casualty classes. So as Dan mentioned, I think some of them at least are feeling some strain, certainly casualty. And obviously last year was a big cat year but the last several years were fairly modest cat losses. I think a lot of insurers also reported favorable development. So all those factors are part of a conversation that we had with our clients and again it’s – I think the lead relationships of certain insurers that have that lead position in critical lines of business with our clients, those conversations are very different than other lines. So the outcome on the insurance company side can be quite different from insurers.
Daniel Glaser: Thanks. Yaron, anything else?
Yaron Kinar: Yes, just one other question. So last year I think when you gave the 3% to 5% organic growth guidance, you had said that just given the environment it was probably going to be more on the lower end of that. This year, just given that exposure growth is improving a bit and it seems like pricing has flattened or is firming, would you be willing to venture and say that it would be on the higher end of that 3% to 5% rate or 3% to 5% is where you’re comfortable being right now?
Daniel Glaser: Yaron, I’ve been at this too long. I’m not willing to venture in any way when we’re just starting the new year and we’re one month in. So my view is that we’ve been eight years in a row 3 to 5. That captures where we’re likely to be I think right now based upon the macro factors and how we see the world. And so 3 to 5 and I’ll leave it at that.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you.
Daniel Glaser: Sure. Next question.
Operator: We’ll go next to Arash Soleimani with KBW.
Arash Soleimani: Thank you. I just had a quick question. I know you’re still seeing optimistic on margin expansion potential. I just wanted to ask, do you think from a wage inflation perspective it’s becoming a bit tougher to expand margins by as much?
Daniel Glaser: We watch our wage inflation. We’re a good payer. When I look at our comp and ben as a percentage of revenue, it’s consistent with the people business. Our people are our greatest asset by far. And so we try to stretch ourselves and support them where we can. And so when we look at wage inflation in general, we recognize the economic theory is unemployment drops, there’s probably more pressure on wages and we see that. We haven’t seen that come through yet. We do think that some of the productivity gains over the last several years for a lot of companies have a technology backbone to them and also just have a – people work longer than they used to, a backbone to it. And so clearly wages are a significant part of our – and comp and ben in general is a significant part of our cost base, but we don’t see inflation at this stage and we believe that overall we pay our people properly.
Arash Soleimani: Okay. Thanks. And then I just wanted to just double check on the pension accounting change, so a question for Mark I guess. To what extent did you say it will impact operating EPS in 2018? I know you said GAAP EPS won’t be impacted, but to what extent could it impact operating?
Daniel Glaser: Mark, why don’t you take that?
Mark McGivney: Basically it will affect adjusted EPS and GAAP EPS and you can get to the adjusted EPS in the schedule that we provided.
Arash Soleimani: Okay. Thank you.
Daniel Glaser: Thanks. Next question, please.
Operator: We’ll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb: Thank you. With regard to the comment of expectation of strong adjusted EPS growth in 2018, I just wanted to understand first is $3.92 the baseline we should be starting from in 2017?
Daniel Glaser: Mark, do you want to take that?
Mark McGivney: Yes, Jay, with the caveat. You’ll see our pro forma. We don’t expect meaningful year-over-year change in revenue recognition. And just also factor in the changes in taxes. So we had that significant benefit from the tax accounting change but of course the benefit this year from tax reform. But once you consider those factors, absolutely the results for 2017 are a good baseline for 2018.
Jay Gelb: Okay. And just a follow up on that if I’m thinking about it the right way. So if I lower the adjusted tax rate expectation for 2018 to the range you gave, that seems to be like a $0.20 benefit but taking out that net benefit credit on pension that seems to be like a $0.30 headwind. So it sounds like there would be just in the core business more earnings growth plus the benefit of share buybacks that would get you to that strong adjusted perspective, right?
Mark McGivney: Well, one thing I would point out, Jay, is remember this pension accounting change doesn’t have any impact on EPS. So that’s P&L geography above the line. So if you’re looking at adjusted EPS or GAAP EPS, I wouldn’t consider that in your – going forward.
Operator: We’ll go next to Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan.
Sarah DeWitt: Hi. Good morning. I have a question on FX. The dollar has had a big move, so how should we be thinking about the benefit of that for 2018? And can you just remind us your sensitivity to the dollar?
Daniel Glaser: Mark?
Mark McGivney: Sure, Sarah. FX wasn’t much of a story in the fourth quarter which is why I didn’t mention it. And the dollar has weakened here in the early part of this year. So as we sit here today, if the dollar doesn’t move, FX looks like it could be a bit of tailwind as we go into 2018. Obviously, there’s been a lot of volatility over the last couple of months but at least at the stage where it is, we could see some tailwind. And to get a sense for it, as you referenced, if you look back to some of our 10-K disclosure, if the dollar moves directionally against the top four currencies that we have, the pound, euro, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar, 10% moves in the dollar across those four currencies is around $50 million change in operating earnings.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Paul Newsome with Sandler O’Neill.
Paul Newsome: I want to ask whether or not some of – we might see some margin compression due to the acquisitions. Is it generally the case that you’re buying things that will have lower margins than your existing margins, and is that something we should look out for the future?
Daniel Glaser: Generally what we focus on over the last several years is acquiring companies that are growing faster than our company. And when they have a technology or digital venture to them, you’re right in that the cost for them on a multiple basis because of their high growth may be higher than an acquisition of a company that’s more traditional growing in a more traditional way. And so we saw the impact of that through this year, particularly in the first half. But really for the full year there was a bit of a drag on our overall margins because of acquisitions that we had done last year. And we expect the higher growth from those acquisitions to help us kick in and turn them positive. We’ve been investing for growth for many years. All you have to do is look at the increases in our amortization expense and you can see that we have been absorbing a reasonable amount of acquisition-type of costs as we continue to build our margins and as we build a better company. We’ve always said that we are working real hard to deliver good financial returns in the short term as we build a better company and we favor putting money to work for the mid and long term for Marsh & McLennan. We feel an obligation to do that as an executive committee. So that’s where our focus is. The other thing that we have done and Julio can add a little bit more to this, particularly within Mercer and a couple of acquisitions, we saw such an opportunity that even though they were recent acquisitions, rather than just run them as is, we started investing money into them to capture more of the growth opportunity for the future. But Julio, do you want to take that?
Julio Portalatin: Thanks, Dan. What you said is a very accurate assessment of what’s going on with our acquisitions. They continue to be – our acquisitions continue to be a very critical part of our growth strategy. And we have a strong track record over many years of being able to make very value-driven acquisitions and we will continue to do that as time goes on. Just like any other decisions that we make, we make it in the backdrop of short-term and long-term consequences we go in with our eyes wide open. That means that on occasion we make an acquisition where in the short term it could be a little tempering to short-term profits as we continue to invest [indiscernible] long-term returns. And the acquisitions mentioned that Dan was alluding to are around the whole SaaS technology model being more digitized, putting us as significant outcomes for our clients who need that type of support as they grow their digital strategies. So we want to be that partner, we want to be there and be strong with them as we look at growth and pivot to where our clients need us most.
Daniel Glaser: Thanks, Julio. Paul, anything else?
Paul Newsome: No. I just wanted to be clear because it sounds – this has been sort of a – whether you like it or not a story where it’s been a lot about margin expansion and there’s been a lot of stock buybacks. And essentially the earnings mix is shifting to more of a remnant growth from more a margin growth, that’s all I’m trying to grasp at.
Daniel Glaser: Well, I would disagree with you, Paul. I don’t think this is the margin expansion story. If you look over 10 years, this is the NOI growth story and it will continue to be an earnings story.
Paul Newsome: Fair enough. Knock on wood you’ve had some margin growth, so that’s good. Nothing to be ashamed of.
Daniel Glaser: Yes, we’ll take the margin expansion, absolutely. But we’ll focus more on earnings growth and we have been for a long time. Next question, please.
Operator: We’ll go next to Jay Cohen with Bank of America.
Jay Cohen: Thank you. A question I guess in the RIS segment is EMEA. I get a sense that the economy in Europe tends to be doing better but the organic growth there year-over-year was kind of the worst comparison we’ve seen in a long time. I’m wondering, one, what’s happening? Two, what the outlook would before that geographic region?
Daniel Glaser: It’s a good question, Jay, and I’ll hand over to John. In looking at the business in all of this moving parts and not only geographically but in the OpCos and line of business, I don’t think we’ve had a quarter yet in 10 years where everything worked in concert. So there’s usually something and clearly I know from conversations with John there’s been a lot of digging into the results in EMEA. But John, do you want to give us some more?
John Doyle: Sure, Dan. Thanks Jay for the question. We certainly were disappointed in the results in EMEA. But again, to frame it, overall, we thought it was a good growth year and strong total revenue growth both in the quarter and in the year. U.S. and Canada had a best year in quite a long time, as Mark mentioned, both in MMA and in the Marsh brokerage operations. On the international side, it was more of a mixed result. Latin America had a terrific year, Asia-Pac and particularly in Asia really an outstanding year. Continental Europe to your point actually had a solid year. The disappointment in EMEA was in the UK and in the Middle East. In the UK we had a tough prior year comp. It continues to be a challenging insurance market there and of course the macros in the UK economy are difficult at the moment. We made a big acquisition a couple of years ago with Jelf and a year ago with Bluefin. We’re quite pleased and have a long-term view and like having exposure to the middle market part of the economy there. But it’s challenging at the moment. In the Middle East, it was also a challenge. We have less project revenue in the fourth quarter, less new business overall and we’re struggling to overcome some nonrecurring business from the fourth quarter in 2016. But again, overall, I’m pleased with the growth we had for the year at 3% underlying growth and the strong total revenue growth for Marsh.
Jay Cohen: But it sounds like the headwinds will persist for a little bit in 2018?
John Doyle: Certainly the macros – I think some of the nonrecurring challenges are a bit more quarter-to-quarter. Some of our specialty operations have had more challenging results. But we certainly expect a bit more in the UK and Middle East next year.
Jay Cohen: Great. Thanks.
Daniel Glaser: Next question, please.
Operator: We’ll go next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Joshua Shanker: Yes, I guess I want to ask a question based on something Paul was getting at. If we look at the growth rate within Mercer, obviously there’s very different growth depending on the business. And over the year margin has been about flattish. If we look into the individual businesses, our margins are very different for the different businesses and is there a way of structuring Mercer for better growth over the long term by focusing on certain lines and whatnot?
Daniel Glaser: Yes, so a couple of things. One, we don’t declare margins by individual operating companies. We have two segments; consulting and RIS and we’ve shown our margins on that basis for a long period of time. There obviously are differences between the different businesses, including within the businesses, on a margin basis. But ultimately we run our businesses as segments and we declare margins on that basis. If I look at Mercer for the year, Mercer had a decent year except for the third quarter where they were zero. And so from that standpoint and I look over Mercer a number of quarters over a number of years, they’ve generally been a 3%, sometimes even a 4% type of grower. And so fundamentally there’s nothing wrong with Mercer, there’s nothing wrong with Mercer’s structure nor the structure of the company. We expect to have growth between 3% to 5% of strong EPS delivery for the year and margin expansion in both segments in 2018. So for us, it is business as usual going ahead similar to as we’ve done over the last decade.
Joshua Shanker: And if you look at bolt-ons potentially, is there more properties and opportunities on the brokerage side than there are on the consulting side or vice-versa or is it really they’re both quite fertile with a lot of opportunities?
Daniel Glaser: They’re both fertile with a lot of opportunities. The brokerage side when you see a bolt-on, you may be looking at a company that’s existed for 20 years or 25 years and they happen to be small or local. But that it’s been – it has a long history whereas on the consulting side, you see a lot more boutiques that may have been formed in the last 5 or 10 years, less of a track record of performance but maybe greater capability in an area that we might be a little short. And so we have good opportunities in the pipeline. It’s kind of a joke internally I start every year saying, oh, the pipeline doesn’t look as good as it should and every year we end up spending between 800 million and 1.2 billion or something on acquisitions which are not particularly large for a company of our size. And so this year right now we look at it and there’s plenty of things for us to engage in and we’re getting a lot of looks at things. You run a labyrinth here in terms of when we make an acquisition. We do a thorough review of the chemistry and the counterparties that we want to be as open and transparent with whatever company we’re seeking to acquire as they are with us. And so we want to make sure that it’s a good match before we tie the knot. And so we’re working that right now and will continue.
Joshua Shanker: Good luck in the new year. Thank you.
Daniel Glaser: Thank you very much.
Operator: We’ll go next to Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith: Thanks. One quick question here for you. Just on Guy Carpenter’s results in the quarter, the great organic revenue growth we had, how much of that growth was kind of one-timers, like backup covers, transaction that happened as a result of the significant event in the third quarter which did not happen in previous years?
Daniel Glaser: Well, first of all, bless you Brian for asking Mr. Hearn a question after a terrific 7% quarter and a 4% year. Peter, do you want to take that?
Peter Hearn: Thank you, Dan. Brian, yes, we certainly benefitted from reinstatements and backup coverage. That’s clear. But we’re also pleased that the balance of our growth was across all of our regions and businesses as well as a breakdown between new business and renewal businesses. Also we benefitted from growth in a lot of the initiatives that Dan talked about in his opening comments as well. So yes, there’s no doubt that reinstatement, backup coverage helped our quarter but we had a strong quarter nevertheless.
Brian Meredith: Great.
Daniel Glaser: Sorry, go ahead, Brian.
Brian Meredith: Yes, just one other quick one just thinking about outlook here, economic growth as we look going forward. Can you just remind us what is the kind of lag effect that your business has relative to when we kind of see nominal GDP rising in U.S. and UK and other areas of the world?
Daniel Glaser: Yes, I’ve never actually figured that out on a technical basis. I would just say that we do see a correlation in our businesses to GDP and to business confidence; GDP more on the RIS side, a mixture of GDP and business confidence on the consulting side. When you look at – recurring revenue tends to have an annual renewal period and so there’s a lag as an example of that that fundamentally you don’t get an immediate lift if you see exposure growth until that renewal happens and a big part of Marsh, Guy Carpenter and Mercer is recurring revenue. So from that standpoint there’s always some element of build in lag. And I was trying to make the point before that it does feel brighter on the macros but it’s still very sensitive, relatively fragile and we’re not seeing a booming level of growth anywhere. If you look at what was in the newspapers recently about global growth statistics around the world, apart from a few countries everybody was in that 1 to high 2s range and that’s just low levels of growth. So I’m not expecting a boom of exposure units, although I do think U.S. tax reform will be a benefit to many companies investing in the U.S. and also residents in the U.S. And so I look forward to the company being able to capture some of that benefit. Operator, I think we’re finished with Q&A now. So I would just like to reiterate that I’m very proud of the team. I think it was an excellent year both on the overall delivery of earnings and margin expansion, revenue growth both GAAP basis and on an organic underlying basis. So we look forward to 2018. I’d like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. So thank you very much.

Operator: Welcome to the Marsh & McLennan Companies' Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Third Quarter 2017 Financial Results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Daniel Glaser: Thank you, Elaine. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Dan Farrell of Investor Relations. Since the beginning of the third quarter we have seen a heightened level of natural and man-made catastrophe losses, including major hurricanes and typhoons, earthquakes, wildfires, senseless acts of violence and disclosures of large scale cyber events. Before we get into our third quarter results, I want to take a moment to discuss how we have been supporting our clients and colleagues, the potential market impact of these events, and the critical role that our industry plays in society. While the insurance industry has the capital strength and structural resilience to absorb these losses, the human toll has been [sobering] with significant injury and loss of life across these events. Many other individuals have been impacted through loss of homes, basic services and business interruption. The natural catastrophes of this quarter directly impacted roughly 4000 of our colleagues across over 50 of our offices. While we are very fortunate that all of our colleagues in these affected areas are safe and accounted for, there were some who tragically lost family members and our deepest sympathies go out to them. Catastrophes that occur in a different geographic region can seem remote and distance unless we are directly impacted as individuals. This is not the case at Marsh & McLennan. We understand the devastation and the stress that severe losses put on people and organizations. We are on the ground helping our clients recover as soon as possible. This includes working closely with insurance companies to process claims swiftly. In these difficult times the industry pulls together to support our mutual clients. We are reminded that our industry is a noble one. While the market impact of the recent catastrophe losses is yet to be fully determined, it is important to recognize the industry had record levels of capital and capacity leading into these events. Although the losses are significant, the impact may prove to be more of an earnings event for the industry than a capital event requiring a reloading of capital. However after several years of relatively benign activity the series of recent losses are a stark reminder of the potential loss exposures, which may cause some re-evaluation of coverage, limits and risk tolerances. While there could be some movement in pricing in catastrophe exposed areas and certain lines of coverage, the degree and sustainability of any changes remains uncertain. From our vantage point too much is unknown about how losses will ultimately develop, how capital will react or how client buying patterns will change. Ultimately these forces will play out and the market will find its equilibrium. Right now it is just too early to tell. Insurance is about more than just protection. Industry research shows that well-insured catastrophe events end up having a shorter term impact on economic growth. In contrast, events with less insurance coverage result in a more prolonged and in some cases permanent impact to economic growth of an affected region. Recent losses serve as a reminder of how the world is still relatively underinsured in many areas. For instance, U.S. risk such as flood, cyber and earthquake to name a few still have low insurance penetration relative to exposure and together account for just 2% of total U.S. premiums. Many factors contribute to global underinsurance or what is often referred to in the industry as the protection gap. They include cost and affordability, understanding and acknowledgement of risks and a lack of sufficient incentives to mitigate risk and improve insurability. It will take the combined effort of carriers, brokers and governments working together to address underinsurance in the world and better access industry risk-taking capacity. Nations and regions that have proactively addressed this protection gap are better positioned to respond and rebuild from natural catastrophes. In specific regard to flood, recent events further highlight the need for greater insurance protection and the importance for the private marketplace to play a greater role. There have been over 100,000 national flood insurance programs or NFIP claims related to Harvey and Irma. However, many of those affected lack appropriate flood coverage, and will now face these life-changing events without adequate insurance support, making the economic impact of these events meaningfully larger. A recent article looking at FEMA data stated only about 17% of homeowners affected by Harvey have flood insurance policy. And across the U.S. only 12% of homeowners buy flood insurance according to the insurance information institute. The industry should work to encourage the private market to take on more of the underinsured or uninsured flood risk. The insurance industry can improve the understanding of risk, promote loss prevention modifications and bring more coverage into the private market obviously at appropriate pricing. At Marsh, Guy Carpenter, and Oliver Wyman we are utilizing data and analytics to enhance modeling and increase private market participation in floods. Earlier this year, Guy Carpenter helped place $1 billion of private reinsurance coverage for the NFIP. And in December of this year, Marsh’s flood platform, Torrent Technologies, is scheduled to come online as the direct service provider to the NFIP. We believe there will be opportunities for the private market to take on increased roles and we look forward to working with government and carrier partners in these ongoing efforts. Also this quarter, Marsh’s Schinnerer Group announced the acquisition of International Catastrophe Insurance Managers or ICAT, a managing general agent providing property catastrophe insurance to small businesses and homeowners across the U.S.. ICAT’s focus on property catastrophe complements Schinnerer’s existing services and solutions for small and middle market commercial and residential clients. ICAT’s claims and third-party administration capabilities will also provide enhanced services to our clients. The need for greater insurance protection is not limited to natural catastrophes, recent headlines related to cyber events underscore the greater need for protection in this area and we have seen continued strong growth in demand for cyber CAT programs from large global firms and cyber coverage more broadly. The vast majority of cyber premiums relate to U.S. companies. The European General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR will go into effect in May of 2018, likely resulting in expanding demand for coverage in the EU where premium volume is low compared to the U.S. Before turning to our results, I would like to give a brief update on the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s investigation into the aviation insurance and reinsurance sector. In early October, we received a notice from the competition authorities in Brussels that the European commission has commenced a civil investigation of a number of insurance brokers including Marsh regarding the aviation insurance and reinsurance broking sector. In light of the actions taken by the European commission, the FCA informed us at the same time that it has discontinued its aviation investigation under UK competition law. We are cooperating with the European commission and taking the matter seriously. As this investigation is at an early stage we do not intend to comment further at this time. Now to our results. Overall we produced consolidated top line growth of 7% and underlying revenue growth of 3%. Operating income was up 4% while adjusted operating income increased 11%. EPS was $0.76, and adjusted EPS rose 14% to $0.79. And on a consolidated basis, our adjusted margin improved 70 basis points. Through the first nine months, reported revenue growth was 5%, underlying revenue growth was 3%, and the consolidated adjusted margin expanded 70 basis points. EPS for the nine-month period grew 11% on a gap basis, and 13% on an adjusted basis.  Looking at risk and insurance services, third-quarter revenue was $1.8 billion with reported growth of 8% and underlying revenue growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income increased 12% to $337 million with the margin expanding 60 basis point to 19.1%. For the nine-month period, RIS has grown revenue by 6% on a reported basis, while underlying revenue grew 3% similar to the full-year growth rates in 2015 and 2016. Adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion rose 10% and the adjusted margin also improved 90 basis points to 26%.  In the consulting segment third quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, increasing 5% on a reported basis and 2% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 7% in the quarter to $330 million. The margin of 20.8% was up 40 basis points versus the prior year. For the nine-month period, consulting has grown revenue by 4% on a reported basis, while underlying revenue grew 3%. Adjusted operating income of $873 million rose 5%, and the adjusted margin increased10 basis points to 18.6%. In summary, we are pleased with the results for the first nine months of the year. For the full year 2017 we continue to expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion across both operating segments and strong growth and adjusted EPS.  With that, let me turn it over to Mark.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, Dan, and good morning. Our third-quarter results were solid. Consolidated revenue increased 7%, 3% on an underlying basis. Operating income in the quarter increased 4%, while adjusted operating income was up 11% to $624 million. Adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 18.7%. GAAP EPS rose 4% to $0.76 and adjusted EPS increased 14% to $0.79. Looking at Risk & Insurance Services, third quarter revenue was $1.8 billion, reflecting growth of 8%, 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 12% to $337 million, with our margin expanding 60 basis points to 19.1%. For the first nine months of the year, revenue was $5.7 billion with growth of 6% with 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year increased 10% to $1.5 billion with a margin of 26%, up 90 basis points. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.5 billion, an increase of 9%, with a strong contribution from acquisition activity. On an underlying basis, Marsh’s revenue increased 3% in the third quarter. In U.S. and Canada, underlying revenue growth was 3% in both the third quarter and the first nine months. In the international division, underlying growth was 2% in the quarter. Latin America was up 9%, Asia-Pacific grew 7% and EMEA was down 2%. For the first nine months, international underlying revenue growth was 3% with 7% growth in both Latin America and Asia-Pacific and 1% growth in EMEA.  Guy Carpenter's revenue was $270 million, an increase of 4% on an underlying basis driven by strong growth in the U.S.. Underlying revenue growth in the first nine months was also 4%. In the Consulting segment, revenue of $1.6 billion was up 5%, 2% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $330 million, and the adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points to 20.8%. As we discussed on our second quarter call, foreign exchange and acquisitions had a dampening effect on first half earnings and margins in consulting. As we expected, these headwinds lessened in the third quarter, and we continue to expect margin expansion and solid earnings growth in consulting for the full year 2017. Mercer's revenue increased 4% in the quarter to $1.1 billion, also reflecting strong contribution from acquisition. On an underlying basis growth was flat. Overall wealth declined 1% on an underlying basis in the quarter. Within Wealth, Investment Management & Related Services increased 10%, while Defined Benefit Consulting & Administration declined 5% largely due to lower project-based revenue. Assets under delegated management at quarter end were $213 billion, increasing 12% from the end of the second quarter. Health revenue was flat on an underlying basis in the third quarter, primarily due to softness in the U.S.. And career grew 2% with continued strong growth in our survey business and our workday offerings partly offset by a slowdown in project based consulting. Oliver Wyman's revenue increased 8% in the quarter to $438 million. Underlying revenue growth was 7%, led by strong growth in the Middle East and Asia. Moving to investment income, we had a loss of $2 million in the third quarter compared with less than $1 million of income in the third quarter of last year. The impact of foreign exchange on adjusted operating income in the quarter was a slight positive. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels we expect a modest positive impact in the fourth quarter, which would bring us to a slight positive for the full year. Our adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 26.6%, compared with 28.7% in the third quarter of last year reflecting discrete items, including the impact of the required change in accounting for equity awards. Through the first nine months, our adjusted tax rate was 26.1%, compared with 28.8% last year. We continue to expect a 29% tax rate for the remainder of 2017 excluding any impact from discrete items. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $5.5 billion compared with $5.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, mainly reflecting lower short-term debt at quarter-end.  The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us flexibility, with modest near-term repayment obligation. Our next scheduled debt repayment is not until the fourth quarter of 2018, when we have $250 million of notes maturing. In the [second quarter], we repurchased 2.6 million shares of our stock for $200 million. Through nine months, we repurchased 8 million shares for $600 million. The third quarter marks the 22nd consecutive quarter we have bought back our stock. Since March 2014 when we announced our commitment to reduce our annual share count, shares outstanding have declined by 38 million or 7%. Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was approximately $1.1 billion, with $154 million in the U.S. Uses of cash in the third quarter totaled $703 million and included $200 million for share repurchases, $194 million for dividends, $309 million for acquisitions. For the first nine months, uses of cash totaled approximately $2 billion and included $600 million for share repurchases, $545 million for dividends, and $832 million for acquisitions. For the full year 2017, we continue to expect to deploy capital in line with the level in 2016 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. Year-to-date we produced 3% underlying revenue growth, 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, and 13% adjusted EPS growth. As Dan said, for the full year, we continue to expect underlying growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion in both segments and strong growth in adjusted EPS. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.
Daniel Glaser: Thanks, Mark. Okay Elaine, we're ready to go to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse.
Ryan Tunis: Hi, thanks. Good morning. So, I guess just following up on Dan’s comments in his prepared remarks, it sounded like, I think you said this may just be an earnings event for the industry and that might not have as great of an impact on price, I guess one question is, is there a view at Marsh about – I guess what the ultimate loss might be from all of these CATs because one of the debates going around is, is it a 120 billion or is it more like a $50 billion or $60 billion event you kind of infer from some of the announcements?
Daniel Glaser: Thanks Ryan. There is a couple of things. Let me just start, and then I think I will hand over to Peter rather than John to give you a view as to the overall market and level of losses, and I can say it is going to take some time to determine the aggregate level of loss per claim and how it is ultimately distributed amongst insurance companies and also other capital providers. What is clear so far is that the announced losses thus far are far short of the estimates provided by the modeling firms. I mean that – and that is not that different from some other catastrophes that have occurred in the past. It is just too early to tell what the ultimate losses will be. Having said that, catastrophe losses tend to get larger over time rather than smaller, but Peter do you have more to add to that?
Peter Hearn: Yes, Dan. I think Ryan, if we look at what has been – to your question, what has been reported to date is about 30 billion, and if you add FEMA into it, and you add another 20 billion on top of that for unreported to date, there is still a delta between that and what the modeled loss of 100 billion that has been thrown around. So these are long-duration complex losses, and they take a long time to settle out. We tend to get a number set in our mind, and as Dan said, property losses have a toll on them, not as long as casualty losses, but they have a toll on them, and these will develop. And over time, I would imagine that delta will reduce.
Ryan Tunis: Yes. Just on the 4% organic in Guy Carpenter, and I guess thinking about what the normalized growth is there? Is there any way you can quantify – how you think that might have been augmented this quarter from I guess any [indiscernible] purchasing or anything like that that might have happened associated with the storms? Thanks.
Daniel Glaser: I mean a couple of things. I will hand it off to Peter in a second, but bear in mind over a long stretch of time, Guy Carpenter has been a good grower for us, and in fact, has grown underlying revenue 26 of the past 27 quarters, and we have got three consecutive quarters at 4%. It is hard to talk about what normal is, I mean, at the end it is a very segmented, specialized business, which will have its ups and downs, but certainly for us the last three quarters have been at 4%. But Peter?
Peter Hearn: Thank you Dan. I mean, Ryan, revenue from reinstatement covers as a result of Harvey, Irma and Maria didn't have a meaningful impact on our Q3 results.
Daniel Glaser: Thanks Peter. Next question please.
Operator: And our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, good morning. My first question, I just was hoping maybe to get a little bit more color on the pricing environment to stand to some of your comments that kicked off the call, I guess. Maybe this is both a primary and a reentrance question but how is the dialogue following the storm going with both insurance carriers as well as your clients. As we think about some insurance companies have pointed to wait going outside of just areas impacted by losses and the reinsurance market and then if we think about the commercial lines market more broadly, some saying maybe this will have the potential to increase weight outside of just property related coverage. So, how is the dialogue going even a way from just whether this is a $50 million to a $100 million event but how is conversations going in and around the level of rate that might come next year?
Daniel Glaser: Thanks Elyse, it's a good question. I'll take it to begin with on in overview standpoint and then I think it's good to hear from both John and Peter to get there their views of what's happening in their respective areas. But I think we have to start by saying insurance market itself is a large global and well capitalized. And there are many insurers and other capital providers, so the market is competitive. Certain markets it's true have been hit pretty hard by these series of events and they're going to one rate increases. That doesn’t mean they're going to get the rate increases they want. I mean, that's where the competitiveness of the market comes in and this is going to play out overtime. Our job is to be on the client side of the table and to get the most comprehensive level of coverage that they're seeking at competitive terms. And so, John you want to talk about what you're seeing at Marsh so far?
John Doyle: Sure, Dan. Good morning, Elyse. Why don’t I start with what we saw in the third quarter and then I can share a little bit of data in what we've seen over the course of the last few weeks. But in the third quarter, rates were down 1.6% which compares to a decline of 2.2% in the second quarter or so. Things have been trending a little bit closer to zero over the course of the last several quarters. But I would say by major product it's a pretty type range when you look at it on a global basis. The U.K. and commonly Europe have continued to remain in those competitive markets on a price change basis. Australia pricing for the second quarter in a row has set up. Looking ahead, insurers have certainly been communicating to us their need for increased rates given the recent cad events. Some were suggesting that the rate need for them as across the board, others have been communicating needs more focused on cad property. As Dan said, it's really too early to tell what I can share is both over the last few weeks in property have ranged from minus five to plus 20 to plus 20 and there are no measurable impact so far in other lines at this point. Now would say in my experience will be unusual for these events that drive pricing in long tail lines. Just maybe for a second talking about the impact of some of these price changes on Marsh, it would be mixed. On the one hand, we could see some modest uplift on pricing from commissionable premium, we'll see a little bit of more work on our claim in our claims operation as well. However it could impact had some impact on our contingent revenue primarily at MMA course. And then we don’t know a buyer bays that would be like, operating in a low growth worldwide our clients are very cost focused at the moment. We'll see whether or not particularly our larger clients to choose to retain more risk over time. Then we'll have places like markets like Porto Rico which will likely face some challenges. Now, also why I now release that we've been expanding our capabilities in property cat, really trying to be responsive to this growing risk for our clients. Dan mentioned the acquisition of Blakestad in the second quarter or in the third quarter, excuse me, we also acquired Torrent, Dan spoke a bit about that and we created alternatives the first ever retail alternative capital facility in the second quarter or so. We're well positioned to help our clients navigate market as we go forward.
Daniel Glaser: Thanks, John. Peter, you want to add to that?
Peter Hearn: Sure, thanks Dan. In the conversations released, we have it reinsurers as is always the takes, we ask them to take it client specific, very measured approach based on their experience, individual clients experience, exposure and their trading relationship with the reinsurers. And preface is it's early it's too early to tell a leading indicators as to where prices is going. But that's the approach that we take, a very balanced and fair approach based on individual company, experience exposure in their trading relationships.
Daniel Glaser: Any other question, Elyse?
Elyse Greenspan: Yes, thank you. And that was very thorough. I appreciate the color. In terms of the margins within RIS, the margin improvement did slow in the third quarter. And I know you guys pointed in your opening commentary that the year-to-date improvement. Was there anything that crept up in the third quarter that caused the slowdown in margins or it was just we see margins up to the year-to-date level?
Daniel Glaser: You should always look to the year-to-date or rolling 12 months or even over multiple years. I mean I were in the 10th year consecutive margin expansion and so they it's a great story considering we're not overly focused on it here at the executive table. But the other things to think about with regard to RIS, the third quarter is our lowest revenue quarters. So, if you've got a some movement expansive would have a larger term impact. But there's nothing underlying that to point to anything that we're concerned with regard to RIS margins.
Elyse Greenspan: Much.
Daniel Glaser: Sure, next question please?
Operator: And our next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan: Good morning and thank you. And just following up these question, the pace of margin expansion. I hope you can talk a little more about underlying drivers in term, do you see any pressure on the wages, any investment you need to make into the fitness and any cost saving opportunities within the organization. And you have talked even past the margin expansion is a byproduct of your driving organic growth budget. I just want to understand it the better.
Mark McGivney: Sure. And what we said in the past is that margin expansion is an outcome of running a business to where almost always you expect to have revenue growth exceeding expense growth of maybe not every corner but certainly every year. And when we looked back in our history, the 35 of the past 38 quarters, we have had revenue growth that exceed expense growth. And so, it's just a core part of the way we operate the business. When you think about things like wage pressure, it's something that we look at carefully, the reality is that our we have converted over the last number of years, more of our compensation to variable that it has been in the past. We still have a large fixed component but the bonus pool is driven by earnings and some measure of topline growth and that drives overall accruals within our bonus pool as you can see. Our earnings has gone up multiple years in a row which if it's a little bit more flexibility when we look at compensation in general because the variable component has ridden over a number of years. In terms of wage growth, it's interesting because in the global economy and here in the U.S. we haven’t really seen that operate, so there is that economic theory about a tightening labor market ultimately playing through with wages, but I think with advances in technology and other factors and that improves efficiency that is not playing out right now. So, there is not any built up demand for wage inflation within the company. It's something that we watch country by country very carefully. You have any other question, Kai?
Kai Pan: Yes, a follow-up just on pricing again. Is that how you position your broker colleagues in the potential changing market place. I should wonder if you can draw any comparison in the past if there is a big changes in market place, how would that impact your customer retention as well as the new business?
Daniel Glaser: Yes, a couple of things. 1) It's interesting to note in every market, that is potentially hardening and I use the word potential year. If you look around the table, you got people who have seen hard markets and soft markets. Most of our careers have been in softer softening market environments, hard markets tend to be pretty swift. But ultimately on the underwriting side and on the booking side, we have a lot of people working for us who never experience a underwriter asking for a rate increase. You could have been in this business for decades and maybe not have ever heard those words. So, it will play itself out. My history in the business is people convert very quickly and it's all comparative in terms of how in achieving and broking the right individual arrange for a client. I think brokers can change very quickly and adaptive to changing market conditions. What it has meant to Marsh & McLennan in the past is generally been a higher levels, a moderately higher levels of prior retention in new business because of a slight equality. We got the broadest specialized placement capabilities in the world. And so, in times of stress, our phone rings more than in times that are easy. Next question, please?
Operator: And our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb: Thank you. Could you update us on enrollment for 2018 in the private health exchange?
Daniel Glaser: Sure. Well, let me just talk a little bit about the marketplace in general because as we said before we liked our capabilities and we like our positioning and we expect Mercer marketplace 365 to be a contributor to Marsh's U.S. health and benefits business going forward. But it's important to understand it's still in the build stage for us and its one solution just one part of an overall tool kit that we use in giving Marsh capabilities in health to clients. And so, I'm not sure if we're going to go into much detail on it. And by the way for us it’s not really an exchange anymore. It's really a platform that is a year around benefits platform. But Julio, you want to add some more to that?
Julio Portalatin: Thank you, Dan and thank you Jay for the question and good morning. Yes, we like to think of our Mercer market place 365 benefits offering as an all year around platform as Dan mentioned. It offers year round benefits like wellness along with the enrollment capability of how as well as voluntary benefits, life insurance, dental and other important coverages. And then 365 continues to be a relatively small part of a overall broad health portfolio. Focus continuous to be in finding the right solution to bend the cost curve on health for our clients. Yet, obviously at times when that is a good fit mainly Mercer market place 365 is a good fit. So, we continue to have confidence that we have a platform that we resonates with our client and it makes sense for some of them to take advantage of them. Mercer market place 365 had a good sales activity here this year and it will be helpful as we pivot to 2018 growth.
Daniel Glaser: So, I feel that would agree with you. I think this is one of the things Jay, that in the past we said that this part of the business was getting too much attention and we thought some of the estimates that have been put out on the industry where we couldn't understand where the numbers were coming from. But ultimately giving things that's specific enrolment data number of lives, that sort of thing on a relatively small part of the subset of our business. This doesn't seem to make sense. So, let's just take it as Julio said they had a strong selling seasoned year which will benefit us in the future and I will leave it at that. You have another question, Jay?
Jay Gelb: That's just fine. Sure, yes. Just a separate question on Guy Carpenter. If we look at environment where it's likely to have some pricing improvement, maybe some increased demand for property related reinsurance covers. How much of a benefit could that be for Guy Carpenter either topline and earnings if you look at past cycles like 2011, 2005?
Daniel Glaser: I mean, we one thing before I hand of to Peter. We built our business to prosper in times that are generally broad market relative level of softness in the market and then every once in a while there is a burst of activity in terms of heightening. But it certainly some of them are still brief, it's hard to refer to them as cycles, per se. And so, that we don’t look at our businesses as really operating under the basis of cycles. It's mainly almost all the way downward and then every once in a while there is a little spurt of something. And so, the other thing is both in Marsh and in Guy Carpenter, there is always a series of puts and takes in terms of how a company's responding and then I'll hand over to Peter. But I would imagine if the market is too tough, many well capitalized insurance, we just make different decisions, right? And so Peter you want to answer that?
Peter Hearn: I think that's right. And this is a business of puts and takes. And more importantly Jay, as I said in the last call we're building Guy Carpenter and delivered consistent growth there irrespective of market conditions. That means we're focused on building strong pipelines for new business and exercising continued discipline around our client service and retention. That we're not building a business that’s depended on rate environment.
Daniel Glaser: Thanks. Next question, please?
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay Cohen: Yes, thanks. Just one question on the consulting side and then the health practice. You said there were some I guess weakness or softness in the U.S. Can you talk about what is driving that?
Daniel Glaser: Okay. So, a couple of things. You mentioned how practice and I would just -- I want to just add a little bit because I know some of our competitors actually have things that they view as they line up business. It's important to know we do a health business had made big business for us than we do it in three different places. I mean, clearly Mercer is a cornerstone of our health business. But all of the winding either a large health practice is well that's focused on different kinds of transformation. It doesn't overlap at all with Mercer's activity. And of course both Marsh and Marsh & McLennan agency have big positions in the employee health and benefits markets. So, it aggregates to a pretty big number and we have different ways of looking at it. But specifically I think you were referring to Mercer in this case. So, Julio why don’t you talk about the Mercer health business a little bit?
Julio Portalatin: Thank you Dan and Jay thanks for the question as well. Good morning. Mercer overall has a pretty diversified and well balanced and geographically spread portfolio as you know. Over the past several quarters and several years, Mercer had delivered some pretty exceptional results in growth area. Now on a quarterly basis, as you can imagine things that some flows and puts and takes, this is why we speak -- like to speak about our growth over a longer period this time versus a particular quarter. In an event, let's take help as you mentioned as an example, our health business has pockets of good growth and some challenging areas, as an example our admin business which as you knows part of our health results continues to grow but go through a profitability improvement exercise which at times when contracts come up for renewal, obviously we take some pricing action sometimes they need sometimes they don’t but we are very focused on improving profitability. This makes it kind of a drag in some quarters on overall health growth. On the other hand, our commission brokers work, particularly in the U.S. remain strong with increases in retention as an example, uncertainty in the U.S. in particular has the way some decisions while others are starting to show some movement, so all that said we continue to invest in expanding our health business especially around acquisitions like content online or global proposition for health, a great platform that really is a competitive advantage for us and will pay off in the long run and of course our investments organically in most of marketplace 365.
Daniel Glaser: Thanks Julio. JD, do you have something up?
John Doyle: No, that’s it. Thanks a lot guys.
Daniel Glaser: Okay, thank you. Next question please.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Larry Greenberg with Janney.
Larry Greenberg: Hi, thank you. Just a quickie, I think earlier in the year you have indicated that some of the acquisitions you had done late last year were putting some pressure on margins in the first half of this year and you just needed to better scale to have those margins move up more in line with where you are. Can you just talk about that and whether there's still a bit of a drag from some of those deals that you did?
Daniel Glaser: I'll take that Larry and then I will hand over to Mark to give you a little bit more but, there was a few things Mercer in particular acquired some companies at the very tail-end of last year that were more leaning toward higher growth technology based organizations so by their very definition have a little bit more dilution to them in the early stages but we respect their higher levels of growth to make up for that over time and make them good acquisitions and so it's a little bit different than some of the other businesses that we've acquired but Mark can add to that?
Mark McGivney: Larry, in the comments we have made, we were specifically consulting business and if you remember back to the first couple of quarters, we can talk about how the underlying performance of the business which [indiscernible] was just being masked by these acquisitions. And then you start to see that as the [indiscernible] left in the back half of the year are doing well but we have had if you just look at the headline gap growth numbers acquisitions have contributing quite a bit which is a good story, the thing you keep in mind and when we talked about this the acquisitions are ahead within the near term because we're the purchase accounting through our results. We think pretty substantial growth and intangible amortization while we were delivering this solid NOI growth but as you see in the back half of the year some of the headwinds we talked about and mentioned. 
Daniel Glaser: I'm glad that Mark mentioned the GAP revenue growth because I think it's important to look like and look at, the people who look at Marsh the 9% growth for an awfully big, high quality company in a given quarter that's going to benefit us enormously in coming years, sure it's not an underlying and we want to see better underlying growth but ultimately we were happy with that number. Do we have another question, Larry?
Larry Greenberg: No, I am good. Thank you.
Daniel Glaser: Next question please.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Arash Soleimani with KBW. 
Arash Soleimani: Thanks, just a start off, I have quick question, you mentioned, closing the protection gap in flood and I'm just curious to get your thoughts on how meaningful the wakeup call you think the third quarter events could serve towards starting to bridge that gap?
Daniel Glaser: It's a great question. It’s a U.S. question and it’s also a global question, the protection gap is meaningful if you look over decades of time, more catastrophe risk and in particular flood has been transferred to taxpayers in post event type of situation then actually insurance company through these transfer, the value that the private market bring, it’s enough sure was transferred private markets with their capital risk and offer risk modification recommendations and other invitees which tend to reduce level of losses over time and it is something happens when it's a government entity that is funding on a post lost basis through taxpayer dollars and so we hope it's a wakeup call but we're not -- we're just not sure about it.  If you look at the situation where okay pre the series of loss events, U.S. policyholder surplus was at around $725 billion which was an all time record and at the same time premium to surplus ratios were lower than they've been in the last 25 years. So we have this capital that at the right prices available to apply against risk and then on the other hand you have situations like flood in the United States which we view as the principal risk facing our clients and there's just a mismatch. So we spent a lot of time talking about it and we will see where it goes over the time but we do think there needs to be more collective energy between the entire industry, long voices so I don't think to carry much weight in any capital. Any other questions?
Arash Soleimani: Just one other quick question, I was just curious if you have any thoughts on the potential whether there would loss adjustment expense surprised sort to speak with what the catch in the third quarter. I know I can't have a claim operation I think older claims maybe that have some inside to provide, I am just curious to get your thoughts on the last number increasing on the LAE side.
Mark McGivney: LAE, it has to be more of a percentage of overall losses as opposed to anything else and I think that there may be some stretching of adjustment expenses only because you look at a series of catastrophe and the strain that puts on organizations like loss adjustment firms, contractors etcetera the costs tend to rise as the number of them available for the next job decreases and certainly the number of claims has been close to unprecedented in a very short period of time and so that in another itself put some strain on getting the right people to do the adjustment but I would say the industry itself steps up pretty well in the event of catastrophes and there's not much quibbling that is going on, it’s more of just getting the information and cutting a check and so from that standpoint I wouldn't expect no wrong drawn out process on property claims. Now on business interruption claim that’s a little bit different and so maybe that becomes more of an area but that would be sort of typical of what are expense adjustments are and loss adjustments are on a post catastrophe on BI claim. So we will see much in that area. Next question please.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Dave Styblo with Jefferies.
Dave Styblo: Hi there, good morning, thanks for the question. I just want to come back to Mercer numbers in the third quarter here; I know you guys certainly always fun to looking at a trailing base year to date in that regard I guess the flat growth here is and about the slowest in the quarter that we've seen in quite some time and some of it sounds like it's a slowdown in project based work, I'm curious if there are any other factors that cause it to be flat this quarter? I know you had mentioned your colleagues were affected to some extent so did that, was that a factor in slowing down productivity? But just generally, three of the four businesses were slower year over year and as you look forward, do you guys have visibility on some of those businesses rebounding, coming back on at this point?
Daniel Glaser: Sure, sure. No it's a good question and obviously something that we began to regulate, I would say a couple of things to start and then I will hand over to Julio, I think [indiscernible] heard over there like a comparator to last year because there was a zero in third quarter ’16 and 4% this time and Julio may have been willing to trade on that one could Mercer was 3% in the third of 2016, so I think that has some factor there and one of the reasons why I mean these are our clients businesses that have long kind of relationships to them and so looking quarter by quarter is really not the right way to look at the business, the way I look at the business is that on a year to date basis, Marsh & McLennan Companies has had a three which is exactly where we were on a year to date basis at the consolidated company last year. And if you recall going into this year, we sort of said our expectation was that 2017 would look a lot like 2016 and I think that has played itself out including the kind of margin expansion that we've seen in 70 BIPS [ph] year to date same as last year, year to date and when I look at the individual operating companies, I've got three operating companies up from last year and one operating company down on a year to date basis and so that that is just if I look at Marsh is at three versus a two, [indiscernible] four versus two, OW is at six versus three and Mercer is two versus a three, in the overall mix that is not an unusual year from us, we will have a different outcome on that mix each time but ultimately we rarely have all four up goes up at the same time and then there is usually some variability but Julio get, do you want add a little briefly to that?
Julio Portalatin: Yes. Thank you for the question. As I mentioned earlier on any given quarter we can have some adds and flows and puts and takes in the business. As an example when we talk a little bit about a wealth, Mercer had continue to grow earnings and new offerings in wealth business. We also continue to make acquisitions, not just in wealth but in other areas like contents online, [indiscernible] solutions which we think will serve us well on growth a well into the future. On the wealthy area, you've heard me speak about the continued double digit growth success that we're having in our investment management delegate solutions and in fact we surpass 230 billion of assets under delegated management which further certifies our industry position. Now in the wealth business, you also have the VB consulting actuarial business, so you have an offset in the total growth trajectory because that is a business which we all know is under pressure and it is mostly to do with the decreasing VB program and then in addition to that impact of less project work around cash out and buy out has impacted this quarter. So things like that again will be adds and flows, puts and take when everything is said and done Marsh has done a pretty good job of being able to get growth both organically and inorganic investments pointing to growth and we expect that to continue with refute. Since we're on the consulting segment, I just want to take a moment because all of the lining while volatile, having more volatility than the other of course had been able to outgrow the other outgrows over a longer stretch of time and had a decent quarter on the topline this quarter at 7%. But Scott, do you want to talk a little bit about growth in OW?
Scott McDonald: Sure, thanks Dan. We had a what I describe as a good quarter, with strong growth across most areas of the portfolio. It was particularly strong in the public sector or actuarial business and in our health business. We alternate really strong growth in our growth markets in particular Asia and the Middle East. And I think we could grow even faster than this. What's held us back in the third quarter from stronger growth is Europe, still remains a little sluggish and it's a overall demand for consultant, our branding business was a little weak given the up level in global branding. And we're still managing out transition in our big financial services business from regulatory to more strategic work. But in all three of those areas we feel some momentum, if anything market demand is picking up as global growth seems to be picking up at least modestly, and our medium term targets to have growth in mid to high single digits are fully intact.
David Styblo: Thanks, got it. That's great color on that.
Daniel Glaser: Dave, David. Yes, anything else, David?
David Styblo: I did, I don’t want to beat the rates the rates earning to depth here as you guys are talking about how uncertain it is at this point. But I'm wondering maybe as a history lesson, it seems like 2005 is the most common parallel. I'm wondering if you guys could just talk a little bit about the parallels or differences that you can draw from a national disaster that impacted your business back then. How they might be different or similar to the one that are affecting it now. And I'm just trying to think of things we might not be considering such as supply of capital is a lot more robust. But are there other factors that you would point us to say "Hey, this is what you should be thinking about as you frame the impact of the industry."
Daniel Glaser: I think there's just too many moving parts here, David. In fact, in your last comments in terms of the number of capital providers or the supplied capital, you think about where the market was in 2005 versus where it is in 2017. It's a completely different situation. The number of insurance companies that right more than a billion dollars of premium as an example in the United States. The level of improvement on data and analytics, it really means that any emergent, frankly after things like KRW of alternative capital in the growth in alternative capital and other ways of companies dealing with risk transfer off of primary markets into the reinsurance market. I mean, there are many moving parts there. I would say that certain insurance companies have been hit pretty hard. Policy holders' surplus getting wacked in the double digits and those insurance companies are going to be seeking rate. And they are going to be seeking rate probably everywhere that they issue a policy. And so, then the question becomes well what will other insurance companies do. Will they use this opportunity as a way to slot in somewhere beneath the incumbent as a way to grow their share in this time because they may not have been heard as badly. Now, this is a global market. If you look at the top 20 insurance companies, many of them are global but it's also a local market and a regional market. So, as John was saying earlier, the idea that in some country in Latin America or Asia, the casualty pricing will go up as a result of loss activity in the United States when there is so many regional and local champions to take the account if rates go up too high in those areas. That puts a lot of competitive pressure aware the terms of conditions will ultimately outlines that. We love to give you more but this is where our market place operates. And the losses are still being developed as we were saying earlier, the model numbers are far higher than what the aggregate reported numbers are. So, either the modelers are incorrect right now or the actual reported numbers are too low and will rise over time which will put more pressure on rating levels. We'll just have to see how it plays out. Next question please?
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.
Paul Newsome: Good morning. Just a couple of little simple questions, I think. I want to ask you about the discreet tax items and sort of the sustainability of those discreet items over time?
Daniel Glaser: Sure, so Mark?
Mark McGivney: Yes, sure. Paul, we've been dealing with all here. There is this required accounting change related to stock based compensation which has big impact in our first quarter which we quantified in less impact and subsequence. So, we did have a few discreet item that affected our adjusted tax rate. But that tax accounting change was the largest and it is unpredictable just based on option exercise activity and when stock based. So, that will be something going forward. That accounting changes is permanent if you will and we will have option exercises and equity based compensation at best. But the amount of that volume is going to be a little bit volatile, depends on our stock price and when people actually take the action. That was the largest discreet item in the quarter.
Paul Newsome: Well, that makes a lot of sense. And then my second question. Just if there's any update on your thoughts about the revenue accounting change perspectively, how we should be thinking about that when we're thinking about earnings estimates for 2018?
Mark McGivney: Yes, and it's still too early to give you. First, I'd have to give a little bit of color. It is a as you can appreciate beyond our industry of the company dealing with this pretty comprehensive change to revenue recognition. And it is going to have a meaningful impact on the timing of not only our revenue recognition but the earnings pattern as well. So, I'll give you a little bit but it won't be till later in the year when we can give you a specific. So, there will be an impact on the timing of revenue in RIS for us more so than consulting. Most of the action we expect will be across the quarters, within our year most of our contracts are fairly short term in nature. In Guy Carpenter for instance, there'll be an acceleration of revenue and a core to share business and some of our trading business. In March we'll have some acceleration, some fee based business and a couple of other areas. But again most of the action among quarters or cross quarters within a year is opposed to the past years. Both of our segment, there is also the element of this which I'll show you, pretty sure that involves the furl of expenses that will affect both of our segments. And in most of the impact there again would expect cross quarters within the year as opposed to cross there but there will be certain elements or categories with expense that will have amortization periods that will spend a year. So, it is comprehensive, and as said we get through the last part of the year we'll have more specificity for you. And our goal through all of this, I mean as I said would be a meaningful change our goal be to try to provide a much transparency as possible so you can baseline the results as accurately as you can and at least get a sense of underlying performance.
Paul Newsome: I'm still wondering if this is something what we do talking about in December right before we get into the earnings announcements or if you look come earlier than that. Just from a mechanical perspective and setting expectations for quarters.
Mark McGivney: Yes. I think at this point forward, still uncertain I mean certainly between now in our Q4 earnings call we like we will not say anything.
A - Daniel Glaser: Okay, well. I'd like to draw the call to a close and thank everybody on the call this morning for joining us today. I'd like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication and serving them. Have a good day everyone. Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Marsh & McLennan Companies' Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. I'll now turn the conference over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you, very much. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is our Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Dan Farrell of Investor Relations. Before we begin, I would like to thank Peter Zaffino for his many contributions to both Marsh and Guy Carpenter over his 15 plus years with the company. We wish Peter continued success and look forward to working with him as he moves on to the next phase of his career. Marsh & McLennan has a deep bench of leadership talent. We are constantly looking to invest and add capabilities to our organization. Talent is a key area of focus in this regard, and we were both opportunistic and strategic when we acquired talent. Last year, we added John Doyle and Peter Hearn to our organization, two experienced and highly regarded industry executes. I've worked with John for almost 20 years, and I can tell you that his transition into the Marsh's CEO role will be seamless. Over the past year, he's been a key part of setting strategy as President of Marsh, as well as being a member of the MMC Executive Committee. John has more than 30 years of insurance industry experience and provides a thoughtful perspective on the future of our industry and potential growth opportunities. He has a proven track record of strong leadership, success in building client relationships, and inspiring colleagues. Since he joined Marsh, John has been heavily focused on client service and retention, and these will continue to be key areas of emphasis going forward. I'm also happy to have Peter Hearn, the CEO of Guy Carpenter, joined the MMC Executive Committee. Over the past year, his leadership has had a meaningful impact on Guy Carpenter's already strong record of performance. Throughout their carriers, John and Peter have built strong relationships across the insurance value chain. While both have led successful large organizations, I believe their enthusiasm for improving the client experience sets them apart, and will benefit overall growth going forward. In addition, Julio and Scott continue to demonstrate tremendous leadership and have delivered impressive results at Mercer and Oliver Wyman. With these operating company heads, combined with the rest of our Executive Committee, I believe, we have the strongest leadership team in the industry. That said, the performance of our company goes well beyond senior management. Our success is driven by strong teams throughout the firm executing and making decisions where they matter most, close to our clients. While we invest for the future, we continue to emphasize the basics, delivering for clients every day, adding value and pursuing new opportunities with the sense of urgency and passion. We continue to invest in technology, digital, data and analytics to drive innovation and faster growth. In this regard, we've had several important announcements since last quarter, Mercer recently launched Mercer Digital an integrated business across health, wealth and career to better leverage the digital capabilities that have been built in the organization. Our data and technology combined with specialized Consulting expertise positions Mercer Digital to help organization's transition to a digital future while ensuring their work force thrives. As part of this initiative, Mercer announced Rohit Mehrotra will be taking a new role as CEO of Mercer Digital. Rohit came to MMC when we bought his fifth startup CPSG, that acquisition has performed well for us and we are pleased that he is taking a broader role in Mercer. Earlier this month, Mercer also announced an equity investment in PayScale a cloud based provider of compensation management software and real time salary data. Together, we will collaborate on new innovative compensation and workforce data products and solutions. Another important announcement was Marsh's hire of Sastry Durvasula as Chief Digital Officer and Chief Data and Analytics Officer. Sastry brings an in-depth knowledge of digital technologies and will oversee the strategic design, development and delivery of digital capabilities, data and analytics and client-facing technology. We also continue to broaden our participation in the technology and innovation landscape. For example, we recently added to our relationship with the private equity firm, Aquiline Capital Partners, by participating as one of the anchor investors in a new fund focused on early stage technology companies in insurance, as well as asset management, retirement and benefits. We will continue to invest capital to shift our mix of business to faster growing segments and geographies. These are just examples of some of the numerous partnerships, investments and strategic initiatives underway across our organization to position ourselves to thrive and shape the future. We talk about balance in many aspects of our strategy and philosophy. And the events of this quarter highlight another dimension of balance in how we operate MMC. While we continue to innovate and position for future long term growth, we remain focused on delivering today. This requires rigorous attention to the fundamentals and maintaining focus on the client. Technology advancements, increasing complexity and the pace of change in the world, represent significant challenges for our clients to address in the areas of risk, strategy and people. We are uniquely positioned to support them and help them succeed. Now let's turn to some highlights of our results. Our second quarter performance was solid and in line with our expectations. We produced consolidated underlying revenue growth of 3% with growth across all four operating companies. Operating income was up 5%, while adjusted operating income increased 7%. EPS was $0.96, up 7% and adjusted EPS rose 10% to $1. And on a consolidated basis, the adjusted operating margin improved 70 basis points. For the six months, underlying revenue growth was 3% and the consolidated adjusted margin expanded 70 basis points. EPS for the six month period grew 13% on a GAAP basis and 14% on an adjusted basis. Looking at Risk & Insurance Services, second quarter revenue was $1.9 billion with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income increased 9% to $535 million, with our margin expanding 110 basis points to 27.9%, the highest second quarter margin in 30 years. For the six month period, underlying revenue grew 3%, similar to the full year growth rate in 2015 and 2016. Adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion rose 10% and the adjusted margin also improved 110 basis points to 29.1%. In the Consulting segment, second quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, up 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 3% in the quarter to $298 million. The margin of 18.7% was flat with the prior year. Similar to the first quarter, recent M&A activity impacted earnings. We anticipate improvement as the year progresses and expect Consulting to deliver solid earnings growth and margin expansion for 2017. In summary, we are pleased with the results for the first half of the year. For the full year 2017, we continue to expect underlying revenue growth within the 3% to 5% range that we have operated in for the past seven years, margin expansion in both operating segments and strong growth in adjusted EPS. With that, let me turn it over to Mark.
Mark Christopher McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Dan, and good morning. In the second quarter, we delivered solid results driven by underlying revenue growth across all four of our operating companies. Overall, revenue was up 4% or 3% on an underlying basis. Operating income in the quarter increased 5%, while adjusted operating income was up 7% to $788 million. Our adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 22.5%. GAAP EPS rose 7% to $0.96 and adjusted EPS increased 10% to $1. Looking at Risk & Insurance Services, second quarter revenue was $1.9 billion, with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income increased 9% to $535 million, with our margin expanding 110 basis points to 27.9%. For the first six months of the year, revenue was $3.9 billion with underlying growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income for the first half of the year increased 10% to $1.1 billion with a margin of 29.1% also up 110 basis points. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 4%, with acquisition activity over the last 12 months continuing to contribute to overall growth. As we expected, underlying revenue growth of 2% in second quarter was tempered following the strong underlying growth of 5% in the first quarter. As we've said in the past, we think it is more appropriate to look at underlying revenue trends over a longer period of time. For the first six months, as well as the trailing 12 months, Marsh's underlying growth was 3%. The international division underlying growth was 1% in the second quarter. EMEA revenue was flat, Asia-Pacific rose 3%, and Latin America grew 4%. For the first six months, international underlying revenue growth was 3%. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 2% in the quarter and was 3% for the first six months. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $293 million, an increase of 3%, or 4% on an underlying basis, representing another strong quarter for Guy Carpenter. It was better we had expected. Strength in underlying revenue growth in the quarter was broad-based, reflecting growth in North America, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific, as well as increased demand for retrocessional reinsurance. Underlying revenue growth for the first six months was also 4%, while underlying growth over the trailing 12 months was 3%. In the Consulting segment, revenue of $1.6 billion was up 3%, or 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 3% to $298 million, while the margin held constant at 18.7%. Similar to the first quarter, active M&A in Mercer at the end of last year and foreign exchange were headwinds to Consulting earnings growth. However, underlying results remain strong and we continue to expect solid operating earnings improvement and margin expansion in Consulting for the full year 2017. Mercer's revenue increased 3% in the quarter to $1.1 billion and was up 3% on an underlying basis. Within Wealth, Investment Management & Related Services increased 11%, while Defined Benefit Consulting & Administration declined 3%. Overall Wealth grew 1% in the quarter. Assets under delegated management at quarter end were $191 billion, increasing 8% over the first quarter and 30% year-over-year. Health increased 3%, with solid growth in North America and Latin America. Career underlying growth was 5% with strong growth in surveys and our consulting around workday implementation. Oliver Wyman's revenue increased 5% in the quarter to $483 million. Underlying growth was 7%, representing another solid performance led by strong growth in the United States, Asia, and the Middle East. Investment income was $5 million compared with $1 million in the second quarter of last year. We expect the contribution from investment income will be de minimis for the remainder of 2017. Foreign exchange in the quarter was a slight headwind to NOI, with a negative impact in Consulting, partially offset by a small positive in RIS. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect minimal impact to NOI from FX for the remainder of the year. Our adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was 28.6%, compared with 29.1% in the second quarter of last year. Through the first half of the year, our adjusted tax rate was 25.9%, compared with 28.8% last year. The year-to-date tax rate in 2017 includes the impact of the required change in accounting for equity awards, which had a significant impact on our rate in the first quarter. We continue to expect a 29% tax rate for the remainder of 2017 excluding any impact from discrete items. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $5.6 billion compared with $5.9 billion at the end of the first quarter, reflecting the repayment of $250 million of senior notes on April 1. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us flexibility, modest near-term repayment obligation. Our next scheduled debt repayment is not until the fourth quarter of 2018, when we have $250 million of notes maturing. In the second quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of our stock for $200 million. Through six months, the company has repurchased 5.4 million shares for $400 million. Second quarter marks the 21st consecutive quarter we have bought back our stock. Since announcing our commitment to reduce our annual share count at Investor Day in March 2014, shares outstanding have declined by 36 million or 7%. Our cash position at end of the second quarter was $966 million, with approximately $118 million in the United States. Uses of cash in the second quarter totaled $442 million and included $200 million for share repurchases, $176 million for dividends and $66 million for acquisitions. For the first six months, uses of cash totaled $1.3 billion and included $400 million for share repurchases, $351 million for dividends, and $523 million for acquisitions. In May, our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.34 to $0.375 per share. For the full year 2017, we expect to deploy capital in line with the level in 2016 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. First half of 2017 represents a strong start to the year with 3% underlying revenue growth, 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 14% adjusted EPS growth. As Dan said, for the full year, we continue to expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion in both segments and strong growth in adjusted EPS. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we're ready to go to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. We're going to go to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, and good morning. First, congratulations to John for the new position. I'm wondering, for John, if you could about more, about your strategic focus at Marsh? And how do you tie that with the current market condition in term P&C pricing?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Kai. It's Dan, I'll just start a little bit by saying how thrilled I am that John is part of the team. And as you know, over the last several years, Marsh is doing well, so it's not crying out for massive amounts of change. But having said that, every business can be improved of – and I'm sure John will put his own mark on the organization and I'm looking forward to seeing the further developments as we go forward. But John, do you want to add a little bit of flavor to that?
John Q. Doyle - Marsh LLC: Sure. Good morning, Kai and thank you. I guess, so I'd start by saying that I spent a lot of time with Dan and Peter to make sure that we were aligned on strategy before I join the team. I would also note that I was quite involved in the plan that we presented to the MMC board of directors last fall, so I wouldn't anticipate any major changes to this strategy. I do want us to operate in a more simple and agile way, so take a look at our org structure and I want us to do with the highest professional standards.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah, thanks, John. So, basically some structural changes, some simplification and some emphasis on the client experience and client initiatives around retention. You have anything else, Kai?
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. And just follow-up on that. You talk about the current market condition, because some said that the pricing is stabilizing and some said, it become increasing more competitive. How do you see that from your perspective and then you've had headwind or tailwind to your business and seems like, there is a little bit slowing down in organic growth in brokerage segments for this quarter but if you look at like the first half, probably still in your range. I just wondering, is the pricing – well, pricing continue to be putting some pressure on the organic growth in brokerage? Thanks.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Well, I think that pricing has put pressure on organic growth across the businesses for number of years now. I wouldn't look at the second quarter as being the start of the new trend driven by price or premium reductions. As you were just saying yourself, yeah, looking at the first half of the year, Marsh was at a 3%, which is consistent with where they were last year and the year before and so that's probably a more appropriate way to look at that. But what do you see in rates and premium, Scott?
Scott McDonald - Oliver Wyman Group: So there is no meaningful change in pricing in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter of the year, overall rates declined a bit more than 2%. UK rates under a bit more pressure where the decline was in the 4% range. We did observe some modest increases in some classes of business and at some territories, commercial auto for example. Australia saw some modest increases in the quarter. So we did observe that. But we expect the market to remain competitive overall.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Scott. Next question please.
Operator: We'll go to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. My first question, so it seems like there was a bit of an organic revenue shift from the second to the first quarter which is why you guys kind of gearing us towards the half year one numbers. I'm just interested, is this something that we should think about or thinking about the second half of the year and I guess this kind of impacted both your U.S. and international business. Just any more color that you can just kind of give just in terms of the timing shift throughout the different businesses. And if you could also just let us know how the growth within the MMA was in the quarter and for the first half of the year?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. So a couple of things. I wouldn't overemphasize shifts of business, I mean clearly some things move around quarter-by-quarter, I wouldn't take too much into it. As we've said a couple of times and as we've done over the last few years, the back half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter usually is a bit stronger for us on an overall business basis, so I will look at it that way. We're happy with our first half results in general, not only on a growth basis, but also we're getting growth from acquisitions, some of which we're giving up in FX, but there is growth in acquisitions which is going to benefit us in future years. We like the fact that our adjusted operating income was reasonably well up given the growth rate and as well as EPS, margin expansion hit our expectations. So overall, we're happy with the first six months and we're looking forward to the next six months. In terms of MMA, we don't breakout MMA other than to say they had a nice quarter and the basic thing that we said all the way starting back in 2009 was that we expected MMA to be able to outgrow Marsh and all I'll say is that, yes, they have been doing that and they did it in the second quarter as well.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then my second question, you guys saw 110 basis points of margin expansion in RIS Q2 and the first half of the year. I know last quarter you guys had said maybe margins would be a bit tempered, just the Q2 was pretty strong in that regard. Can you just comment on without giving exact numbers just your forward outlook on the margin view there and just initiatives that you're working on within both Marsh and Guy Carpenter to continue to be able to manage your expense base and improve your margins there?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. And generally, I mean when I look at the RIS segment, we're in a pretty modest GDP world with basic rate levels in the P&C sector in almost all geographies and in almost all lines of business going down. Now going down may be at pace, it's not quite as steep as it was last year, but it's still going down. And so when I speak about margins, one way to look at it is, we would have liked to grow Marsh more in the second quarter than we did and operate expense controls throughout the year and recognizing that we are in this kind of lower growth environment and so that's the one of the reasons why the margin may have passed a little bit more than what we originally expected because we would have thought that we could have grown a little bit more than 2%, and we're pretty comfortable that 2% is not the new reality, but that we will have quarters, every once in a while, that look like that. Just like we'll have some quarters every once in a while like last quarter where Marsh grew 5%. It didn't make 5% the new world, 2% is not necessarily the new world either. And so, our expense controls tend to be multi-quarter, right, even a multi-year, and so there is – that's why the margin may move around a little bit.
Operator: We'll go to our next question with Larry Greenberg with Janney.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Good morning, and thank you. Dan, just wondering, if you can talk about – I don't know, it was mentioned in one of the publications this quarter, that you're starting kind of in an alternative capital backed facility for retail property, casualty, I think the name of it was Alternus, can you just give us some color on that?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Yeah, I'll do a little and then I'll hand off to John to give you a little bit more. But basically it's not property and casualty, it is property. And basically the way to look at it is, there is a major insurance company Allianz that had always wanted to participate in a more significant way in United States property, but they were – they felt they had enough cash. And so that was an inhibitor of greater levels of participations. And Marsh very creatively sought through, well, how can we marry up their appetite with alternative capital, and sought alternative capital using a high degree of Marsh data and Marsh analytics to create more of a portfolio look to the property portfolio that Marsh has. And that was a combination between Allianz and Nephila, which at the end result means that they're willing to write virtually every property account of Marsh and they're willing to write that at a guaranteed discount to the client of 7.5% off of any other markets pricing for the balance of the placement. And so it's clearly a win for the client, it's a win for the market because that certainly bringing a market like Allianz to the forefront with alternative capital backing is a big positive and it's another example of Marsh innovation. Now I haven't checked in lately as to how often this is doing et cetera. But, John, do you want to add something to that?
John Q. Doyle - Marsh LLC: As you mentioned that we announced it in April, so it's still relatively early but the take-up rate so far has been positive. The feedback we've gotten from our clients has been positive as well, so more efficient solution for our large property clients. So we think it's a great way where Marsh can bring better value to our clients than we had before.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Great. Thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Anything else, Larry?
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Yeah. Any update on the FSA (sic) [FCA] investigation and I guess, does it mean anything that the PRA is now looking at facilities?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Well, a couple of things. No, there's no update in terms of the FCA that that investigation is ongoing and we're cooperating fully. We imagine it will take quite a while for them to work through their analysis and come to some sort of determinations, but it's really all that I'll say on that at that time. Now in terms of the FCA review of the wholesale market, they do that on a periodic basis. And I don't see any connectivity between the FCA review which may entail a review of facilities as well as – with the investigation that's going on in the aviation sector.
Operator: And we'll next to Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just a question for Dan, on – thinking about the relationship between margins and an organic growth. So the emphasis, I hear your views on the stability of organic within Marsh, how it's been 3% pretty much year-to-date. It's been like that in 2015, 2016. And if we would've gone back to 2015 when it was at 3% – we talked about the headwinds – we might not have thought it was going to stay at 3%. But I think if we knew it was going to be at 3%, we probably wouldn't have thought you would have expanded margins by 2 to 3 points. So I guess, what I'm wondering is, has kind of the fundamental equation changed about what gets you margin expansion, do you still need well in excess of 3% over time? Or I guess, another way to ask it is, under what conditions would margins not expand going forward what you've been able to deliver with just 3% organic growth?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: It's a good question, and it's something that we wrestle with as a leadership team. I mean, at the end, clearly, we are finding ways to operate the business in a more efficient manner and improve our productivity over time. And we've done that for a number of years. I mean, just to remind everyone, we're in the – 2017 is our 10th year of margin expansion. And this hasn't been a little bit of expansion. This has been significant consistent levels of expansion over time. We are in a more for less business. Our job is to deliver more value to our clients every year at fundamentally better levels of efficiency within our own organization. So that search for a smarter way, that search for additional operational efficiency, that never ends. And when I look into the future, whether it's robotics, whether it's deep learning, AI, et cetera, I think there'll be all kinds of avenues for us to become a more efficient organization as we go forward. So, I don't think the margin story is different. Now, do I think the margin will expand typically more when we have a better top line than 3%? Yes. Do I think that 13% adjusted EPS growth over the long term will be far easier to achieve with a better top line? Yes. So, we are doing everything possible to position the company through mix of business, through acquisition strategy, through organic investment on an ongoing basis to spur growth into the future regardless of market conditions, because our anticipation is the market's going to be similar to where it is today. And so, and anything to the upside, I think, would be a benefit to us. In terms of margins, in general, I can tell you, when we're around the leadership table, margin doesn't come up. Earnings growth comes up, revenue growth comes up, acquisitions come up, but actually, we think that margin expansion is not a strategy per se, it's an outcome of how we run the business properly. And really, one of the core philosophies of the company is that revenue growth should exceed expense growth almost every quarter and certainly every year. And so, when we look at it on that basis, it's just a natural outcome.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you very much for the answer.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Anything else, Ryan?
Operator: We'll go next to Dave Styblo with Jefferies.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Dan, I'd like to come back to sort of the lead in that you came up with in terms of the technology and digital investments and hires that you made. And I'm just curious to hear a little bit more about the genesis of that. I'm sure it's been incubating in your minds for quite some time. But are these strategic initiatives something that you've been hearing clients ask for? And so it's a little bit more a response from that or is it something that you just think can help out with better retention and new wins or maybe some sort of a combination of both or other factors?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. And maybe, it's a great question and no, it's not a client response, although it is definitely the clients at the table in our discussions and thinking through it as to how we can improve the client experience. A factor of me being in the business for more than 35 years is I've seen other changes. As an example, I remember when companies thought that email was a proprietary value, or I remember when people were asked about well what is their Internet strategy, or actually in the beginning, what was your world wide web strategy, okay. So, ultimately the way I look at it is, all companies that expect to be successful in the future will be digital on some basis or another. And so, I don't believe that this is necessarily a next year thing. I think we're positioning the company to be successful long into the future. When we consider digital, we really look across three dimensions. It's not just about growth, it's about growth, operational efficiency and clearly people who work for our organization. And so, in terms of growth, it's really about the client experience and the robustness of our offerings and some of our acquisition strategy. So, you look at Thomsons or PayScale Equity Investment or Torrent or Dovetail. They're one way or the other all digital players. If you look at Mercer 365, it's a technology play, it's a user experience play. In terms of efficiency, we are beginning to experiment. Now I would emphasize experiment. You're not going to see early term results for bots or robotics, automation, machine learning, that kind of stuff. Although there are parts of our business where we will increasingly look to utilize that kind of capability and see how we can become more efficient. And in terms of people, I mean, Sastry and Rohit are just two examples. There's many others of how we're adding new skills to the organization and we're hiring more data scientists, more developers and this is going to be an ongoing process. But I just wanted to highlight that for us, the battle has been joined.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. That's really helpful. Maybe just a little bit more on some of the results for the quarter. So, on reinsurance, you guys had another really strong quarter again, impressive at 4%, and just was trying to get a better sense on the macro conditions right now. Are you guys continuing to see the pricing environment declines become less of a headwind? Let me start there. And then kind of more forward-looking, and kind of canvassing, it looks like there were a few reinsurance contract losses that I believe mostly start in the second half, couple in Florida with People's Trust and Capitol Preferred and then also with Argo. I think, all three of those went to the same competitor, so that being the case, are you guys starting to see any sort of irrational competitor pricing behavior or are there other reasons you can point to for that? Or again I'm sure there's always pluses and minuses in every quarter and is this just sort of a sample or is this something that seems to be a little bit more pointed this quarter rather than in prior quarters?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure, sure. So I'll start and then I'll hand off to Peter. One, I could say that that we're really as an organization very pleased with Guy Carpenter and that's not a short-term phenomena. Guy Carpenter has grown underlying revenue 25 over the last 26 quarters, best-in-class growth by far. And ultimately has built some share and wins a lot more than it loses. And so from that standpoint, we're proud of the organization. And we're very excited about adding somebody like Peter to the mix, top tier, reinsurance executive, seasoned, smell of the market on them and so I expect if that Guy Carpenter will continue to perform super well relative to its peer group over a long stretch of time of Peter. With that lead up what could you possibly say?
Peter C. Hearn - Guy Carpenter & Co. LLC: I think I smell pretty good. David, a couple of things, with regard to pricing, there still remains modest headwinds, we're seeing some flattening of pricing on casualty side, on the property side, and the life side, and accident side, there's still fairly aggressive pricing both in the traditional and in the alternative capital markets. With regards to the loss of business, we have an incredibly high retention ratio within Guy Carpenter. Having said that, it is incumbent upon us to build a very strong robust and disciplined production platform in the event that we do in fact lose business that we can replace it quickly, and we do that.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you. Thank you. Next question, operator.
Operator: We'll go to Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks and good morning.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Good morning.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: With regard to Consulting, the expectation in earnings growth would improve in the back half because of less of a drag from client, merger activity, is double-digit operating growth in the back half, the reasonable expectation?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah, a couple of things, one, it's not the acquisitions of clients that is impacting their top or bottom line, it's really acquisitions that Mercer made really in December that has created a short-term hiccup to earnings and an impact on margins. And so, that will sought itself out as growth begins to come in. And so, it's really – it's not – I mean, at the end, we think that there's been pretty consistent strong levels of growth both in our Oliver Wyman and Mercer. And when we look at the back half of the year, we really don't give margin expectations or operating income expectations. We do believe we'll have solid earnings growth in Consulting for the year and we will have margin expansion for the year. Now, what that is, I mean, at the end, when I look at Consulting's margins, I mean, in the last five years, they're up 680 basis points. And so given the first half of the year, I don't think you can have a dramatic increase in margins consistent with 680 basis points over a five year period. But having said that, we do expect to see margin expansion in the back half.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's helpful, Dan. And then with regard to RIS, it would seem that earnings growth – the earnings growth rate will probably need to be higher in the back half than it was in the first half for RIS to achieve your full year EPS growth goal. Am I on track for that as well?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: I mean, overall, we do – we expect the company, particularly, building momentum through the back half of the year with usually a stronger fourth and third, but we don't really have an annual goal with regard to adjusted EPS or margin expansion. We expect this to be a good solid year. I mean, when I – when we started the year, I was asked the question about 2017 versus 2016 in the macro environment and I pretty much said I thought 2017 look a lot like 2016 and still believe that is kind of the case. We're still in that kind of environment. Generally slow growth around the world at least modest level of growth, some P&C headwinds, low interest rates, business confidence that descent but fluctuates with the geopolitical cycle. So we're in – we remain in the grinded out years and we expect to have good performance in that. But we don't expect it to be one of these knock your lights out kind of thing, I mean I know that we've grown I think 14% adjusted EPS through the first six months. But really if you back out the accounting benefit of – on the compensation change is really 9%. And so I think in – we feel comfortable with that kind of level, at the level of growth that we're performing in the first half. We're expecting a little bit better in the second half and we're happy that we're now in it.
Operator: We'll go to our next question with Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thank you very much. In the new presentation of segmenting, you've added more disclosure on Consulting segment. And the Defined Benefit segment obviously was a outlier with a negative 3% growth. Can we talk about whether that's a lumpy business in general, whether you're existing low margin businesses or how should we think about that. And can you go a little bit into detail on what's in that Defined Benefit and Administration, Consulting practice?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah, I'll hand over to Julio in a second. But the Defined Benefit business, it's a terrific business, but it's not a growth business. If you think about is there a new Defined Benefit formation with companies and startups, et cetera, no. I mean basically companies today in almost every market not exclusively but certainly in the United States and in other major markets, lean heavily in the favor of Defined Contribution over Defined Benefit. And Mercer has done a really wonderful job over a number of years extracting value from our Defined Benefit practice. And – but Julio, you want to give us some more on that?
Julio A. Portalatin - Mercer Investment Management, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Dan. DBA which is the sub-segment that you're referring to is comprised primarily of our advisory and administrative services around Defined Benefit plans. And as Dan mentioned and everyone is very well aware, Defined Benefit plans are on the decreased growth many years. And while a number of plans have contracted over that time period, we have continued to maintain growth by capturing discretionary spend from advising clients to their de-risking journey. We continued to expect that clients from time-to-time, as we'll make decisions to de-risk further and we'll get some benefit from there because we are certainly leading in that space when you compare us to others in the industry. But quarter-over-quarter variances are going to happen, as we always know and depending about what our (44:20) project demand looks like such as buy-outs, cash-outs or regulatory changes, they will vacillate and that will continue to be the case. I do want to point to just one additional factor though is that we did do a restructuring that brought the wealth business together that has the Defined now in a continuum that's very important to our clients that can lead to investment consultancy opportunities as well as investment management opportunities and you saw that a little bit displayed already in that quarter when saw an 11% increase in our investment management.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Do you have anything else, Josh?
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, and I'm not trying to get guidance, but just to parse your words, would it be wrong for me to think of this over the long term as a sub-zero organic growth business?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Well, okay, define the long term. I mean clearly Defined Benefit and pension plans have a long way to run, right. These are 25 to 50 year programs as people live longer as how they operate. So, it is not a quickly declining business, and we've had many times where we have grown, but largely the growth tends to be project related work as opposed to growth in the basic business. So I would put in a category of low levels of negative growth or low levels of positive growth quarter-by-quarter but on a declining trend.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the education. Appreciate it.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah, most of my questions have been addressed. Just one last quick one. Latin America, the growth in the quarter was the slowest you've seen in a long time, I'm wondering what's happening in that market, was there anything unusual in the quarter?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: There were a couple of unusual things, but John, you want to talk about that?
John Q. Doyle - Marsh LLC: Yeah, look I think, Jay, the growth was acceptable given the volatility in the region, so we saw some ups and downs by country, we had strong results in Mexico, and I think solid results in Brazil, especially given the environment there. New business wasn't that strong, I think in part due to some of the volatility and we had some pretty strong prior year comps as well. So, weather impacted a bit of some project starts and that had an impact on new business, but broadly speaking it's – I think decent results through six months given the overall environment.
Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Focus more on the six month number as the message has been?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. That's right. I mean the Latin America is still critical market for us, when we look over a multiyear basis, it's been our fastest growing region. We don't break out geographies, but Consulting had a decent quarter in Latin America, so there is nothing fundamentally wrong. There is a – obviously there is a number of issues that individual countries are working through, but we like our positioning in Latin America, we would expect that it would return to better growth patterns in the future.
Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks for the answers.
Operator: We'll go next to Arash Soleimani with KBW.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks and good morning.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Good morning.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Just a quick question on – we hear a lot on the cyber market, their estimates out there, where premiums would go from $3 billion to $30 billion by 2020, I'm just wondering if broadly you're seeing your clients' appetites increase such that a growth level of that magnitude seems feasible.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: I don't think we're going to comment on the growth level, whether it's going to go up 10 times in the next 10 years, I think all you guys have had the experience of the exchanges to think about before we start hitting 10 times growth on any part of any of our Consulting or Risk businesses. Clearly cyber is here to stay, and around the world, tax are becoming more advanced, and therefore defenses have to be more advanced, and insurance is a good – is basically for a lot of companies, it's a package of yes, you get some risk transferred, but you also get some comparative considerations as capital providers seeking to project their capital are able to advise on best practices and some of the things that they're seeing with otherwise competing markets. And so, from that standpoint, there is a risk management quality to the insurance offering that is very beneficial to clients. And as you see around the world higher levels of disclosure requirements on breaches, I think you'll end up seeing insurance being one of the mitigants to that, but John, do you want to talk about our cyber practice a bit and what we're seeing?
John Q. Doyle - Marsh LLC: Sure, cyber risk is clearly on top of minds of our clients and has been for a number of years here in the United States and I think given some of the regulatory changes that Dan mentioned, is increasingly on top of mind for our clients outside of the U.S. So we've been adding staff and expertise and developing partnerships with firms that again go beyond insurance procurement and help them manage the risk more broadly. So it's a pretty fast growing part of our business, at a healthy growth rate, of more scale certainly here in the U.S. and relatively small and subscale outside of the United States, but we expect that to change.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah, one thing I was looking at recently and which I find interesting anyway, because you hear a lot about the insurance market, and many companies just sort of dipping their toe into cyber and concerns about accumulation risk and cyber hurricane et cetera. So let's take your $3 billion premium level, and say what's a typical rate online for cyber, it typically is less than 1%. So if you just run the math on that, there are something like $300 billion of limit that has been provided against that $3 billion of premium and in that context there is no dipping the toe in the water. There are many markets in cyber in a significant way and it's probably the growth opportunity in property and casualty.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks for those very thorough responses. Just also one other question maybe for Peter. I know Florida has been a weak spot in terms of rates on the reinsurance side. I'm just wondering, has the assignment of benefits crisis been factored into the pricing conversations at all and do you see reinsurers getting any more pricing power from the assignment of benefits crisis or is it not really a factor?
Peter C. Hearn - Guy Carpenter & Co. LLC: It's not really a factor because it's an attritional loss, it's not a catastrophic loss and most of the reinsurance in Florida is catastrophic based and not risk and attritional based.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Next question please.
Operator: We'll go to Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. But just maybe to follow up a bit on the topic of commercial insurance prices. You had mentioned the pace of commercial P&C insurance price declines have slowed a bit. Do you see any signs that that could turn positive in the next few years?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: I mean rates are geared against losses in competitive environment. There is lots of capital providers, lots of insurance companies, so there will always be some downward pressure. There's better management teams, better data and analytics and so there is not naïve underwriting like you may have seen in the 1980s or 1990s. And so there is probably a tighter range of outcomes, but it really depends on loss activity. If the loss activity comes in, it will put pressure on rates. We are seeing on the reinsurance side some slowing down, or harder to place lines of business and certainly not anything approaching a hard market in any way, shape or form on reinsurance. And usually you see reinsurance tighten before primary tightens. And so we've got a way to go here before we see that. I mean when we look at the last let's say year, maybe even two years, the UK market and the London market in particular has the deepest downdrafts in rating levels and so that is the most competitive market in the world from a price reduction standpoint. And so it's a tough place to do business these days.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Anything else, Sarah?
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's it. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Yes, thanks. Two questions here for you. First one, just on the reinsurance side, we've seen a big increase in issues of cat bonds this year. How much of a tailwind has GC Securities been to Guy Carpenter this year? And could that be an issue potentially as we look at next year on comps?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Peter, you want to take that? So basically to rephrase it, it's like, is cat bonds volume fueling 4%.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah.
Peter C. Hearn - Guy Carpenter & Co. LLC: Brian, it helps, but it hasn't been a major contributor. It's been pretty consistent in the amount of issuances that we've been involved with over the past three years.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Got you. So you haven't seen growth like the rest of the cat bond market, because cat bond market is up pretty substantially this year?
Peter C. Hearn - Guy Carpenter & Co. LLC: Well, there have been 25 cat bonds; we've placed 8, which is pretty consistent with what we've seen over the past three years.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, great. And then, Dan, my next question for you, and I imagine your regulators are pretty busy over in the UK. There's been a lot of press also on the consulting side with respect to investment consultants and the FCA report. How much is that from a revenue perspective for you guys? And any color you can add into that situation.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Well, just a little bit. One, it's an overall review of a marketplace and the dynamics of a marketplace. Then it's started out broadly on asset management including investment consultants and now it's narrowed a little bit to investment consultants in the level of concentration that there are with the largest investment consultants and what that pertains to and the potential conflicts that that could arise from that. And so, we're very much cooperating with the review, and it's obviously an important business to us, both investment consulting and investment management on a delegated basis. But, Julio, you want to talk a little bit about our business?
Julio A. Portalatin - Mercer Investment Management, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, our business has been a flagship business in that part of the world, and we anticipate that it will continue to be. We have great expertise in the space and of course, we are cooperating fully with the FCA, because we share their goals. Their goals are to ensure that we have a competitive marketplace, it's transparency that we avoid any conflicts, and then we overall maintain high standards. And that's kind of our goals, and that's how we operate in that market. And we'll continue to operate in that market in years to come. And so, now the FCA is in a determination stage, and we'll see how it goes, but wherever it goes we'll continue to cooperate, of course with them. And hopefully, give them the opportunity to also take some of our best practices and apply to the rest of the industry.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Julio. So I think we have time, operator, for one more question.
Operator: Okay. And we'll go to Adam Klauber with William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. The acquisitions that you did decent amount towards the end of the year, what does the pipeline look like right now?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: The acquisition pipeline is good. I mean we are – we look at a lot of different things, not from a detailed due diligence basis. So we've got good peripheral vision, we're live in the marketplace, so we'd have a good look across both RIS and Consulting. And I would say when we look at our pipeline, looks pretty good. We over the last three years, have spent about $1 billion in transaction value per year. It's too early to say, it's only through the first six months we've had a pretty active first six months of the year and where we look at our pipeline. And a lot these things take a long time in terms of gestation period. But so when I look at the pipeline now, this year looks pretty good and it even looks pretty good next year. We've I'm sure certain things that we're looking on right now, would take a little bit longer time. Our focus is generally on faster growing businesses and businesses that can improve our capabilities. Wouldn't mind every once in a while seems something right up the alley of our strong suit where we get some synergy and some decent earnings growth out of it through some expense saves, but our overall acquisition strategy is geared towards faster growing businesses.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC: On that P&C side, would you ever go back in the wholesale business?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Well, I don't know if there is a wholesale business anymore. I mean, clearly there is specialty placement businesses that have done quite well and they're good businesses. If you ask me if I would have preferred that we didn't exit that kind of specialty placement business. Yeah, the answer would be, I would prefer that we would have been still in that business, but when we go back in, it's a different kind of question. I mean I think they've done a very nice job, there is some good companies out there, but we're an awfully big company and we would have wanted to do something in a real minor way on an a structural basis like that. But fundamentally, we look at the wholesale business, so called wholesale business and we think they've done a nice job building out their specialties and their capabilities over a long period of time.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Glaser, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much, Mindy. And I'd like to just thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning, and I'd especially like to thank our clients for their continued support in our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. Thank you, very much.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Marsh & McLennan Companies' Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. First Quarter 2017 Financial Results and supplemental information were issued early this morning. They are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Sylvia, and good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is our CFO, Mark McGivney; Peter Zaffino, the Chairman of Risk and Insurance Services; Julio Portalatin, CEO of Mercer; Scott McDonald, CEO of Oliver Wyman; and Keith Walsh of Investor Relations. Kudos to Keith for four great years in IR. He now moves to become the CFO of RIS. So, well done, Keith. Before moving on to our results, I would like to spend a few moments on the changes the insurance industry is going through, and we'll continue to experience. As I talked about last quarter, we are living in a world of constant change and increasing complexity. While change can be disruptive, it also provides opportunity. The age of risk has only just begun. Cyber security, rising geopolitical tensions, artificial intelligence, 3D printing, robotics, water scarcity, climate change and extreme weather events are all emerging risk categories, and we could go on and on. In our view, insurance is not just about protection. It's also about enablement. Insurance plays a vital role in spurring economic growth, the taking of risk and innovation. Insurance enables commerce to thrive. Satellites are launched, skyscrapers are built, medicines are invented. The insurance industry contributes meaningfully to the advancement of society by offering freedom for the pursuit of innovation, investment, and the creation of value, along with freedom from the financial and emotional burdens of loss. Our industry has a vital role to play in risk identification, as well as assisting clients in determining which risks should be avoided entirely, and which ones can be appropriate managed. We have great respect for the insurance industry and the role insurers and reinsurers play. The winners in this dynamic environment whether broker or carrier, will be the agile. Those who focus on relentless innovation, finding the smarter way, and improving the client experience. Within MMC's risk business, we have made many changes over the last decade, pushing into new segments and geographies, building out specializations, increasing data and analytics capabilities, and hubbing our placement operations to negotiate better terms and conditions for clients, while creating efficiencies for carriers and ourselves. At Marsh & McLennan, we exist to serve clients as their trusted adviser around key risk issues. We strive to obtain broad coverage at a competitive price while improving the client experience. Over the last decade, we have seen the value of advisory services rising, while the demand for risk capital has been fairly constant even in the face of increased supply. As technology has improved, Marsh & McLennan has become more sophisticated around data and analytics, turning large amounts of information into insights to better serve clients. The insights we derive from our data create opportunities to aggregate risks in different ways that can increase efficiencies in the market. These efficiencies can come in the form of facility arrangements, contested panels, streamlined policy issuance, a more quantitative risk discussion with the clients, and access to broader pools of capital, all leading to a stronger value proposition. For example, Marsh recently launched a new insurance solution called Alternus which U.S. companies can access to cover risk in their global property portfolios. This is the first dedicated commercial insurance solution for retail clients backed by a combination of traditional and alternative capital, and includes a 7.5% premium discount off of lead pricing for clients. Developments in the industry can sometimes create areas of duplication between carriers and brokers, leading to friction along the value chain. Who should issue the policy? Who should adjudicate claims? Who takes the first notice of loss? Who does the engineering work? Tension along the value chain has always been present in the industry, not just between brokers and carriers, but amongst carriers themselves. This dynamic is inevitable if we are doing our job properly to drive value for our clients. Despite this, the relationship between carriers and brokers is strong. There's a difference between a distributor and a trusted advisor. A distributor is just a conduit that sits between a carrier and a client. And the term distributor implies they work for the carrier. In most cases, Marsh & McLennan acts as a broker. And our role is that of a trusted advisor. As a broker, we do not work for the carrier, we work for the client. Our goal is to deliver broad coverage at competitive terms and press the industry to meet rising client expectations for service and coverage. Most trusted advisors and carriers can be commoditized and disintermediated if they become complacent. We all have to prove ourselves every day by innovating and creating value. Client demand for a better user experience will only rise over time. The brokerage industry is at the front of the value chain and nobody is better positioned than Marsh & McLennan to deliver greater innovation and service for clients. We get paid in a variety of ways for the value we create. Regardless of whether we are paid by fees, commissions or some other method, it is important that our compensation is fair and transparent, and we believe it is. Broker compensation levels in the aggregate have been remarkably stable over time. Looking at U.S. property and casualty data from A.M. Best, commissions as a percent of premium have held steady in the 10% to 12% range for the last three decades. This is consistent with our recent results. For full-year 2016, Marsh placed roughly $55 billion of premium and generated revenues of $6 billion for a yield of approximately 11%, which has been relatively stable over the past several years. In a business as large and global as ours, we recognize there will be situations where we don't always get it right. And when we don't, we will act swiftly and decisively. In our role as an advocate for clients, we will continue to push for value and market efficiency. With change in the industry, there will be friction across the value chain at times. However, our bond and relationship with carriers is strong. We expect both intermediaries and carriers will be continually challenged to differentiate and add value. These are exciting times and we believe we are as well positioned as any firm to continue to thrive as our industry evolves. The world is changing fast, and we intend to be at the front of innovation in our industry. Now let me turn to our first quarter performance. MMC produced solid results in the quarter with underlying revenue growth across all four of our operating companies, margin expansion, and 17% growth in adjusted earnings per share. Total company revenue was $3.5 billion, the largest quarter in our company's history. Consolidated underlying revenue growth was 4% with excellent growth and profitability. Adjusted operating income grew 9% with 80 basis points of margin expansion. In risk and insurance services, first quarter revenue increased 6% or 5% on an underlying basis with strong performance from both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Adjusted operating income increased 10% to $600 million with the margin expanding 110 basis points to 30.2%. Consulting revenue increased 3% on both the reported and underlying basis with solid growth from both Mercer and Oliver Wyman. Adjusted operating income rose 3% to $245 million and the margin declined 10 basis points to 16.1%. While operating earnings and margin were impacted by recent M&A activity and foreign exchange, underlying results show margin expansion and earnings growth. We anticipate improvement as the year progresses and expect Consulting to deliver solid earnings growth and margin expansion for 2017. I would also like to make a few comments about the recent news regarding the UK Financial Conduct Authority. Marsh Limited, our Marsh and Guy Carpenter operating subsidiary in the UK, publicly disclosed last week that the FCA has launched a Civil Competition investigation into the Aviation Insurance and Reinsurance sector. Earlier this month, the FCA conducted an onsite inspection in Marsh Limited's office in London. The FCA indicated that it had reasonable grounds for suspecting that Marsh Limited and others have been sharing competitively sensitive information within the Aviation Insurance and Reinsurance sector. We have pledged our full and complete cooperation to the FCA and are taking this matter seriously. We are conducting our own review with the assistance of outside counsel and have asked David Batchelor, a Vice Chair of Marsh, to provide direct oversight of the Aviation Group. The FCA provided a tentative timeline indicating that its investigation would likely take a minimum of nine months. As the FCA's investigation is at an early stage, we do not intend to comment further at this time. In summary, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. In a changing and uncertain world, demand for our advice and services should continue to expand. No other organization can match Marsh & McLennan's breadth of capabilities, depth of specialization and global reach in the areas of risk, strategy and people. We continue to invest in our business for the future, while at the same time delivering consistently strong financial results. We have a deep leadership team with a proven track record and the highest quality of colleagues at every level of our organization. Looking at the remainder of 2017, we see the operating environment as broadly similar to last year, including modest global economic growth and political instability. For the full year we continue to expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, something that we have delivered for the past seven years; margin expansion across both operating segments; and strong growth in adjusted EPS. With that let me turn it over to Mark.
Mark Christopher McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Dan, and good morning. In the first quarter we delivered strong results driven by underlying revenue growth across all of our operating companies and solid margin expansion. Overall revenue was up 5% or 4% on an underlying basis. Operating income in the quarter increased 10%, while adjusted operating income was up 9%. GAAP EPS rose 20% to $1.09 and adjusted EPS increased 17% to $1.08, including an $0.08 per share benefit from adopting the new accounting standard for share-based compensation. Looking at Risk & Insurance Services, first quarter revenue was $2 billion, with strong underlying growth of 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 10% to $600 million, with our margin expanding 110 basis points to 30.2%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 7%, including contribution from the recent acquisitions of Bluefin and J. Smith Lanier. On an underlying basis, Marsh's revenue increased 5%. In the international division underlying growth was 5%. EMEA was up 3%, Asia Pacific rose 11%, and Latin America grew 7%. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was also 5%, the strongest level of growth since the first quarter of 2012. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $385 million, an increase of 3% or 4% on an underlying basis, driven by growth in the U.S., Asia Pacific and specialties. Guy Carpenter's strong performance continues its track record of growth in the face of industry headwinds. Both Marsh and Guy Carpenter produced strong first quarter underlying growth. And we are pleased with the results. As we've said in the past, it is best to look at performance over a full year as opposed to focusing too much on any one quarter. You may recall in 2016, Marsh produced 3% underlying revenue growth with quarterly growth ranging from 2% to 5%, while Guy Carpenter delivered 2% growth for the year with quarterly growth ranging from 0% to 3%. Given the better than expected first quarter top-line results, we would not be surprised if growth was tempered in the second quarter, resulting in modest margin improvement in RIS in Q2. Our outlook for the full year has not changed. And we continue to expect strong earnings growth and solid margin improvement in RIS for 2017. In the Consulting segment, revenue of $1.5 billion was up 3% on both a reported and underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 3% to $245 million, while the margin declined 10 basis points to 16.1%. As Dan stated, the near-term impact of recent acquisitions and foreign exchange was a headwind to Consulting earnings growth and margin in the quarter. Underlying trends in the business are good. And we continue to expect solid operating earnings growth and margin expansion in Consulting for the full year with momentum building through the second half of 2017. Mercer's revenue increased 4% in the quarter to $1.1 billion, and was up 3% on an underlying basis. As part of the restructuring we discussed last quarter, Mercer established a Wealth business reflecting a unified client strategy for its formal Retirement and Investments businesses. Wealth is comprised of two primary practices, Defined Benefit Consulting & Administration, and Investment Management & Related Services. Additionally, going forward, we are referring to the talent business as Career. So, Mercer will be oriented around three lines of business; Health, Wealth, and Career. To help with your modeling, we've provided additional information in the supplemental schedules of our press release. Underlying growth in Mercer was solid across the board. Wealth was up 3% in the quarter. Within Wealth, Defined Benefit Consulting & Administration was flat, and Investment Management & Related Services increased 9%. Our delegated asset management business continues to show strong growth with assets under management of $177 billion at quarter-end, an increase of 12% from year-end 2016. Health increased 2% despite continued softness in the U.S. project work related to uncertainty around the Affordable Care Act. This was a nice improvement from the fourth quarter. Career grew 7% with continued strong momentum in work day implementation, an area that has benefited from our acquisition last year of CPSG, a leading workday services partner. This is just one example of how we are improving our business mix and growth profile through ongoing acquisitions and investments. Oliver Wyman revenue increased 2% to $449 million. Underlying growth was 4%, a solid result given the challenging comparison to 15% growth in the first quarter of 2016. Investment income was de minimis in the first quarter, compared with a loss of $3 million in the first quarter of last year. We continue to expect a minimal contribution from investment income in 2017. As we anticipated on last quarter's call, foreign exchange was a slight negative in the quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect a slight FX headwind in the second quarter and minimal impact in the back half of the year. Our adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was 23.3%, compared with 28.5% in the first quarter of last year. As I noted earlier, the tax provision in the first quarter of 2017 includes an $0.08 per share benefit from the change in accounting for share-based compensation. We expect the impact of the accounting change will be felt primarily in the first quarter of each year, which is when most of our equity awards vest. Excluding this item, our adjusted tax rate was 29.1%, and we continue to expect a 29% tax rate for the remainder of 2017, excluding any impact from this accounting change or other discrete items that could have either a positive or negative impact. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $5.9 billion, compared with $4.8 billion at year-end. In January, we issued $1 billion of senior notes, comprised of $500 million due in 2022 and $500 million due in 2047. We repaid $250 million of senior notes on April 1st. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us flexibility with modest near-term repayment obligations. Our next scheduled debt repayment is not until the fourth quarter of 2018 when we have $250 million of notes maturing. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $930 million, with approximately $142 million in the U.S. Uses of cash in the first quarter included $200 million for share repurchases, $175 million for dividends and $457 million for acquisitions. For the full year 2017, we continue to expect to deploy capital in line with the level in 2016 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. We expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividend per share by double digits. Overall, the first quarter represents a strong start to the year, and we are on track to deliver a solid performance in 2017. As Dan said, for the full year, we continue to expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion in both segments, and strong growth in adjusted EPS. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, sir. We will now take our first question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. The line is open.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. I was hoping to get a little bit more color on what drove the growth really within RIS in both Marsh and Guy Carpenter in the quarter? If you can just talk to what you're seeing in terms of the economy as well as new business growth in the quarter. And I know you guys had commented that we would potentially see lower growth in the second quarter. Was that due to some business I guess shifting between the two quarters?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. So, good question, Elyse. I'll take it to be begin with, and then I'll hand over to Peter to give you some more detail. But so on the macro factors first. Not much has really changed, right? The environment globally is still pretty tough. So, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We're actually doing very well in the environment that we see. But there is still only modest levels of global economic growth. I've seen some of the predictions that sort of said, globally, it might be more like a 3.5% as opposed to a 3%. But there's an awful lot of political instability still out there and the lack of clarity in certain countries. And so, I think what it demonstrates in part is the resilience of the risk and insurance industry. It's a requirement, right? Companies at all levels, even governments, have to address the risk that they face, and we're well positioned to advise them on that. But, I would say, on a macro basis, not much that helps us, but really these remain the grind it out years, and Peter and his team and all the colleagues at RIS are doing a great job grinding out growth. So, this is two nice quarters in a row, but we've cautioned and we caution you about the second quarter is that – in this business, it's better to look at rolling four years or full years as opposed to any individual quarter. But, Peter, what can you add to that?
Peter Zaffino - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Dan. Let me just talk a little bit about the first quarter. We're really pleased with the results and how we started out the year. It was, as you saw in the reported results, real balanced growth throughout the full globe and U.S. and Canada division up 5%, international up 5%. We're particularly happy to see strong results in Continental Europe and Asia. This is both their largest quarter of the year, and I think that's a little bit of context as to why we don't see the run rate going in the second quarter is that seasonally, CE and Asia had their biggest quarters and had really strong growth in the first quarter. So, we're pleased with that. New business was exceptional, and that was contributions across our international, as well as the U.S. and Canada. We saw strong contributions from the core U.S. brokerage business with strong new business and MMA continued its very strong performance in terms of driving top-line growth. We had fewer headwinds in some of the geographies. We've called out Canada in the past. We've called out Australia, New Zealand, they were less headwinds in the quarter, and we saw some modest organic growth and so that was a contribution. Rate declines were very similar to what I said in prior quarters. They tempered a bit, but they were still a modest headwind. But as Dan said, there was some exposure growth and we saw some economic growth to offset that a bit. So, overall, it was a really strong start to the year. We're really pleased and again, the range that we've given in the past the 3% to 5% is what we expect for the full year.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Absolutely.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up, in terms of Guy Carpenter, the growth there has been strong, except in the first quarter we've seen a lot of pricing headwinds in that business. I know you guys have made some key hires over the past year or so. Do you think – are you guys taking share in the reinsurance space? What are you specifically seeing within Guy Carpenter and how do you see the growth there as we think about the rest of 2017?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I'll start with that, and then I'll hand over to Peter. I mean in the overall sense of things, I would say over the last several years it's undoubtable that Guy Carpenter has taken some share. They have grown underlying revenue 24 out of the last 25 quarters. And so, that is a good comparison to the competitive set. And the reinsurance business has expanded a great deal, so it's not about a transaction anymore. There's a lot more value that a reinsurance broker delivers to their clients than ever before. But Peter, you want to describe that a little bit more.
Peter Zaffino - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure, Dan. Guy Carpenter got off to a great start, really strong first quarter with 4% organic growth. That's on top of 3% in the prior year in the first quarter. Some really positive signs to start the year. I'll start with its leader. I mean, Peter Hearn is relentless on client advocacy, value and making sure that we're trying to do everything we can to drive new business and a keen focus on grabbing share. When I look at some of the contributions within the quarter, the U.S. had a terrific start to the year, new business expanding from current clients as well as really strong retention. We've called out global specialties and particularly the retro unit had a really strong growth in new business and we had good new business and contribution from Asia as well. So, it was really balanced. Again, the core fundamentals are really strong. Good new business, good retention and growing our share with our current clients. So, overall, really positive way to start the year.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: And obviously, we're all pleased with it, but I would reiterate that you should be looking at longer stretches of time than one or two quarters strung together when you evaluate this business because the business itself is very geared towards global GDP, P&C pricing et cetera. The next question please.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Larry Greenberg from Janney. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is open.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Thank you and good morning. So, just following up on the strong Marsh growth, and in particular, U.S., Canada. Would you characterize the relative contributions between agency and the core brokerage as any different in the quarter relative to recent quarters?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: I'll hand off to Peter. We don't go into details about MMA, other than to say – in most circumstances, they have been outgrowing the core brokerage business of Marsh, which was our expectation when we started down this path in 2008. I think it's fair to say that most of the cylinders with Marsh have been performing pretty well. But Peter?
Peter Zaffino - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: I largely agree Dan. MMA has had very strong consistent contribution to the U.S. and Canada division. But as I've said in my sort of broader remarks of Marsh, we saw a terrific new business in the core U.S. brokerage business. Canada had strong new business. They were a contributor. And we're also – while they are a small portion of the total, we're seeing strong performance from Dovetail torn (28:50). Some of the seeds that we planted for strategic investments in the past, having double-digit growth. And so, our momentum in U.S. and Canada was encouraging. Again, I will just caution, we're more in the sort 3% to 5% range and feel like we just had a really strong start to the year.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Great. Thanks. And then, maybe for Julio. Under the new Wealth line – I mean, is Defined Benefit Consulting and Administration, is that a business that could grow given the environment today?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Julio, you want to...
Julio A. Portalatin - Mercer Investment Management, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. Thank you, Larry. Let me just take a step back and level set a bit about the wealth business, and then I'll get specific to your question on the Defined Benefit Consulting Administration. So creating a wealth business reflects very importantly how our clients want to do business with us, and that's why we did it. And we've simplified the business so that we can have an ease of decision making between the retirement and the investment business, which is basically managing the pension assets, and of course, matching assets and liabilities at the time. And we see that as a whole value proposition, and that's as important to create this wealth business in response to those demands of our clients. We are breaking out the revenue as you mentioned for wealth to provide a better insight into the underlying growth dynamics of the business. So the more mature aspects of the business, meaning the DB, the consultancy and the benefit administration, as you mentioned, will be called Defined Benefit Consulting Administration or DBA. That business quite frankly, is significantly part of what was previously the retirement actuarial business. And we know that for many years now, we've been living in a world of plus or minus flat in that business, and I would expect that that's the kind of role we'll continue to see as we move forward in that line. Now of course, the Investment Management and related services business or the IMS business includes the faster and higher growth rate business, which is primarily in our delegated solutions, our defined contribution related investment services and also financial wellness. So while IMS can be seen as a proxy for our investment work, it also encompasses other business opportunities. So you'll see that being somewhere aligned with what we saw the investment business before.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Julio. Next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey. Thanks. My first question, I guess just thinking about the EMEA organic. If we were to just drill down to the UK, has that been growing at a faster rate than overall EMEA or a slower rate?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: We're not going to break out the UK relative to EMEA. EMEA has grown consistently over a long stretch of time. The UK obviously is a big chunk of that region. But we can go down a rabbit hole, Ryan, of – if we start talking about individual breakouts, then we really have to do it on a consistent basis, and it's just not worth it. So what's your other question?
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So my other question was, I guess just overall thinking about margins. One thing I noticed was that it looked like depreciation and intangible asset amortization ticked up this quarter. And I'm wondering if that's a good run rate to use going forward? Because it looked like that might have had somewhat of an impact on margins, especially in Consulting? Thanks.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Ryan. Mark, do you want to take that?
Mark Christopher McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Ryan, it did tick up. And that's just a function of we closed quite a number of transactions late last year and early this year. Of course it's uncertain. It depends on activity we do this year. But that's a decent run rate to use for the quarters for this year.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thank you. First, congrats to both Keith and Dan for their new roles. Dan, thank you so much for the thoughtful sort of remarks. I just want to follow up on that to say, as a trust adviser have you had a discussion with your clients? And what's their view on the rising tension between the brokers and the underwriters?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Well, to begin with I really don't think that there is a rising tension between brokers and underwriters. I think this is a symptom of a soft market environment and that we've lived through it for a while. What I can tell you is that there's rising tension between underwriters. And so we help manage through that. In our major markets we absolutely go beyond regulatory requirements in terms of our disclosure to clients. I mean we're quite adept at giving them the details for them to make determinations as to how we should be compensated and what level we are compensated. Clients in terms of – clients are largely the beneficiary and will continue to be the beneficiary of the super abundance of capital in the insurance marketplace. And so what we're trying to do at Marsh & McLennan is to focus more on expanded coverage at competitive prices, as opposed to a continual race to the bottom with narrow product, which is price driven. And so our view is that the insurance industry is overly focused on current risks and not focused enough in broadening our offerings. That's not only on catastrophe exposures but other kinds of exposures. So we should as an industry focus more on risk and solving risk questions as opposed to narrowly looking at insurance.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. My follow-up is on the Oliver Wyman. It looks like the first quarter organic growth, very strong, relatively to very tough comp in the first quarter of last year. Maybe Scott can comment on that?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Sure. I don't want to say it surprised us as much as it surprised you, but I know we've been talking about their terrific first quarter in 2016 a lot. And we thought this quarter would be around flat, but they did better. So, Scott, you want to talk a little bit about that?
Scott McDonald - Oliver Wyman Group: Sure, Dan. Kai, we were pretty happy with the quarter, the 4% growth, especially in light of the 15% growth last year. And it was driven by pretty broad-based strength across the portfolio. Regionally, North America was strong as we expected it to be. International, particularly our Middle Eastern businesses were even stronger than expected and the performance there was great. And the weakest part of our portfolio regionally is Europe, which is a little slower. And then by industry, we saw real strength in health, public sector, our actuarial businesses, our transportation businesses, our manufacturing business. And even our very large financial services business was also ahead of plan for the year. And they had a spectacular first quarter last year. So there's no change in our annual and medium term target growth of mid to high single digits. We're still confident in that as the target. And at the moment we still continue to see demand across most sectors, most regions. The demand feels reasonable. It's supported by continued light economic growth across the world, although there is still a great deal of uncertainty out there.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you. Thanks, Scott.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: So our next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Styblo from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Hi there. Good morning and thanks for the questions. Congrats on the quarter, guys. I wanted to come back to the margins too, in the RIS segment especially, those being up 110 basis points. I think that's about the fourth straight quarter where you guys are expanding over 100 basis points. So getting a pretty good trend line there. And I think that's perhaps above the maybe 50 basis points to 100 basis points that it seems to be sustainable, which you guys have sort of talked about in the past. But I'm curious if there's just any unusual benefits in the quarter or easier comps last year that we should be mindful of. I know the pension savings is going to be a tailwind this year, not sure if that sort of was front-end loaded in the quarter. So if you could elaborate on that. As well as Guy Carpenter's strength was obviously important in the quarter. But does that help – I think that's your highest margin business, so does that also help margins immediately? Or does that have a little bit longer tail effect, the way the bookings happen in that business?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I'll hand off to Peter to give you some specifics. But I just want to reiterate that when we look at margins, we always advise people to look over longer stretches of time in all of our businesses. One quarter does not really arrive at any – you shouldn't arrive at any conclusions for one quarter. Certainly when we're growing at a level like 4% and 5%, as we did in Guy Carpenter and Marsh, margin expansion is more of a given than in shorter quarters. But if you look over the last number of years in RIS, yes, last year, it was a very strong margin expansion year. The year before that was 90 bps and the year before that was 30 bps. The year before that, that was 150 bps. And so, I wouldn't look at the average and say, well, that's what it's going to be at all times. It's going to move around a little bit. We're focused on the long term. We're not overly focused on margins in our business, we're more focused on growth of both revenue and earnings. But Peter?
Peter Zaffino - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Dan. And I think you have largely said how we think about the long term. But if I go into the quarter – as you mentioned, we expanded our margin 110 basis points. There's a couple of things that went on. As Dan has mentioned in the past, and as I have in terms of what we do in terms of what we're driving within the business, just focusing on underlying organic top line growth being very disciplined as a management team on the expenses and driving earnings growth. And therefore, the margin does improve. So, we had a little bit of outperformance on the top line. And so that, really, was the biggest contributor to the margin expansion. As I mentioned earlier that in Europe and in Asia, those are their seasonally largest quarters, and so they had outperformance while we had straight line expenses we had a little bit more revenue pop from those regions that drove a little bit more expansion in the margin. And we created a little bit of bandwidth for the first quarter and the latter part of 2016 that helped the run rate. And so overall, I would look at really what Dan said as take a look at the long term, this is not the run rate from the first quarter, but those variables really contribute to having strong margin expansion.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Peter. You have something else, Dave?
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Yeah. Just on the follow up, so Dan, you had mentioned about the commission rates over the last three decades or so, and then specifically your performance hovering in that 10% to 12% range being stable. I'm curious, are there ways or levers to nudge that up a little bit, given the strong analytics and differentiated services and data that you provide to your customers where maybe you help them save a little bit more money than they could, but you're able to generate a little bit higher commission for doing that. And ultimately, it produces the higher yield. I'm just thinking in this environment where data and analytics is so important, is that going to become increasingly a value that customers appreciate and perhaps allow you to nudge the commission rate a little bit higher over time?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Well, our view is creating additional value for clients. That's what our focus is on. And in doing that, as we create additional value and perform additional services, we would get remunerated more from clients on those kind of occasions. We want to be fair and transparent with all parties. Our objective is not to drive more commission volume out of insurance companies as a way for us to do better. It's actually to increase our value to in things as you mentioned, like data and analytics and other things where we create value, where we can get revenue streams from that additional value. But we would rather be expanding the pie for the value we create than negotiating greater proportions of that pie from the insurance carriers.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Got it. Very helpful.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Next question, please. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, ma'am. Your line is open.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks very much for the comments at the beginning of the call, and I appreciate you won't comment further on the FCA investigation. But I was hoping maybe you could just help us understand, does the aviation business operate structurally different than other businesses? Because we read in the press that insurers will know prices for all different layers in aviation, but that's not the case in other businesses, and I didn't know if you could just help us understand if there's some structural difference there.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Sarah. And I do appreciate not digging in to try to get information from an investigation that is ongoing. I mean, we really do want to respect the FCA's process and not comment further at this time. So, I'll give you a general comment with regard to the aviation market because it has been talked about quite expansively in the press. It is a different market than other markets, particularly in London, and one of the reasons that the aviation market is a pretty competitive market is that it is what's called verticalized, which means, typically, a lead price is negotiated between the broker and the lead underwriter, and then the broker goes to individual following markets who all bid for their share of the account, generally offering a discount against the lead price, and so that's how it's developed. It's quite different than the subscription model in the rest of the property and casualty market where the lead develops terms and then the following markets write a share of those terms but generally get the same terms as the lead. So, it is a structurally different market.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Any other follow-up?
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: No, that's it. Thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. Thanks. A couple of quick ones here. First, I just want to follow up on Larry's question. Mr. Julio, on the benefits consulting administration area. I'm just curious with the, call it, very slow growth, how does the Benefits Administration Business kind of fit in to the overall picture here and one of your peers is getting out of that business. Does it make sense to be in that business? How does it fit?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: I'll comment a little bit and then I'll hand off to Julio. I mean, that is – the ben admin business, number one, is not a separate business for us. It is an integrated business that is linked with what we provide in terms of either the retirement business or the health and benefit business. So, it's not separate and distinct. And we haven't tried to grow it as a separate and distinct business. So, it's not a large business that we're managing. It's part of a service that we offer as part of other higher valued offerings. So, it's integrated. But Julio, you want to talk a little bit more?
Julio A. Portalatin - Mercer Investment Management, Inc.: Thanks, Dan. That's pretty much right on in terms of how we manage the business. You might recall that several quarters ago, we actually made a decision to put that business strategically aligned with the business that it was deploying, whether it was health or it was a DB business in the retirement business, and thus, it is kind of integrated now in many ways. But let me also say that we consistently evaluate our portfolio. We've been doing that for years now. We disinvest and have disinvested selectively in targeted offerings or different types of solutions over time, which do not meet our return goals and we've proven that time and time again. You may recall that in the past, we repositioned our outsourcing. It was call then outsourcing business with a focus on profitable revenue growth and that's only on top-line. So, we sold for example our Canadian recordkeeping business some time ago. We most recently sold our U.S. DC (45:48) administration recordkeeping business as well, and those are just examples of where we're continuously looking at where the business is going and how we want to invest and creating rooms to do that by disinvesting in some other things. So, it continues to support some of our businesses and as it does, we will continue to work through having it as part of the offering, because we think our clients see it as being important, but we always reserve the right in the disciplined fashion of disinvest to invest to be reviewing that business over time.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thanks. And then my second quick question. I found it really interesting when I saw the reports about the formation of Alternus with Nephila. I'm just curious, Dan and Peter could you talk a little bit about what's your view is with respect to alternative capital penetrating the primary insurance market and will that be something that continues to grow here, is that a growth area for you? It seems like it's an attractive type of venture for Marsh.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Sure, Peter, you want to take that?
Peter Zaffino - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure, Dan. Thanks. Thanks, Brian. Dan mentioned sort of the – sort of structure and what the launch was in his opening comments. Let me just take a step back on this as to why we arrived at is that we think that bringing new insurance solutions, being creative, being innovative of bringing high rate of traditional capital like Allianz, very well respected insurance company combined with alternative capital with Nephila that's been in the business mostly on the reinsurance side for the better part of a decade, they understand the business really well. To focus on U.S. property risks was bringing a solution and value to our clients. So, we have been making investments in a variety of different trends that we see in the business. But in particular, I've mentioned before, around data, distribution and capital. The investments we've made over the past five years in driving richer data, better analytic capabilities, enhancing the sophistication of the conversation we're having with clients, not only in the global risk management space, but also in the middle market, has been an evolution in terms of our value. And our clients are looking for that in terms of more demand. So, thinking about packaging risk with this innovation – of again, driving in more enablement for alternative capital gets the primary mark in a thoughtful way is something that we thought would be well received. And most recently, at RIMS, that was validated. I think increasing efficiency for our shared and layered placements at a discounted price, expanding towards the security, having more of a long-term nature for our clients, those are all things that they responded very favorable to. So, I mean, I can't really predict how big it's going to be or how much it's going to expand. But I know that the current discussions have been incredibly well received.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. It would be, I think, helpful for us if you could give us any update you received from the RIMS Conference this week in Philadelphia, either marketing conditions or customer buying trends?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. I'll start with that. Unfortunately, I probably have to do the whole answer because Mr. Zaffino was in London, as opposed to RIMS, at our request. But ultimately – I mean, RIMS is a fantastic event. It had something like 10,000 to 12,000 people attending this year. I get very proud of the organization when I go into the Marsh Café, which is the size of about two or three football fields, and it's filled up with between 300 and 900 people from 9:00 in the morning till 5:00 in the afternoon. Most of the conversation at RIMS has to do with issues around the insurance market, and where it's likely to go from here. There's general consensus that there is a lot of capital. So, can that capital be used in ways that can provide benefits to where clients are looking or seeking additional coverages? I think cyber is a good example. You go a decade ago and cyber exposure existed, but it generally wasn't transferred, and the market was very tentative around providing cyber coverage. And now you look and there's a significant amount of cyber capacity, and more and more clients are interested in looking at cyber or hiring brokers and underwriters not only to transfer risks but to help them evaluate their exposures and to give them some type of comparative commentary because insurers see so many different programs, they can help evaluate best practices between companies. And so the insurance industry is a tremendous value in managing risk and not just transferring it. Another example, there was a lot of talk around M&A, and the way the industry has increased its capability to essentially write warranty and reps types of insurance coverage that used to be the purview of only two or three carriers. Now there's many carriers who are willing to consider that. And so more and more companies now look to the insurance industry as a way to protect themselves against different views around an M&A transaction. So that's just a couple of things. But there wasn't a huge amount of new news at RIMS. The market's pretty stable. There's downward trends in terms of pricing. And that was kind of it. But anything else, Jay?
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. There have been media reports suggesting that a key Marsh Mac executive could join AIG's next CEO at that company. Would you have any comment on this issue, including MMC's executive succession planning process?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. There's a couple of things. I mean I think media reports is being kind, considering there was no named source within any of these so-called media reports. I mean I think it tends to be rumor mongering that just goes around and feeds off of itself. But as I look around this table, we have the best leadership team in the industry. Period. So it doesn't surprise me at all that when there are senior level openings at other companies, there will always be speculation about people who are MMC executives. It comes with the territory. And I'm glad to take it, because it's a small price to pay for having the best talent. Next question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. I would like to get a little more detail on the wealth segment re-reporting. Is there a plan different from the basic plan to improve margins through cost rationalization by combining these two businesses? Or is it merely a reporting element that we're seeing?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: I'll hand it off to Julio in a second. But it's definitely not just a reporting element. The way we look at the business, is our retirement business advises a dramatic level of pension funds and deals with the – essentially the liabilities that a company has with regard to their defined benefit pension programs. And our investment business largely deals with the assets and ways of helping clients make decisions about how they deal with the asset side to match up against those liabilities. So it seemed to us to be a natural progression to try to create more linkage between these businesses and more commonality in terms of management structure, et cetera. But, Julio, you want to take that further?
Julio A. Portalatin - Mercer Investment Management, Inc.: Yes. Yes. Thanks, Dan. Part of our approach to disciplined execution is to constantly challenge ourselves in how we best serve our clients. And this is all about client centricity and being able to find further avenues of growth and improved profitability. And we made a number of changes with regard to our structure to do that. And one of them was creating a wealth business by combining – or by maximizing the strength of our retirement value proposition and our investments. And these are realities of how our clients want to do business with us, making decisions on managing and providing retirement benefits to employees in ways that cut across these two businesses. So we've made it easier to do business with. And more broadly, we want to provide a simplified and faster decision making process to ultimately be able to, yes, promote growth.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So ultimately – yeah, just I got one more. So we should expect this could possibly be a help to growth? And in that case, margins, but there's no explicit margin anticipated improvement coming from this transition?
Julio A. Portalatin - Mercer Investment Management, Inc.: We will see how it continues to work through all of the different avenues of feedings. Remember, as Dan mentioned, we have a very large book of business that sits on the advisory side of the equation, which is on the retirement side. And we've been moving it through the continuum to eventually be able to do investment, consultancy and delegated solutions. To the extent that that might be easier to do, we might be able to promote more growth. Time will tell if that happens. And no question, we also would like to see profitability also benefit from that over time. And we'll see if that pans out as time goes on.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: But it's fair to say the combination was done more around client delivery and the potential for growth in the future as opposed to expense synergy.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. And again, congratulations to Dan Farrell and Keith Walsh.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Josh. Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Good morning and congrats on the quarter. Just maybe a little M&A update, what you bought in the quarter and where it fits? And if there's been any change in your view on what you're looking to buy and sell?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Well, considering I'm looking at Mr. McGivney and he has been lonely on this call. Mark, do you want to talk about that a little bit?
Mark Christopher McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Dan. So we're off to a strong start for M&A. If you'll remember back to this time last year, we had pretty minimal spending in the first quarter. So as I said, we deployed $457 million to acquisitions in the first quarter. The largest we closed – four transactions, they were all in MMA, the largest of which was J. Smith Lanier by far. And as I said, we hope to continue to deploy capital in line with the level that we had in 2016. And our hope is that we'll see a nice balance and a nice healthy amount of M&A. So the pipeline continues to be good and no real change in our appetite
Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Has the competition from private equity changed much? I was looking at recent data that showed that there's just an enormous amount of money at sort of unprecedented levels for money to be put to work in private equity in general. But I don't know if – the devil's in the details. If it's truly a more competitive market because of that or not in brokerage.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. The answer, Paul, is yes. I mean ultimately, private equity has been a participant in the – in particular in the brokerage space for many years now. And has been successful because it's actually a terrific business in terms of high cash generation, generally low levels of risk, recurring revenue, et cetera. So it really is a great business for all of us, including private equity. And so it's attracted other PE. And undoubtedly over the last several years, five years or six years, there has been multiple creep, which means that everyone's got to be a little bit more careful when they're looking at pro forma kind of tabulations, et cetera. I think we're a little bit different. We're a little bit different because we generally don't compete with private equity because in our build of Marsh & McLennan agency, the focus is building the highest quality agency in the United States and attract like-minded individuals who have the same dream in their minds, as opposed to some companies that are looking to just optimize their cash payout, and they're not really concerned what happens to their business or to their colleagues in the future because the one thing you know about private equity, it's not permanent capital. Whereas we're in the business to stay. And so, generally, if we're talking to a company in the agency space, and they have not decided whether they want to go with us or private equity, well it's not a company for us. So, generally, our competitor in this space, more often than not, is whether they stay private not another competitor in the industry or private equity.
Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Great. Thanks. Thanks, folks.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicholas Mezick from KBW. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Mezick - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi first, I wanted to congratulate you guys on the recent hire in Investor Relations. Quick question, in your prepared remarks, you said advisors and carriers can be commoditized and disintermediated. Outside of QSG, can you expand on what technology changes Marsh is invested in? And I have a quick follow-up.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah, I'll start with that. I mean, I think we all have to recognize that digital disruption and disintermediation is broiling all industries, right? And so, the insurance industry is not going to be immune in any way toward having to step up, focus on digitization and innovation as a key way of going forward. Now, I want our people to feel secure in their jobs with Marsh & McLennan but insecure about our position in the marketplace. We're constantly striving to find a smarter way to innovate, to create, to strive, to develop. And we actually believe that our culture is geared towards creating additional client value and we have a real history of innovating in order to do that. But it's fair to say – and the reason I mentioned the potential for disintermediation of either party, is that our industry remains inefficient in many parts of the customer value chain. And I mean – and that ranges from basic policy, policy issuance, to claims management, et cetera. So, we see great promise in technology and digital innovation as a way to address some of the challenges in our industry. And it's not just – I want to say, broadly, it's not just in risk and insurance services. In our Consulting division, we have a lot of activity around digital, as well. So, it's a – we'll take this as the last call. But let me go to Peter a little bit, and then maybe to Julio and Scott, just for some brief comments. But I'm cognizant of the fact that we've run over time a little bit. So, let's just give it a minute or so each. So, Peter, you want to start?
Peter Zaffino - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure, Dan. Just to add to what you said. I mean, Marsh really has a four part digital strategy. First, is enhancing the client experience. The second is use of data and analytics. Third, is an improved internal workflow. And then, the last one, which you've seen with Dovetail, is leading acceleration of the change in the small commercial market. I mean, I won't go into detail on each, but when you look at data and analytics and the advancements we've made in terms of what I mentioned before, data capability on analytics of delivering superior value, not only on analyzing risk, but giving our clients a lot more insight in terms of how they should be thinking about risk. We've launched advancements on iMAP, which is now mobile for us. PlaceMAP, which helps our colleagues place business in the insurance market more efficiently. And I'll give you one statistic where we've used data and analytics as part of the process during the RFP. Our win ratio when using that methodology has increased 50% in terms of new business. So, I think that's a big contributor to why we're being able to drive more new business.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Peter. Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin - Mercer Investment Management, Inc.: Our digital strategy is similar to how Peter mentioned it – is really centered around enhancing our client experience as much as we possibly can and bringing new solutions to our clients in ways that embraces and enhances the consultants' differentiation with their clients as they look to do service and deliver. We have several examples of that in the way we are developing new solutions, whether it's in a partnership format with Mercer Wise 401(k) or it's an acquisition like Thompsons Online, which is really a digital global-based SaaS technology play that allows us to have a leading provider of global benefits management through their cloud-based technology platform and it is allowed to complement Mercer in the global benefits management space. This market is evolving rapidly with clients and demanding a bundled broker solution and a digital solution. Quite frankly, it's global. So that consultancy and technology, marrying of those two really gives us some competitive advantage as we go forward and you're going to see us I think in this space look at all whether it's partnerships or acquisitions to be able to enhance our digital experience with our client and be able to grow in that space as time goes on.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Julio. Scott if you can just be brief and bring us home.
Scott McDonald - Oliver Wyman Group: Very quickly from me. At Oliver Wyman, we serve all the industries that are being disrupted, so having a view, advice and tools to support them as they transform is essential. So, we're making big investments in our data capabilities, our analytics capabilities. We do most of this through a business we call Oliver Wyman Labs and we will continue to build and buy fairly aggressively to do that.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Scott and I'm going to call it a day right now. So, I thank all of your for joining us on the call this morning. I thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. Have a good day.
Operator: Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that will now conclude today's conference call. Thank you very much for your participation today. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Marsh & McLennan Companies’ Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. Fourth quarter 2016 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the Company’s website at www.mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements.  For a more detailed discussion of these factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule on today’s earnings release. I will now turn this call over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Please go ahead.
Dan Glaser: Thank you, Derek. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I am Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is our CFO, Mark McGivney; Peter Zaffino, the Chairman of Risk and Insurance Services; Julio Portalatin, CEO of Mercer; Scott McDonald, CEO of Oliver Wyman; and Keith Walsh, Head of Investor Relations. I recently returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos. For the 12th consecutive year, the WEF released its annual global risk report, which was prepared with the support of Marsh & McLennan Companies and other partners. The report highlights the social and political risks that crystallized around the world in 2016 and examined some of their root causes, which include income and wealth disparity, a fraught geopolitical environment and disruptive technological change. The year also saw significant volatility in financial markets – Brexit, continued terrorist activity and a rising populism that challenges some of the basic tenets of capitalism and globalization. We are certainly living in an age of VUCA, an acronym that stands for volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. The complexity, quantity and speed of information today make it difficult for countries, companies and individuals to understand both risk and opportunity. For example, new technologies such as artificial intelligence are creating challenges from both a technological and governance standpoint. The cyber security landscape is likely to broaden to include critical infrastructure and governments in many parts of the world are less stable and perhaps less functional than previously thought. But there is also a silver lining. Technology is transforming the lives of billions of people for the better and will continue to play a vital role in promoting global prosperity. Productivity and quality of life are measurably up in most corners of the world and healthcare innovation is providing new medical solutions that allow people to enjoy longer and healthier lives. This is an extreme case of best of times, worst of times. It is the best time for those who are agile and innovate. At the same time, the pace of innovation is creating new risks, ones that will be amplified if companies are on the wrong side of social, political and environmental issues. The challenges are daunting, but there is more opportunity than ever before and our clients need advice and solutions around the globe. We continue to execute a simple yet effective strategy to be a trusted advisor around the issues of risk, strategy and people. With this backdrop, we see strong demand for our services. Marsh & McLennan Companies is positioned for long-term growth and our competitive advantages will be put to good use. Now let’s discuss our performance. We capped off another excellent year with a strong fourth quarter, which Mark will discuss in more detail. In the fourth quarter, we produced underlying revenue growth of 3% on a consolidated basis, including 5% growth in RIS and 2% growth in consulting. We also delivered double-digit growth and adjusted EPS, driven by higher operating income with strong margin expansion. In terms of our full-year performance, MMC had an excellent year delivering underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both segments and strong growth in adjusted EPS. At the same time, we continue to keep our annual commitments to shareholders, to increase dividends per share by double digits and to reduce our total shares outstanding. And we continue to grow the firm through acquisitions, building our market position, capabilities, client services and geographic footprint. Looking at our 2016 results in more detail, consolidated revenue exceeded $13 billion with underlying revenue up 3%. Underlying revenue growth was balanced with both the risk and insurance services and consulting segments rising 3%. Within RIS, underlying revenue growth was 3% at Marsh and 2% at Guy Carpenter. 2016 marks Marsh’s sixth straight year of underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range. Despite rate and other pressures faced in recent years by reinsurance brokers, Guy Carpenter has produced underlying revenue growth every year since 2009, a solid achievement. Within consulting, both Mercer and Oliver Wyman delivered underlying revenue growth of 3%. Mercer’s consistent record of underlying revenue growth between 3% and 4% continued for the sixth straight year. Oliver Wyman finished the year strong overcoming a challenging third quarter. MMC continues to generate positive operating leverage as adjusted operating income rose 10% to $2.7 billion in 2016. Our adjusted margin increased 140 basis points, our ninth consecutive year of margin improvement. Similar to our revenue growth, margin expansion was balanced across the segments with RIS rising 140 basis points to 24.7% and consulting up 130 basis points to 18.6%. As we have said many times, we do not have a margin target. We view margin expansion as a natural outcome of managing the business properly to grow revenue and earnings. EPS on both a GAAP and adjusted basis increased by double digits. GAAP EPS rose 13% to $3.38 and adjusted EPS increased 12% to a record $3.42. Since 2009, adjusted EPS has grown at a CAGR of 13.3%. We are proud of our track record on our journey to being among the elite growth companies of the world. MMC has consistently delivered strong financial performance over many years. We have come a long way since we began this journey nine years ago. Over that period, our adjusted operating income has nearly tripled to $2.7 billion and our adjusted margin increased from 8.8% to 20.5%. This performance has compared favorably to the broader market. Over the past nine years, MMC’s annual EPS growth has exceeded the S&P 500 by an average of 7 points. While we may not accomplish this every year, we do expect to grow EPS at a higher rate than the S&P 500 over long stretches of time with lower capital requirements and lower levels of risk. Let’s spend a few minutes on how we are positioning the firm for continued future growth. We invest to grow MMC both organically and through acquisitions. We have been improving the mix of business over several years by focusing our investment in growth areas while divesting or deemphasizing other parts of the business. Acquisitions are an important part of our balanced capital allocation strategy. Since 2009, we have committed nearly $6 billion across roughly 130 transactions. We invest to enhance the growth rate of the overall firm across three target areas, geography, segments and capabilities. Recent examples include our expansion throughout Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and South Africa; Marsh’s buildout of MMA and our UK SME strategy; the emergence at Marsh and Guy Carpenter of the cyber, flood and mortgage practices; investments at Mercer such as Workday implementation capabilities, global health and benefits technology and the Mercer Marketplace Health Exchange; and investments in Oliver Wyman and their digital technology and analytics platform; as well as continued pursuit of high-growth areas, including healthcare and public sector. These focused growth areas now account for over 25% of our total revenues, up from just 10% in 2010. We expect these faster-growing businesses will become a larger proportion of MMC over time, enhancing our long-term revenue growth. We are building the Company for the long term. We allocate capital based upon maximizing returns and increasing the future earnings power of MMC. This takes discipline and consistency as share repurchase will almost always be more accretive in the short term. We will always choose long-term value creation, which is in the best interest of our clients, colleagues and shareholders. We manage the firm to deliver not just in a given year, but to invest and build for the future. We believe MMC is positioned to deliver strong growth as the benefits of these investments emerge over time. Looking at 2017, we see the operating environment as broadly similar to last year, including modest global economic growth, political instability and foreign currency fluctuations. We see geopolitical risk, specifically its impact on foreign exchange rates, being a potential downside, but difficult to predict. That said, I have more hope than I had six months ago with regard to the U.S. around GDP growth, inflation, interest rates and possible U.S. corporate tax reform. Consolidated underlying revenue has grown in the range of 3% to 5% for the last seven years and we view this as the likely outcome for 2017. In addition, we expect to expand margins, deliver strong growth in adjusted EPS and return meaningful capital to shareholders. Before closing, I want to thank our 60,000 colleagues for their contributions. Our talented colleagues and how they serve clients are core to our long-term success. Companies that do well over long stretches of time can become complacent. Our culture guards against this. It is striving and challenging. It acknowledges that change is good and there is always a better way. This ensures a constant search for innovation, creativity and efficiency. It is my privilege to work with a strong leadership team that is defined by its core values of integrity, respect, inclusion and transparency. Our diversity of thought and cohesiveness are key strengths. We take our commitments seriously and we have delivered year after year. In summary, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results as we continue to execute our long-term strategic and operational objectives for growth. With that, let me turn it over to Mark to give you more details on our fourth quarter performance.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, Dan and good morning. In the fourth quarter, MMC’s performance was strong with underlying revenue growth at all of our operating companies, margin expansion in both segments and double-digit growth in both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share. Consolidated revenue increased 1% or 3% on an underlying basis. Operating income increased 6% while adjusted operating income rose 16% to $676 million. GAAP EPS rose 18% to $0.84 with adjusted EPS increasing 25% to $0.89 and our adjusted operating margin increased 250 basis points to 20.1%. As we stated on last quarter’s call, you get a better sense of our underlying performance looking at margins and margin improvement on a year-to-date basis. As Dan mentioned, for the full year, MMC’s consolidated adjusted margin expanded 140 basis points. At Risk and Insurance Services, fourth quarter revenue rose 4% to $1.8 billion with underlying growth of 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 15% to $421 million and the margin expanded 240 basis points to 23.5%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter rose 4% to $1.6 billion. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 5% led by solid contributions from all major geographies. The U.S./Canada division underlying growth was 4%. The International division underlying growth was 5%. EMEA really 5%; Asia-Pacific was up 4%; and Latin America grew 7%, which came on top of 13% growth in the prior-year quarter. In the fourth quarter, Marsh completed its acquisition of Bluefin Insurance Group. Bluefin will be combined with Jelf, which we acquired at the end of 2015, to create a leading SME insurance broker in the UK with more than 2,500 employees serving over 250,000 clients in 80 locations. In addition, this week, MMA completed the acquisition of Jay Smith Lanier, one of the largest privately held insurance brokers in the United States. JSL has annual revenue of approximately $130 million with 600 employees in 21 offices across the Southeast. With this addition, MMA’s annualized revenue now exceeds $1 billion. Guy Carpenter’s revenue was $222 million, an increase of 3% on both a reported and underlying basis. Underlying growth came on top of 5% growth in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the Consulting segment, underlying revenue rose 2%. Consulting’s adjusted operating income increased 13% to $299 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 220 basis points to 18.9%. Mercer’s underlying revenue increased 1% to $1.1 billion. Investments grew 10% while talent increased 3%. Health decreased 1% and retirement was down 3%. In the quarter, Mercer completed the acquisition of Thomsons Online Benefits, a leading global benefit software business. By combining our consulting and broking expertise with Thomson’s technology platform, we further position ourselves for sustained leadership and benefits globally. Over the last few months, Julio and his team have undertaken a review of Mercer’s organization. Following this review, Mercer decided to implement a number of changes, including simplifying the organization and reducing layers, all of which is intended to improve speed of decision-making, agility and efficiency. Fourth quarter results reflect a restructuring charge of $33 million that we have excluded from our adjusted results. Mercer expects additional restructuring charges of approximately $10 million in the first half of 2017. Oliver Wyman returned to growth in the fourth quarter. Revenue was $486 million with underlying growth of 4%, a bit better than we had expected. Results were driven by strength across several practices, including a strong performance in the public sector. As we mentioned on last quarter’s call, in the first quarter, Oliver Wyman faces a difficult comparison to the 15% underlying revenue growth in last year’s Q1. We are well-positioned for continued progress in 2017. This year, we expect to generate underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion and strong growth in earnings per share. As we typically do at this time of year, let me update you on our global retirement plans. As discussed on our last earnings call, we closed our U.S. defined benefit plan effective December 31, 2016 and froze future benefit accruals. As a result, we were required to remeasure our U.S. pension liabilities in the fourth quarter. This remeasurement resulted in incremental pension expense of less than $0.01 per share in the quarter. Moving to 2017 retirement expense, many factors go into determining the year-end measurement of our global pension expense. Beyond changes in discount rates and asset return, GAAP pension expense takes into account projected salary increases, mortality rates, demographics, inflation and contribution. Based on our year-end valuations, we expect our global retirement expense to decrease by approximately $30 million in 2017. Moving to foreign exchange. As we anticipated on last quarter’s call, the effect of foreign exchange on adjusted EPS was a slight positive in the fourth quarter, resulting in a de minimis impact for the full year. Assuming exchange rates remain at their current levels, we expect the effect of foreign exchange on 2017 operating income will be a slight negative. Investment income was $2 million in the fourth quarter, a slight increase over the prior year. For the full year 2016, investment income was less than $1 million compared with $38 million in 2015. Following the liquidation of Trident III in 2015, we have a substantially smaller private equity portfolio. As a result, we expect to generate only modest investment income going forward. Our adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter was 25.5% compared with 29.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The lower rate in the quarter reflects several items, including geographic mix of earnings and the recognition of some discrete items. For the year 2016, our adjusted tax rate was 28% compared with 28.7% in 2015. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% for 2017. Before I talk about our balance sheet and capital deployment, I want to reiterate the key elements of our corporate finance strategy. We talk about balance in many aspects of our strategy and our approach to capital allocation and our balance sheet is no exception. Our current position strikes a balance between the efficiency of our capital structure and prudent flexibility to pursue opportunities or manage through disruption. Since 2013, we’ve added more than $2.5 billion of debt to our balance sheet and reduced our cash balances by around $1 billion. Notwithstanding these moves, our balance sheet leverage remains well-positioned relative to our peers and the broader market. When we plan for capital deployment, the amount we target is a combination of the free cash flow we generate and the debt capacity we create from our strong earnings growth. This allows us to maintain our leverage ratio at its current level while deploying substantial amounts of capital. In terms of capital return, we have two annual commitments to our shareholders. We will increase our dividend per share at a double-digit rate and we will repurchase enough shares to reduce our share count. We establish these commitments for a reason. Very few companies are able to consistently increase dividends and reduce shares outstanding over long periods of time and the ones that do tend to significantly outperform the market. Beyond these commitments, capital deployed will be balanced across reinvestment in the business through acquisitions and other investments and returning excess capital to shareholders. We have a preference for reinvestment, but also recognize that returning capital through share repurchase can produce substantial returns as well. Our corporate finance strategy is consistent with our overall strategy, striking a balance between delivering solid results today while positioning for the future. Corporate debt at year-end 2016 was $4.8 billion, including $50 million of commercial paper outstanding. In January, we added an additional $1 billion of debt as part of our planned financing for 2017. Considering the $250 million debt maturity in April, we expect the net increase to overall debt in 2017 to be about $750 million. We project interest expense will be approximately $225 million with Q1 slightly higher than the rest of the year due to the April debt maturity. Cash on our balance sheet at year-end was just over $1 billion, which was down from about $1.4 billion at the end of 2015. Cash in the U.S. stood at $184 million. Uses of cash in the fourth quarter totaled over $1.1 billion and included $175 million for share repurchase, $178 million for dividends, and $778 million for acquisitions. For the full year, our uses of cash totaled nearly $2.5 billion and included $800 million for share repurchase, $682 million for dividends and $1 billion for acquisitions. In 2016, we delivered on our capital return commitment. We reduced our share count by 8 million shares and increased our dividends per share by 10%. For 2017, we expect to deploy capital in line with the level in 2016 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. With that, I’m happy to turn it back to Dan.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Mark. Derek, we are ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Quentin McMillan with KBW.
Quentin McMillan: Good morning. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Mark, very much for the color. Just about the restructuring charge in the Mercer business of $33 million, can you just help us understand what you are investing in there? You said $10 million of potential outlay for the first half. What is that going to help organic growth in Mercer and what specific divisions may that be?
Dan Glaser: Okay, so, Julio, you want to take that.
Julio Portalatin: Yes, sure. Yes. Thanks, Quentin. Part of our approach at Mercer has always been to be very disciplined in the way we look at our businesses and constantly challenge ourselves on how best to serve our clients, their needs and further drive growth and improve profitability and we’ve been doing that quite consistently over the years that I have had the opportunity to lead this great organization. Most of the times when we do these reviews and take whatever actions, we where those in our operating results, whatever they might be. This time, we are taking a small charge, certainly small relative to our overall base of $4.4 billion in revenue. One of the things we’ve done is we have created a wealth business, which basically allows us to take the retirement and the investment business, put it together and allow it to offer a value proposition against all of the asset management client needs across the entire spectrum. This reflects really how our clients want to do business with us. They are making decisions on managing and providing retirement benefits to their employees in ways that cut across these two businesses and we’ve made that easier for them to do and easier to do business with us. We also thought more broadly throughout the Company to provide a simplified and faster decision-making outcome by delayering, increasing spans of control, empowering decision-making closer to the client with the intent, of course, to be simpler and more agile. All of these actions will help us drive simplicity, agility and empowerment and ultimately, yes, we want to drive more growth too. That’s what our intent is or else we wouldn’t be doing it, and as time goes on, I think we will be able to see some of that.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Julio. Anything else Quentin?
Quentin McMillan: Great. And then – yes, just a quick question. You guys did the Bluefin acquisition. Can you tell us how much cash you have left overseas and then a bigger picture question with that is if the new administration does have a repatriation and a benefit on the tax side for that, would you guys repatriate the majority of your overseas capital and would that change anything in terms of your outlook for maybe share repurchases or other opportunities within the U.S.?
Dan Glaser: Okay. So a couple of things and then I will hand over to Mark to give you a little bit more detail. Over a long stretch of time, we have developed ways to effectively bring back the cash that we need from our overseas operation without putting undue stress on our overall tax rate. But having said that, we absolutely believe, as a matter of U.S. competitiveness, that a territorial system, which matches up with the rest of the OECD, makes complete sense, not a tax holiday as a one-time kind of basis, but a permanent level of reform that unshackles U.S. corporations from having to even think about where cash is located where foreign competitors do not. But Mark, do you want to add to that.
Mark McGivney: Sure. Quentin, in terms of the cash offshore, so about $1 billion of cash I talked about, as I mentioned $184 million or so of that is in the U.S. and the balance would be overseas and just to build on what Dan said. We have proven very effective of getting access to our global cash flows every year and so that we don’t necessarily have trapped cash offshore, if you will, and what goes into the roundly $2.5 billion of capital we deployed this year is getting full access to our free cash flow around the world.
Quentin McMillan: Perfect. Thanks very much, guys.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Quentin. Next question please.
Operator: Next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan: Thank you and good morning. First question is on the brokerage organic growth, 5%, very strong in the quarter. Could you give a little bit more color on that, especially in EMEA? Do you see any sort of like lifting uncertainty post-Brexit that could help the growth going forward?
Dan Glaser: I mean one of the things, Kai and then I will hand off to Peter because you mentioned EMEA specifically. It’s interesting that EMEA has grown underlying revenue for 24 straight quarters. So it has been a stalwart within Marsh’s overall performance, which has been consistently solid across many years. Peter, do you want to give some more color?
Peter Zaffino: Thanks, Dan, and thanks, Kai. We are really pleased and proud, as you pointed out, on our fourth quarter results with 5% underlying growth. We had equal contributions from the U.S. and Canada and International. I think it’s important to take a look at the year though where we had 3% underlying growth, really strong contributions from many parts of the world. If there is one bright spot within the year that I would like to point out it would be our new business growth and so we are attracting new clients and that was particularly pronounced in the fourth quarter. We had a slower start to the year, but obviously a much stronger finish. The components of the growth, as I said, were terrific new business led by the U.S. core brokerage business. We had solid renewal growth because we had strong new business in the fourth quarter last year. So overall contributing to strong growth in the fourth quarter. If I was to comment on EMEA specifically, as you pointed out, again a very strong quarter, a lot of this was driven by renewal growth in Continental Europe had a very strong new business year in the fourth quarter 2015. Several additional bright spots within EMEA were Middle East had a terrific quarter, its best quarter of the year. And Africa had strong organic growth. In addition, we had very good new business in the UK. So overall all components of EMEA contributing.
Dan Glaser: Thanks. Kai, any other questions?
Kai Pan: Yes, a follow-up on the M&A, now $1 billion total revenue. I just wonder are you sort of better integrating that business with the rest of Marsh or you leave it around to just preserve that entrepreneurship. I just wonder any synergy between these two like intraorganization.
Dan Glaser: There is some mild revenue synergy; very little expense synergy because we are not going to pick up nickels in front of a steamroller. The very idea of us creating that division is to maintain its entrepreneurial spirit, its separate approach and it’s a different kind of business and so we have no intention of integrating MMA into Marsh.
Kai Pan: Great. Thank you so much.
Dan Glaser: Next question.
Operator: Next we’ll hear from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse.
Ryan Tunis: Hey thanks, good morning. I guess just thinking about the end of the year and Mercer, I guess 1% organic growth. Maybe you guys could just give a little bit more detail about the fourth quarter there I guess in particular and health benefits where it looked like organic declined?
Dan Glaser: Absolutely. I think Julio is very happy to be in the first quarter of 2017 because we’ve been talking about the fourth quarter for about the last month. [Indiscernible] Julio?
Julio Portalatin: Okay, thanks. Thanks. Thanks, Ryan. Let me give a little bit of a panoramic view. Mercer across all [indiscernible] globally, okay, so let’s just start there and then I’ll get back to health, has been operating in a 3% to 4% world for quite some time and over the course of the year, of course, quarters will vacillate and they will fluctuate. Our 2016 global Mercer results continue in that same range with underlying revenue growth of 3% and strong earnings growth, of course and further margin expansion. And that’s probably where I would think of Mercer in 2017 as well. So health, it did have a pullback in the fourth quarter, but, as I mentioned, we don’t really want to focus too much on one quarter, but rather look at the year’s performance, which in the case of health again was around 3%. We did have, in the fourth quarter, some client retention that held up rather well quite frankly and we were pleased to see that. We like to see our clients sticking around for us to continue to sell additional project work to, but we did have some softness in that project work in the fourth quarter. And I’m sure it won’t be surprising to hear that some of our prospects and clients are indeed taking a bit longer to make decisions as they wait for the impact of the potential changes that are going to be coming about, especially in the areas of the ACA and others. So it wouldn’t be surprising that some softness would be picked up. But health remains a very profitable and growing business for Mercer. We expect this business will continue to be a strong contributor for Mercer. So thank you.
Dan Glaser: And also Ryan that to give the 1% too much of a pass, but it was a pretty tough comparator because Mercer grew 5% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Any other questions?
Ryan Tunis: Yes. Just I appreciate that you guys don’t target margins. It’s a product I guess of organic revenues, organic expenses, but one thing that I guess stood out to me this quarter in RIS was, if I just look at the expense base and kind of adjust for acquisitions and currency, it looked like organic expense growth was pretty close to flat on the quarter. I was just wondering if there is something going on in terms of an organic expense management story there, if there is something you are doing differently where you think, I don’t know, structurally or cyclically at this point you think that you can – you don’t necessarily need to grow organic expenses at kind of the 2% to 3% level you’ve talked about historically. Thanks.
Dan Glaser: Let me talk about margins a little bit broadly and then I will hand over to Peter to get into RIS a little bit on the margin front. The first thing you have to do is look at the full year and rolling four quarters as well. The longer stretches the better. You are very right that we don’t have a margin target, but having said that, we have improved margins for nine consecutive years and actually we are about 1,200 basis points higher from where we started this journey, so margin growth has been a big part of our overall performance. When you asked whether we are doing anything differently in terms of managing our organic expense growth, the answer is yes. And it has been yes every year for nine years. We are continually finding ways of creating more value in our business. We believe we are in a more for less business with clients. We have to deliver more value to them at lower internal cost year after year. And so our search for efficiency, our culture of there’s always a smarter way of doing something is rooted deeply within the organization. And so when we look at the overall company for the quarter, we only grew expense 1% and for the year, we grew expense 2%, but pretty consistently over nine years, we have grown revenue at a faster pace than growing expense. Peter, do you want to talk about RIS?
Peter Zaffino: Sure, Dan. I’ll just add a few comments on RIS. The adjusted NOI margin for the quarter was 240 basis points, but I think it’s really important just to look at the full-year margin as the quarters can have considerable seasonality and so that was 140 basis points and it was helped by pension, but I think what Dan said in the earlier comments and he said many quarters is that the margin really does reflect the way that we run the business. Historically, we’ve made a lot of investments. We grow revenue greater than expense and during that period, we’ve had a number of investments that have increased efficiencies. We are adding headcount. As of January, we will have over 900 producers in MMA, so that’s a great example. We’ve added headcount in Continental Europe, in Latin America, in Asia where we think there’s real good opportunities to grow and on top of that, we’ve been wearing intangible amortization, which has doubled since 2011 in our margin. So we have been very disciplined.
Dan Glaser: One thing to bear in mind as well in terms of overall margins when you look at the Company, we’ve been pretty consistent in both segments and so each segment year after year has delivered margin growth. And as Peter mentioned, for the year, pension was a help; FX was a help as well, but even subtracting out those two factors, we had strong margin expansion in both segments.
Ryan Tunis: Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Next question please.
Operator: Next we have Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi thanks. Good morning. My first question is on Guy Carpenter. As we think about 2017, you guys have made a decent number of hires in that segment over the past year. How do you think about just the growth outlook for that business and the margin profile there? And when we think about growth picking up potentially for some of the hires from Guy Carpenter, is that something that we would see in 2017 or does it sometimes take longer for potentially thinking of you guys taking on business from some of your competitors in the space?
Dan Glaser: Okay. So I will hand off to Peter in a second to talk specifically about Guy Carpenter, but I would just say really broadly that we are a big company, so hiring people very rarely will move a needle for a $13 billion revenue company and every year, we attract a lot of talent into the organization. I think more than any other factor over the last nine years that has re-emerged within Marsh & McLennan Companies is that we are the employer of choice in our chosen industries and that we attract a tremendous amount of talent who want to come work in Marsh & McLennan. So that level of strategic recruitment is very strong throughout the firm and the quality that we are adding within the firm is quite considerable. When you think about the new hiring we do in terms of strategic recruitment, combined with the attrition that we would normally have in any given year, you are talking about hiring something like 7000 people a year and so we take it really seriously. We run people through a labyrinth because ultimately we know we become who we hire. So we take that really seriously and we are really excited about not only Guy Carpenter, but the rest of the organization, the talent that we are able to attract into the firm. Peter, do you want to address GC specifically?
Peter Zaffino: Sure, Dan. Thanks. Elyse, let me just comment on the fourth quarter and the year for Guy Carpenter briefly. We had 3% underlying growth in the fourth quarter, their seasonally smallest quarter, but that was on top of 5% growth in the fourth quarter of 2015. So it was a tough comp for them, but they did very well. Very strong new business in the U.S., Asia and the global specialties. We continue to see rate decreases if we look at the fourth quarter led by property, but overall doing 2% for the year with Guy Carpenter, we were very pleased. We are making strategic investments. It’s around people, data analytics and organizational design 2016 I think we accomplished a lot. Appointed new leaders. We continue to add and develop key talent. One thing to note though, the headcount is not up. I mean we are creating our own space to invest by being more efficient. So overall we’ve made some terrific hires that complement Guy Carpenter. We do believe it will help with production and top-line growth, but we are managing the headcount and expense and we have a lot of momentum and expect us to continue on the path that we have delivered over the past several years.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you. And then if I tie together some of your comments on the 2017 outlook, it seems like the lower retirement expense is to some degree offset by the higher interest expense from the debt you guys issued. So when we think about potential EPS growth, you were about 12% in 2016. Your commentary on an organic basis would lead me to think 2017 might be a little bit better than 2016, just very high level. So how do you think EPS growth? Do you get closer to your 13% target in 2017 just based on where we sit today and how you are thinking about the economy and things like that kind of post the U.S. election?
Dan Glaser: Okay, so a few things. One, we are happy to inhabit this world that is filled with risk and uncertainty and the visibility is not clear. So while we feel pretty good about where we are sitting today in terms of the internal operations of Marsh & McLennan, we are still quite concerned about when we look at the rest of the world and we are impacted by macro factors and whether it’s global GDP growth, for us specifically U.S. and UK GDP growth, P&C rates and premium growth, exposures, that sort of thing, 10-year yields, foreign exchanges. There’s a whole plethora of things for us to stay up at night thinking about on a macro basis right. So you go back nine years ago, our issues were inside the shop; now it’s really, well, what’s going on in the rest of the world and there’s enough things that keep us kind of on our toes. Now having said that, it’s certainly been a challenging environment all the way since the 2008 financial crisis and we have been able to generate 3% to 5% organic growth even in a difficult global economic environment with other macro factors, which are generally more headwinds than tailwinds. And so if we were making any predictions, and it’s not guidance, it’s kind of soft, we are kind of well, we’ve been in 3% to 5% for a lot of years now, so we are probably still in 3% to 5%. The world doesn’t seem like it has changed all that much and so that’s I think where we are. Now what does that mean for EPS? If you go back – first of all, our adjusted EPS CAGR since 2009 has been 13%, so we are proud of that delivery. It’s very strong performance, market-leading and we’ve delivered for shareholders. Now when we established that goal in 2010, our margins were much lower than they are today and clearly, it’s just the math. It becomes more difficult to grow at that pace the higher your margins become and in fact, it can be counterproductive because you need more separation, more air between revenue growth and expense growth to drive the same amount of margin expansion. So while margin expansion was a key strategy of ours when you go back to where we were behind the pack in 2009, in 2010, in 2011, we are much more focused now on top-line growth and investing in the business for long- term performance than we are for any short-term margin expansion. Having said that, we do expect margin expansion in both segments in 2017. We don’t give guidance on EPS growth. I mean our 13% CAGR I remind you is over a long period of time. It’s not any one year. It’s not an annual target. We don’t operate that way. We don’t budget ourselves that way, but we expect 2017 to be a pretty decent year, but it’s really too early to call where we will end up with that, but we are reasonably optimistic. We are certainly no more pessimistic than we were at this time last year.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you very much.
Dan Glaser: Our next question please.
Operator: Next question comes from Dave Styblo with Jefferies.
Dave Styblo: Thanks for the questions. I wanted to come back to taxes, more importantly, just to get a better understanding of how you guys might have considered Trump or Ryan’s tax reform plans impacting you. I suppose there’s so many moving parts here, but there is the direct penal impact from your corporate taxes benefitting and then maybe there’s an offset from potentially repealing the deductibility of net interest expense and then maybe not immediately impacting you, but further down the line would be higher GDP growth from corporations outside of you investing and just needing more P&C and insurance overall. So have you guys sort of triangulated those data points to kind of get a better sense of maybe more near term how things could impact you versus longer-term?
Dan Glaser: The answer is yes, we spend a lot of time thinking about those different scenarios and we can drive ourselves crazy because nobody has any idea and it’s only speculation as to what would actually happen. So let me really take it at a helicopter view as opposed to any of the specifics. I mean certainly corporate tax reform in the U.S. would improve U.S. competitiveness, spur investment and create jobs. And so we are absolutely encouraged that it is a priority of the new administration and several members of Congress to address our convoluted corporate tax system in the United States. Having said that, we are not certain in any way, shape or form that there will be corporate tax reform in the U.S. so it remains a hope and not something for us to really strategize around. I mean it’s fair to say that any corporate tax reform in the U.S. would be good for Marsh & McLennan Companies. How good would depend on the details of it. And just as an aside, we would say the bulk of any tax savings that we could receive will drop into earnings and improve free cash flow. But that’s really all we have to say just the devil is in the details and it’s only a potential benefit to us. I would just reaffirm that we’ve executed regardless of our tax rate and it doesn’t drive our strategy.
Dave Styblo: Sure, sure. Okay. And then, obviously, saw the headline on the national flood insurance program that has been finalized now. Can you talk a little bit more about the timing, the economics there? And then specifically it seems like the technical strengths that you showcased resonated. I’m wondering if there is something there that could help signal what you are bringing to the table is superior and perhaps help with other RFP shots on goal.
Dan Glaser: Yes. Absolutely and I will hand over to Peter, but obviously we are thrilled with the win, particularly because when we evaluated the companies that would have enabled us to become a major player in the write your own flood market, we believe that Torrent had the best technology and was the best shop for the future and so it’s nice to have that validated by at least one large entity. But Peter?
Peter Zaffino: Thanks, Dan. Let me describe a little bit about what Torrent is and then talk a little bit about the national flood program. Torrent is a best-in-class flood servicing company. It has terrific technology. We acquired Torrent in 2014 because, as Dan just outlined, we believe the company had built market-leading technology and would position Marsh to be a leader and innovator in the evolving flood insurance market. So that’s the NFIP as well as the private market. We’ve made good progress to date. Technology, again, that is industry-leading and the team has met expectations, so we are very excited about the future. We are very pleased that FEMA formally appointed Torrent in January of 2017 as the direct servicing agent for the National Flood Insurance Program. Being selected as a contractor, we’ll administer approximately 20% to 25% of the NFIP policies. So what you have seen publicly in terms of the estimated contract is based on the number of policies. So it could go up or down depending on the number of policies that go in and the guidance has been around $20 million to $25 million annually, so it’s a four-year appointment with an opportunity to extend for an additional year. Some of the things that I think that they found attractive was our ability to help facilitate NFIP’s response to flood events, improving the customer experience for the policyholders, maintaining data security and delivering continuous innovation. Those are just some of the highlights and we really look forward to working with the federal government to improve its performance and we are excited to get going.
Dave Styblo: Thanks, Peter.
Dan Glaser: Next question please.
Operator: Next question comes from Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.
Charles Sebaski: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Dan Glaser: Good morning.
Charles Sebaski: Just have a general question on the business overall on how – you talked, I guess, Dan, more on the more for less as a business philosophy of what you guys are having to deliver. I’m just curious if there’s anything changing with regard to the relationship between organic growth and the ability to drive efficiencies in the business? I’m wondering if be it technology, be it other components of what’s driving operating leverage and if the long-term relationship between ability to gain efficiencies is the same or equally dependent on organic growth as it has been in the past.
Dan Glaser: Yes. Well, we absolutely believe that there’s linkage between revenue and expense and that is – in a consulting firm and a brokerage firm like we have, the one thing that we can control is expense whereas revenue is really how are you positioned. Are you investing on the expense side in the right things to remain strategically relevant to your client base? So we spend a lot of time thinking about the customer experience and what clients will need, what is a day in the life of a client three years from now and trying to position ourselves to be able to provide value to that client out into the future. And obviously, that means a little bit more on analytics, a little bit more on data analysis, a little bit more, but not necessarily losing that high touch relationship manager, face to face because we still think that remains very relevant in the businesses that we operate. The world is changing fast and I think that there are a lot more efficiencies to come. Even though we are experimenting, we have very little use of robotics or artificial intelligence or deep learning within our businesses today in any material way and so who knows where that can lead us. Ultimately, the package of what we deliver and what we focus on is more about what do we think clients not only need today, but what will they need in the future, are we positioned to deal with that, what are our gaps and that’s where our investments are. But this is a brains business, a people business and the most fundamental factor is do we have a group of smart, hard-working, dedicated, client-centered people working in a collaborative, cohesive environment and so the cultural aspect we view as a competitive advantage that is going to endure for a long period of time and there is not too many companies in the world like Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Charles Sebaski: Appreciate that. I guess just maybe a numbers or an understanding. On some of the recent acquisitions, Bluefin, Jay Smith, just coming into 2017, given the size, is there any seasonality to those businesses and how they are going to earn through next year that we should just keep aware of?
Dan Glaser: Peter, do you want to address that?
Peter Zaffino: There is no seasonality that I would draw your attention to. If you look MMA as a business, it is very consistent quarter-to-quarter, roughly 25% of their revenue in each of the quarters and so I wouldn’t guide you towards any one particular quarter that we would be lower or higher.
Charles Sebaski: Thank you very much for the answers.
Dan Glaser: Next question please.
Operator: Next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Josh Shanker: Thank you very much everyone. I realize there’s – people have questions about tax. We don’t know anything. In the age of not knowing anything yet, does that change how much you are willing to pay or how much the way you are going to finance a large deal if you were to do one?
Dan Glaser: Yes. I will take that a little bit and then I will hand over to Mark to address that a little bit more detail. I mean first of all, we’ve had a string-of-pearls strategy more than anything else. We have not done what I would consider to be large acquisitions for quite some time within the firm. We’ve done an aggregation of the many, I mean something like 130 acquisitions over the last six or seven years and so, obviously, the integration risks when we do integrate are far smaller. Due diligence is far crisper and clearer and that has been our focus. I mean who knows what the future would hold on that, but largely because the acquisitions are not very large in nature, we’ve been not using much financing. It’s been mainly using cash. But Mark, do you want to take that?
Mark McGivney: Yes, just a comment on value. We will see where things come out, but obviously U.S. firms, they have more cash flow and so it could increase value of things, and of course, they are more valuable because of the higher cash flows coming out. In terms of impact on how we finance or our capital structure, at this point, I don’t think so. We will see what the change could be, but I don’t see it having a – fundamentally changing our view on our overall capital structure.
Dan Glaser: The other thing I would just add to it is we’ve talked about MMA before many times because MMA, one, we are very satisfied with the agency and we have committed over $2.5 billion of capital since 2009, so it’s been our biggest capital deployment in any one segment. And the returns have been good and of course, our returns on the investments that we have already made assume the high U.S. level of tax rate and we are satisfied with those returns. So if ultimately the U.S. tax rate comes down, it means the money that we’ve already committed, that $2.5 billion return profile, is far better than the good returns that we are already receiving and so it is a huge potential positive for us.
Josh Shanker: And I would assume any benefit from a lower tax rate that comes into EPS, would that money get reinvested in the business, or would you have a plan to return that directly to shareholders?
Dan Glaser: At the end, we’ve been returning more capital to shareholders than our free cash flow and we expect to do that in 2017 as well. Our view on whether there’s lower taxes in the U.S., and now largely the bulk of that would fall into earnings and fall into free cash flow and then we would use our regular balanced capital allocation strategy to return that money to shareholders through not only organic investments, but as well as dividend policy, acquisitions and share repurchase.
Josh Shanker: Okay. Status quo. Thank you very much. Take care.
Dan Glaser: Sure. Next question please.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time.
Dan Glaser: Okay, fantastic. Well, I would just like to thank everybody for joining us this morning and specifically thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. Have a good day.
Operator: Once again that does conclude today’s conference. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Third quarter 2016 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is our CFO, Mark McGivney; Peter Zaffino, the Chairman of Risk and Insurance Services; Julio Portalatin, CEO of Mercer; Scott McDonald, CEO of Oliver Wyman; and Keith Walsh, Head of Investor Relations. I'll begin with a discussion of our third quarter and nine-month results, and then address our outlook for growth. MMC produced another strong quarter, delivering double-digit growth in adjusted EPS with margin expansion in both Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting. Underlying revenue growth was 1%, driven by a decline at Oliver Wyman. Operating income rose 24% or 16% on an adjusted basis. We have positioned the firm to deliver strong EPS growth in a variety of market environment as we actively manage expenses while investing for the future. Our ability to consistently grow earnings is a testament to our culture of execution and accountability throughout the firm. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter underlying revenue rose 2%. Adjusted operating income increased double-digits with the adjusted margin expanding to 18.5%. In Consulting, underlying revenue growth of 3% at Mercer was offset by a 9% decline at Oliver Wyman. Earnings growth was strong, with adjusted operating income rising 8%, bringing the adjusted margin to 20.4%, the highest level in over 30 years. Through nine months, we produced consolidated underlying revenue growth of 3%. The adjusted operating margin of the company in both operating segments expanded 100 basis points. Growth in earnings per share was 12%, with 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share. We are pleased with our year-to-date performance, and are on track for a strong 2016. Over the last couple of years, we have seen volatility around commodity prices and foreign exchange, declining interest rates, weak global GDP growth, political instability and lower P&C insurance pricing. Despite this backdrop, we have produced significantly higher earnings growth than the S&P 500. In the current macro environment, where there may be a tendency to hunker down or become short-term focused, we remain focused on the mid- to long-term. I remain positive about our prospects and want to share with you what we are doing to position MMC for continued growth. We aspire to be recognized among the elite global growth companies. Our goal is to continue to produce higher returns at lower risk than the overall market. We continue to position the company for long-term revenue growth. Our optimism is driven by three factors: we are in growth businesses; we have consistently invested for growth; and we are harnessing the talent and power of Marsh & McLennan Companies. First, we are well positioned in growth businesses. We are a trusted advisor, helping our clients not only address the critical issues of the day, but prepare for the issues of the future relating to risk, strategy and people. Our existing businesses are part of an expanding global pie that should drive greater demand for our advice and services over time. The strategic positioning of MMC has never been stronger. We firmly believe our businesses will continue to expand. The world is becoming more complex and our clients are grappling with a number of issues relating to risk, strategy and people. In many markets, there is limited penetration of insurance broking and consulting that will grow over time. And in many parts of the world, governments have taken on too much risk that could be more efficiently placed in the private market and this carries beyond P&C insurance to include healthcare and retirement savings. We have the people, expertise and infrastructure to capitalize on these global trends across all of our operating companies. We have also made significant investments for growth over many years, both organic and through acquisitions. Since 2009 we have invested over $7 billion for growth and efficiency. This includes over 120 acquisitions approaching $5 billion, capital expenditures of $2.4 billion and the addition of over 10,000 colleagues. Our investments fall into three broad categories: geographic expansion, segmentation, and new capabilities and innovations. We expect these faster growing businesses will become a larger proportion of the overall company over time, enhancing our long-term revenue growth. Starting with geographic expansion, we have made substantial investments throughout Latin America and Africa, as well as increased our presence in Asia and other emerging economies. These regions have been under-served by professional services and have higher long-term growth prospects relative to the developed world. Another area of growth is developing new segments and specializations within existing businesses. At Marsh, we have had success with the mid-market strategy in the U.S. with our MMA platform, and more recently in the UK with the acquisition of Jelf. Mercer has created growth segments in key areas including investment management and its global health and benefits platforms. Guy Carpenter has grown specialist practices in areas such as mutuals, agriculture, medical and strategic advisory. And Oliver Wyman continues to invest in industry verticals where we see potential, such as the public sector, healthcare and financial services. Many of our investments include new capabilities and innovations. Our data and analytics platforms continue to differentiate in the market across all of our operating companies. Consulting has generated strong growth from OW Labs with its market leading use of predictive analytics. Mercer has expanded its capabilities to include its Workday Implementation business, the Pension Risk Exchange for pension buyouts, and is developing an array of digital and mobile solutions to serve clients. Turning to RIS, flood, cyber and digital distribution are just a few of the areas that could represent faster growth for this segment. Lastly, I want to touch on harnessing the power of MMC. We are a unique firm built around risk, strategy and people. There is no single company we compete against that matches the collective capabilities of our four operating companies. We view this as an enduring competitive advantage. We have made great strides in connecting the strengths of our operating companies and how we manage MMC, generate cost efficiencies, and how we deliver value to clients. Over the last several years, we have taken a significant number of structural steps to bring together the collective strength of MMC for clients. Some examples include: forming Mercer Marsh Benefits, which brings the best of Mercer and Marsh together in driving global benefit solutions outside the United States; bringing leadership of the RIS segment under Peter Zaffino; a more unified Oliver Wyman, which enhances the intellectual capital of MMC; promoting colleague mobility, in fact in the past three years approximately 3,000 colleagues have moved within the company; the formation of our Strategic Solutions Group to deliver the full capabilities of MMC; and the establishment of Chief Country Officers that help drive in-country collaboration. Taken together, these actions better position us for sustainable growth and profitability. No matter what the environment, we are always thinking about the mid and long term, and I believe MMC is better positioned today than at any time in its history. In summary, we produced strong earnings growth in the third quarter and are on track to deliver another year of excellent financial performance in 2016. For the full year, we continue to expect underlying revenue growth, meaningful margin expansion in both segments, and strong EPS growth, all this while continuing to invest in our future and return capital to shareholders through dividends and substantial share repurchase. With that, let me turn it over to Mark to review our third quarter results in more detail.
Mark Christopher McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Dan, and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, MMC delivered strong earnings, producing double-digit growth in both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share. Consolidated revenue increased 1% on both a reported and underlying basis. Operating income increased 24%, while adjusted operating income rose 16%. GAAP EPS rose 20% to $0.73 with adjusted EPS increasing 10% to $0.69. And our adjusted margin rose 240 basis points to 18%. As we stated on last quarter's call, you get a better sense of our underlying performance looking at margins and margin improvement on a year-to-date basis. Through nine months, adjusted margins expanded 100 basis points overall and in each operating segment. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue rose 3% to $1.6 billion with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income increased 22% to $302 million, and the margin expanded 280 basis points to 18.5%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.4 billion, an increase of 4%. This solid growth reflects recent acquisitions, such as Jelf in the UK and ongoing activity in Marsh & McLennan Agency. On an underlying basis, revenue rose 2%. In the U.S./Canada division, underlying growth was 3%, driven primarily by strong new business in the U.S. In the International division, underlying growth was 2%. EMEA was flat, with growth in the UK offset by Europe and the Middle East. Asia Pacific was up 2%, and Latin America had strong growth of 9%, which came on top of 6% growth in last year's third quarter. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $260 million, flat on both a reported and underlying basis. EMEA and Global Specialties, led by Marine, had positive trends in the quarter. Year-to-date underlying revenue growth was 2%. In the Consulting segment, underlying revenue was flat, reflecting growth at Mercer offset by a decline at Oliver Wyman. As we've discussed on prior calls, we've built a model where Oliver Wyman's compensation is performance sensitive, so their expense base, which is largely compensation and benefits, naturally flexes with their revenue. Whether up or down, Oliver Wyman has much more of a revenue impact on MMC than an earnings impact. Consulting's adjusted operating income increased 8% to $309 million, which represents the highest level of profitability for any quarter in Consulting's history. The adjusted operating margin expanded 190 basis points to 20.4%. Mercer's underlying revenue increased 3% to $1.1 billion. Solid performance in the quarter continues to reflect the benefits of a diversified portfolio. Investments and talent both rose 7%, health increased 2%, and retirement was flat. On a geographic basis, revenue increased in all major regions for both the third quarter and nine months. In our Mercer Marketplace 365 Benefits platform, we're providing access for approximately 1.5 million lives, flat with last year. We have consistently talked about how Mercer Marketplace is not a material contributor to our overall results, and we don't expect it will be in the near term. However, we remain positive regarding the long-term growth potential of our health and benefits business. As we anticipated on last quarter's call, Oliver Wyman had a decline in underlying revenue in the third quarter. This was driven by comparisons to very strong growth in the financial service practice last year, as well as global growth concerns exacerbated by Brexit uncertainty. Oliver Wyman's revenue was $404 million, a decline of 9%, on an underlying basis. In the fourth quarter, we expect Oliver Wyman's revenue growth to be relatively flat with last year. As we look ahead to the first quarter of next year, recall that Oliver Wyman generated 15% growth in the first quarter of this year. Overall, we continue to expect that for 2016, MMC will generate underlying revenue growth, increased operating margins in both segments and strong growth in earnings per share. Next, I'd like to update you on changes we will be making to our U.S. Retirement Plan. We recently decided to close our U.S. defined benefit plans effective December 31, 2016 and freeze future benefit accruals. In their place, we will implement an enhanced defined contribution plan effective January 2017. These actions are consistent with our global benefits philosophy of providing competitive benefits and a preference for DC over DB. This represents the latest of several actions we've taken around retirement benefits in the last three years. With the closing of the U.S. DB plan, we will have capped the growth of benefit accruals with a vast majority of our global pension liabilities, which reduces risk and volatility. The timing and nature of this announcement requires that we revisit the assumptions used at year-end 2015 and re-measure our U.S. pension liabilities in the fourth quarter. Based on current assumption, including lower interest rates, we expect to incur incremental pension expense of a $0.01 or so in the fourth quarter. This additional expense will be included in our adjusted EPS. Last quarter I mentioned that although the declining global interest rates could mean higher pension expense in 2017, we were planning for this risk and expected we would be able to effectively mitigate any increase. Based on the environment today, we continue to believe we will be able to mitigate any pension expense volatility in 2017. Moving to foreign exchange, in the third quarter, the effect of foreign exchange on adjusted EPS was a slight positive. Assuming exchange rates remain at their current level, we expect FX to be immaterial in the fourth quarter, result in a de minimis impact for the full year. We have seen continued volatility in the British pound, but as we discussed last quarter, a weakening pound generally has a minimal overall impact to MMC over the course of the year. It's because RIS has a natural hedge created by U.S. dollar placements in London. While the impact of the weakening pound to MMC in total is not significant, there is a benefit to RIS, offset by an adverse impact to Consulting. Investment income was negligible in the third quarter, and was down $34 million, or about $0.04 per share from last year. For the full year 2016, we expect investment income to be immaterial compared with $38 million in 2015. As you may remember, we have a substantially smaller private equity portfolio following the liquidation of Trident III in 2015. As a result, we expect to generate only modest investment income going forward. Our adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 28.7% compared with 28.4% in last year's third quarter. Through the first nine months of 2016, our adjusted tax rate was 28.8% compared with 28.5% for the same period last year. Based on the current landscape, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% for the remainder of 2016. Corporate debt at September 30 was $4.8 billion, unchanged from the end of June. Our next debt maturity is $250 million of notes due next April. In the third quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares of our stock for $200 million. Through nine months, we used $625 million to buy back 10 million shares. Third quarter marks the 18th consecutive quarter we have bought back our stock, and we have reduced shares outstanding 10 quarters in a row. Since announcing our commitment to reduce our annual share count at Investor Day in March 2014, shares outstanding have declined by 33 million or 6%. Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $1.4 billion, of which approximately $400 million was in the U.S. Uses of cash in the third quarter totaled $440 million and included $200 million for share repurchases, $178 million for dividends, and $62 million for acquisitions. For the nine months, uses of cash totaled $1.4 billion and included $625 million for share repurchases, $504 million for acquisitions, and $229 million – I'm sorry, $504 million for dividends and $229 million for acquisitions. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital through dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. We also expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividends per share by double-digits. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Mark. Operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question is from Quentin McMillan with KBW. Please go ahead.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thanks very much. I just wanted to dig into the underlying margin expansion. Obviously a very strong number that you guys had put up, but with what was a slightly weaker organic quarter, I think that the question that's on top of people's mind is how are you able to sort of achieve that level of margin expansion at a 1% organic? And is that sustainable going forward? Thanks.
Mark Christopher McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Quentin. You know as we said before, margin expansion is an outcome of our running the business properly. We grow revenues faster than expenses virtually all the time, and when that's not the case it's purposeful and it's planned for. We've said before that you shouldn't really look at margin expansion in an individual quarter. It's more important and more meaningful to look at it over a longer stretch of time: year-to-date basis or rolling four quarters, something like that. If you look on a year-to-date basis, the company overall is up 100 basis points against 3% overall growth for the company. And each of the segments is also up 100 basis points, and I think that's more indicative of where our margin expansion really is. So, I wouldn't take the dramatic expansion in the third quarter as the new reality going forward.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great, thanks. And then just switching to Marsh, and this may be for Dan or Peter, but you guys had recently made a management change in the North America segment as Martin South is named the Head of U.S. and Canada and it seems like you guys had a nice quarter there bouncing back from flat organic to a plus 3% in this quarter. Can you talk about just any impact of the leadership change or any other strategic shifts in North America and Canada that might have benefited that organic, and what we might expect to benefit going forward?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure, sure. Peter, you want to take that?
Peter Zaffino - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. Quentin, first let me start with core fundamentals of what happened in the U.S. and Canada in the third quarter. We're very pleased with the growth of 3%. The U.S. had a very strong new business quarter as well as contribution from strong client and revenue retention. MMA continues to be a strong contributor, the core U.S. was a strong contributor and Canada was less of a headwind. In terms of leadership, I'll start with John Doyle. John has had a material impact since he has arrived at Marsh. There is no executive that I'm aware of that knows more of our clients and has been heavily engaged in working with clients, working with our colleagues, and focusing on top line growth. Martin South has been with Marsh for many years and is a very established leader. His most positive attributes are how he grows businesses and his innovation and he has had a positive impact on the U.S. and Canada division as well. It's early days for him, but expect a combination of John's arrival and Martin's arrival in the United States is going to have a really positive impact for our ability to grow the business in the future.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: And I think it's important for you to recognize that our leadership moves are done out of strength. Most of them are internal, but we also look externally to always build our capabilities. And if you just look at RIS in the last year alone, adding people like John Doyle, Peter Hearn, Chris Schaper, I mean it's pretty incredible injection of talent on a leadership basis into the business. And so it's a great mixture of homegrown and then looking into the marketplace and getting the best available athlete at any point in time. Next question please.
Operator: We'll go next to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks so much. Just a couple of quick ones here. Just thinking about margins in the fourth quarter and relative to last year and third quarter here relative to last year, typically when we look sequentially you get a big lift in the fourth quarter. So I'm just trying to understand, like, given the big lift that we saw here in the third quarter, how should we be thinking about – sequential obviously that's not the way the business runs – but just trying to get an idea just given, especially in RIS, the big lift in third quarter margins that we saw?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah, no. So hi, Mike. I would say, again, look at the year-to-date and look at the rolling 12 months or rolling four quarters as more indicative of what our expectation of margin expansion is. You mentioned RIS. If you look at RIS over the last five years, they've increased about 660 basis points in terms of, yeah, about 600 basis points actually over that period of time. So they've had around a 500, 510, 520 bps margin expansion on a CAGR basis over that period of time. So I think that's the way you should look at that.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you for that. And then, Mark, you've sort of mentioned Oliver Wyman and the way that that business is structured and that the revenue impact tends to be outside relative to the margin impact. Just trying to think about how the breakup of revenues in the quarter, assuming that Mercer margins are higher than Oliver Wyman's, how much of a tailwind did that have in terms of the margin expansion, so the greater share of Mercer versus Oliver Wyman in the quarter?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: So there's a couple of things. I think I'll hand over to Mark in a second, and maybe even to Scott to comment a little bit about Oliver Wyman. But as we've said before, Oliver Wyman's main competition, main competitors, are private companies, and so we've structured Oliver Wyman differently in terms of our expectation to match them up more with their competitive set and not necessarily with public companies, which essentially means over time we expect Oliver Wyman will outgrow the other three OpCos over stretches of time. But that higher level of growth will come with volatility because Oliver Wyman's business, by its very nature, has much, much less recurring revenue than the other three operating companies. And so when we look at actual earnings performance for the segment based upon size and also just its structure of recurring revenue, Mercer is generally the driver of earnings performance within that segment in most circumstances. But, Mark, do you have anything to add to that?
Mark Christopher McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Maybe just a little bit, Dan. As I said earlier, Oliver Wyman tends to be more of a top line issue than a bottom line issue just the way they're comp is geared. And also remember, we signaled this weakness coming, and Scott and Oliver Wyman did a great job in the quarter knowing that it was going to be a little bit soft, managing very defensively. So they were able to put up a pretty good result in the context of that tough top line. And as Dan said, the proportion of Oliver or the contribution of Oliver Wyman to the overall Consulting segment – the segment is dominated by Mercer and Mercer did pretty well. So they had relatively strong growth in the quarter and good underlying earnings growth.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you and good morning. Just follow up on the – drill down a little bit more detail on expense side. If you look at the Consulting down 6% year over year in dollar amounts, assuming most of that is Oliver Wyman, and then on the risk solutions, Risk and Insurance Services, the other operating expense down 9% year over year. Just wonder, any particular driver behind that.
Mark Christopher McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: I mean when we look at our overall expense growth as a company, it was minus 1% in the quarter on an underlying basis, so I think you have to look more at underlying, get the FX out of there. And so when we look at the year-to-date for the company, we've grown revenue 3% year-to-date as a company and our expenses are up 2% year-to-date. In the quarter, obviously, underlying revenue was 1% and our expense growth in the quarter was minus 1% on an underlying basis. I think that's the more accurate way of looking at it.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then a follow-up. This quarter sounds like in adjustments you have $30 million of reduction in term of like a change in earn-out from acquisitions. What's behind that? Is that signals the growth in the acquisition was below expectation or anything else on that? Thanks.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Mark, why don't you give us a little bit of a history of that contingent consideration and then what it's doing this quarter?
Mark Christopher McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah, so Kai, we did have one adjustment this quarter. That was actually a downward revision in expected earn-out payment as you said, and just a couple of things on that. Generally these earn-outs, they probably average three years, but they can range from two to four . And that's a relatively short period of time to make a call on the fundamental success of an acquisition over a long period of time. The other thing, this was a pretty unusual adjustment actually, because if you look over the last 15 quarters, this is the first quarter in the last 15 where we've had an adjustment go this way. So whether we're talking about this specific acquisition or the vast majority of all the deals we've done over the last several years, we are very happy with the way they're performing, and this one in particular.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks. Next question please.
Operator: We'll go next to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, thanks. First on Guy Carpenter, we saw a slowdown in the growth there this quarter. How do you think I guess about the fourth quarter and going forward on that business, and anything just that drove the slowdown sequentially in the third quarter?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Well first of all, I'll say a couple of things and then hand over to Peter. I think Guy Carpenter has been more than holding its own through some pretty difficult markets. And so if you look at nine months, they've grown 2%, which is compared to nine months growth of 1% the year before. So in a difficult environment, they're doing it pretty well. But we have had some leadership change and we have had some injection of talent, so our expectations are high for Guy Carpenter going forward. But, Peter, you want to add to that?
Peter Zaffino - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure, Dan. Elyse, in the third quarter certainly zero is a disappointing result, but as Dan said, it's better to look at the year-to-date. And the year-to-date underlying organic growth is 2%. The third quarter is a much smaller quarter when compared to the first and second, and actually only about 20% of the revenue in the third quarter incepts in that particular quarter. So it's just susceptible to more adjustments than perhaps the earlier part of the year. I feel very good about our new business, which is a key metric within Guy Carpenter. They had a terrific new business quarter in terms of winning accounts. And I'm really encouraged by Peter Hearn's arrival. He is a relentless leader on growth. He has been very focused on our global business, meeting with clients, meeting with colleagues. Our pipeline for new opportunities is strong as it's been in the recent past, and the pipeline to acquire talent is very strong. So I'm really encouraged by what we see. And as Dan said, Guy Carpenter has really performed well in a challenging market environment.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Anything else, Elyse?
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. In terms of the capital return plan, you guys probably have about $900 million or so for the fourth quarter to get to that $2.3 billion for the full year; if you adjust for your dividends, probably a little over $700 million between acquisitions and share repurchase. If you could just any commentary around how you see the deal flow in terms of acquisitions flowing through in the fourth quarter? And how you think about the breakdown between potential acquisitions and share repurchase?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Well, it's interesting because, as you know, we don't have a budget at all for acquisitions, but we run a global pipeline. And similarly to last year, our pipeline in the first half of the year was a little softer than typical, but, boy, it's picked up. And the pipeline's pretty full. So we're considering a number of different things, and so it's impossible to say right now how that's likely to fall between acquisitions and share repurchases. We continue our conversations. What we can say is the $2.3 billion is the number that in a balanced way we intend to return that capital to shareholders. It's unlikely to be less than that, and it may even be a little bit more than that. But that's where we are right now.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll go next...
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you. Next...
Operator: We'll go next to Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Good morning.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: In Risk and Insurance Services, the trailing 12-month margin is almost back to the highest level in your history. How much more can that expand? And is there a natural feeling on that number?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. I'm going to hand off to Peter in a second, but we've said a couple of times before. Peter and I have talked about this a lot. We don't really believe in margin targets in general. We'd much rather have growth targets, NOI targets, but margin seems a little bit false. We want the organization all the time to figure out ways of delivering more capability at lower cost. We are in a more-for-less business, and so our efforts to find the efficiency, improve our effectiveness, reduce the cost of delivery of greater levels of capability and value to clients, that's a journey that never ends, and so we'd rather not say, you know what this is a margin, and at that level nothing else can be done. Obviously, the higher the margin goes, the more we just want to grow with that higher margin without looking to have a big spread between revenue growth and expense growth, so it will naturally tighten, but we could have easily had called that turn three years or four years ago but we would have been absolutely wrong. So we like to let it just run for a while. But, Peter, do you have some comments on that?
Peter Zaffino - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure, Dan. I want to reiterate that it really is best to look at the year-to-date margin expansion. I mentioned in the first quarter that in the medium to long-term if you're growing at a 2% to 3%, it's probably more challenging to expand margin at the pace that we have. Having said that, we've been very disciplined in terms of how we anticipate the growth and what the expense growth can be within the quarters and the years. And we have invested and planted a lot of seeds for not only growth, but also operational efficiency, and we believe that is starting to pay off. We have been able to expand margin despite wearing the amortization for all of the acquisitions that we've done over a period of time, and we're optimistic that we can continue to grow the top line greater than our expense.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Anything else, Sarah?
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: No, thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Next question please.
Operator: We'll go next to Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah, good morning. Thank you. First, on the U.S. DB plan closure at the end of this year, do you think that there's any risk that there could be greater turnover in your employee base next year as you're the last standing on offering the DB program for U.S. employees? Maybe that was something keeping people in seats.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. It's a good question. I'd start by saying that we're a company that cares deeply for our colleagues, so we don't take pension decisions lightly. Several years ago, we adopted a general philosophy that favors DC plans over DB. And we actually wrote a document and published it within our HR department. And that philosophy had more to do with risk and volatility than with P&L or cash contribution considerations. You may recall that in 2014 we closed and froze our U.K. plans. The U.K. plans were our highest, largest plans and they represented about 50% of our overall global plan liabilities. And so we really over the course of the last 18 months or so confronted ourselves as a global firm, and basically said that we had an obligation to follow the same philosophy, which was favoring DC in the U.S. as we do in the rest of the world. So it was more to do with being a global firm, not a U.S. multinational that we made this decision.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And I guess then on the growth side, curious if you could give any color on whether not just maybe this quarter but this year if the growth you guys are seeing in either of the businesses, but more particularly on the RIS, is due to some of the new initiatives that you had previously mentioned? I guess I'm trying to get some color on is your growth coming from traditional just account wins in traditional P&C businesses? Or is it being led by data and analytics or cyber or other initiatives that you guys have introduced over the last couple of years? Thanks.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. So it's a good question. I think I'll handle it a little bit and then walk around with our OpCos and have them talk a little bit about their feelings about growth because I really do think that's the core issue. Now clearly, macro factors have been challenging for a number of years, but we've managed to grow underlying revenue in the 3% to 5% range for the past six years. 3% to 5% is the likely outcome for us in 2016 as well. We're 3% through nine months, but being 3% through nine months we would look at it as we're likely on the lower end of that range for the year, but there's a lot going on underneath it. So why don't we start with Peter, and then I'll move to Julio and then Scott just to talk about their growth outlook a little bit. So, Peter?
Peter Zaffino - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Yeah. Just adding, Dan, to what I said in terms of narrative for the quarter and the year-to-date, the first part of the growth is looking at how you're retaining your clients and we have had terrific retention on clients. The next is certainly are you winning new business in the market. And when I look at our new business growth, I'm really pleased with what we see across the world, many contributions from many countries and we've been able to grow the business quite well. Again, there's definitely been some headwinds in the market with global macroeconomic issues as well as insurance pricing. They've largely been headwinds. But then we've been able to grow in 26 consecutive quarters of underlying organic growth. So the business is built to drive underlying organic growth. You've mentioned a couple of places where we're growing. They're not material to the overall today, but we're excited about it. Cyber is a big part of our innovation. We've developed programs in the London market, which prearrange $50 million of capacity for clients across the world. We have launched for smaller commercial clients capability through our MGA and through nine months we've had over 4,000 quotes with a take up of around 15%. We're planting seeds in flood. We have a digital capability that will expand and position us differently in the small end of commercial. I think when Dan references the investments that we're making; it's about focusing on growth and efficiencies in order to enable us to invest more in growth over time and feel like the company is really well positioned to do that.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Peter. Julio, you want to talk a little bit?
Julio A. Portalatin - Mercer LLC: Yeah. Thank you. The Mercer portfolio, as you know, is a very global portfolio that's diversified, very balanced by geography, line of business and client segments across the globe. At any given quarter, you can have some puts and takes along the way, but consistently we've been able to deliver growth and margin expansion and profitability growth. And we continue to invest to ensure that our growth is solid, whether you talk about expanding our solutions in talent with our purchase in the Workday space, implementation space with Jeitosa, CPSG; also investment in executive remuneration by our acquisition of Kepler; and expanding our geographic presence capabilities through investments in improving footprints in places like Africa; expanding our investment management capabilities with alternatives in Switzerland under SEM acquisition; or strengthening our presence in Asia with HRBS and Brazil with GAMA. And, of course, new solutions, new organic solutions that we're pressing on with, the Pension Risk Exchange in the U.S., UK and Canada have now been launched. And Mercer Match investing in research offerings, and also LifetimePlus in Australia market, Mercer Match, PeoplePro, all these things that are digitally oriented in many cases are really to be able to expand our capabilities, to ensure that we are reaching the full breadth of client segments and their demands in a growing world that has different demands along that continuum. So the needs are changing, we're ahead of those needs, we're continuing to invest, and it is truly a global growth story.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you very much.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Scott? Thanks. Why don't we just finish up with Scott talking about Oliver Wyman a little bit on the growth side, Charles?
Scott McDonald - Oliver Wyman Group: Okay. Sure, Dan. Despite our pretty weak Q3, we remain very confident in the outlook for Oliver Wyman. We can already see a rebound in Q4, although we have some pretty tough comparables in Q4 and Q1 next year. And our growth is coming from some very traditional spots. First of all, we're expanding into new sectors like health, public sector, retail, transportation, that's all growing well. Secondly, our growth market in Asia, Middle East, Latin America are all growing very strongly. Third, we're expanding into new areas for us or building areas like data, analytics, a lot more around digital solutions, functional capabilities, operations, organizations, things like that. And then two other areas, I mean, we're expanding the size of our relationships, the length and size of projects through a lot of work around client management and development of our senior teams. And then finally, the Oliver Wyman brand is just growing in strength. The franchise is getting stronger; we think that will give us a boost over the years to come.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Scott. And sorry Charles, but I thought growth is the key issue in a 1% underlying growth quarter, so I wanted to make sure that we treated it fully.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you very much for all the answers.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Next question please.
Operator: We'll go next to Dave Styblo with Jefferies.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: All right. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Maybe I'll just dovetail on the response and thanks for all that color on around the world trip of growth there. I'm curious; again, it's a little bit hard from the outside perspective to see where some of these opportunities are versus what the run rate of investments are. Is there any situations here where you really think the expenses or investments that you put forth to fuel this growth might be higher than the revenue for a shorter period of time? I know sometimes you do that as we say in a purposeful way and I'm curious if we should expect that to be coming up in the next couple of quarters as you pursue this growth?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Looking at a couple of things; one, clearly when you're buying back shares you have a more immediate EPS impact forgetting about revenue growth but really just focusing on short-term delivery to shareholders and acquisitions are more about building a company for the mid- to long-term, and oftentimes have a negative impact in the short term on EPS, either through amortization or restructuring charges or anything, integration types of issues. We are absolutely focused when we look at building our company through acquisition on getting better; either that's getting better by geography, by segment, by capability. We look at things which are growing at least as fast as we are or preferably faster than we are, in companies that we can acquire at our multiple or lower. Now clearly, and you've heard it from many people before, the multiples have risen over the last five or six years, and so there's a tighter frame around execution and you have to make sure that the perfume of an acquisition does not entice you to do something that shouldn't be done. But we are a very disciplined company, and as you can see by not only our revenue growth but also our earnings growth over a number of years across 120 acquisitions, that most of them are performing at or better than what our expectations have been.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: That's helpful. Great. And then just on the M&A, you did talk a little bit about the pipeline ticking up; seems to be stronger than it has been in the first half. I'm sure you don't want to comment about the rumors out there from AXA and so forth, but beyond that, can you pinpoint a little bit more what sort of opportunities are coming to fruition that are in the pipeline, if they're more on the RIS side, Consulting side? Any of that color would be really helpful.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I don't think it's a good idea to speculate about what we could be looking at in real-time, so I'll bring it back a little bit and say in general we are prepared to invest as a company in both the RIS segment and the Consulting segment. We are pursuing growth. We want to acquire things that make us better, and so from that standpoint we've got a broad platform in which to explore not only businesses within our core, but also adjacencies as well. And we're a global company, so we will look everywhere in the world. Although as you've seen in terms of the actual deals that we've done, we have favored the U.S. and UK over other jurisdictions just based on a number of factors, but that's where most of our money has landed over the last five years. But next question, please?
Operator: We'll go next to Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I just had a follow-up on Charles Sebaski's question on closing the U.S. defined benefit plans. I think it's more on the financial side and the people side, so maybe it's a question for Mark. But just, I guess thinking about the timing of doing that, the decision to do it now, and I wanted to make sure I'm thinking about that right, because it seems like to me you're effectively locking in a higher level of pension expense, kind of commensurate with sub-2% interest rates going forward, but you'll be eliminating the interest rate volatility like going forward. And I just wanted to make sure I'm thinking about the risk/reward of that correctly. And then more specifically, I was curious if this has any impact next year on the cash flow statement? So we've talked about the income statement. You should be able to mitigate it. But does the move into more DC mean more cash pension expense? Thanks.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Please, it's Mark, that sounds like you.
Mark Christopher McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you very much. You know, just a couple of things, Peter, to your question. Think of the timing more as what Dan said earlier. This is just part of a multi-year strategy. So we've, as opposed to taking a one size fits all or one shot approach to this, we've over the last several years been addressing risk in that part of our business. And the U.S. is the latest step in that line and it's linked to our philosophy. Really we should think about this as addressing long-term risk and volatility as opposed to anything that'll have a meaningful impact on earnings or cash flow in the near term. And so I think if you think about it that way, that's the right way to approach it.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: That enough, Ryan?
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Yeah. Just real quick as a follow-up, I guess in the near term, I know this year pension has helped margins. Is it too early to tell next year whether or not any of these changes to pensions are going to produce a net tailwind or a headwind? And thanks.
Mark Christopher McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: As we said in the second quarter and I just reiterated earlier, our outlook at this point is that we'll be able to effectively mitigate any retirement expense volatility. So as we sit here today, I just wouldn't expect, as we're sitting here today, wouldn't expect any positive or negative.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Next question, please. Thank you. Take care.
Operator: We'll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: On the national flood risk, that government entity could be looking to shift more of that exposure to the private market. Could you discuss the opportunity there, kind of long-term, since Guy Carpenter was named in the document as the broker?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. I'll start by broadly talking about governments in general, not just in the United States. I think that there's a large opportunity in areas of property and casualty, and also in healthcare and retirement savings for governments, indebted governments to look at ways to where the private market can be more instructive and be utilized in a greater way. I think that there is in P&C a protection gap and a bit of moral hazard in certain countries in terms of the government programs that are providing certain coverage that doesn't have risk management associated with it. So I think the insurance market writ large has a big role to play. But, Peter, you want to talk about the U.S. flood program specifically?
Peter Zaffino - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. I mean, I'm not going to go into too much detail, but you're right. We were awarded the first reinsurance agreement for FEMA. We're very active on the Marsh side as well in terms of the National Flood Insurance Program. I think you will see a trend continue that there's more of a private and public balance in terms of solution for flood. Guy Carpenter's built tremendous capabilities in its ability to model, assess and be very creative in solutions for flood and expect them to add tremendous value in helping assemble a program that's going to work.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Any other question, Jay?
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. I guess this is for Julio. I heard something in the prepared remarks about 1.5 million lives in the Mercer marketplace. I didn't know if that was for the 2017 enrollment year. That would imply flat growth because that will be down from like 43% growth last year.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. So, Julio, you want to take that one?
Julio A. Portalatin - Mercer LLC: All right. Thanks, Jay. Mercer has always been balanced and measured about the exchange space, as you know. The Mercer Marketplace 365 journey has and continues to be an innovation that's full of learnings along the way as anything else that we invest. It also continues to be small in the full scheme of things, whether at the global health level or the Mercer level or even more so on the MMC level. For 2016 selling season we did have softer conversion rates on sales, something that I mentioned during our last call, in fact. And additionally we had decision delays that were seen particularly in the large market segments. And there was also some attrition, as you would expect now three years in, inclusive of one client in particular that accounted for a large portion of the last results. So these dynamics, as I just mentioned, resulted in a number of lives being flat year-on-year at approximately 1.5 million.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Jay. Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you very much. In your opening remarks you mentioned lots of opportunity for growth in newer markets like Latin American and Asia. Some of your competitors boast growth in areas like Russia or China, and maybe you can talk a little about the risks, regulatory-wise and legal-wise, of growing in emerging markets, and whether that's profitable growth and how you think about that?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah, I mean there's a couple of things. It's a very good question and that's why companies like ours have big controls and systems around managing growth in different places around the world. You can't look at growth in the developing world in exactly the same way as you look at it in a developed world. We actually believe we have opportunities for growth throughout the developed and developing world and, in fact, some of our strongest areas of growth over the last year or so has come from pretty traditional countries like Japan and Germany, so from that – and so we're open to the ability of more brokerage penetration in even parts of the developed world. In taking your question, if we were growing super strong in certain countries, you can grow too fast in certain places too. The good things about intermediaries versus some capital providers in some of these territories is pretty inexpensive for us to plant a flag and have people on the ground and provide good levels of service. So our margins in the developing world are not that dissimilar to our margins in places where we have a lot more infrastructure. But we do look at the risk associated with growth. In fact, if you look at our executive team we essentially work on four categories of issues: growth strategies, financial performance, people issues and risk issues. That occupies almost all of the time of the executive committee, and so risk is always on the table when we're looking at growth. Any other question?
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No. Thank you very much.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Josh. Any other question, operator?
Operator: Yes, sir. We'll go next to Jay Cohen with Bank of America.
Jay Arman Cohen - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. A couple of things. One, you talked about Europe offsetting some of the growth in the UK. Can you give us an update what's happening in Europe?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. So that's a specific question in RIS and maybe even more specifically to Marsh, so without going country-by-country, Peter, why don't you just talk about EMEA a little bit and specifically Continental Europe.
Peter Zaffino - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Okay. As we've said, we had good growth in the UK, was offset by Continental Europe and the Middle East. There were a few discrete items, insurance pricing and macro conditions were a factor, had actually solid new business. And the one thing just to keep in mind is it's the seasonally smallest quarter for Continental Europe by a fairly wide margin and so sometimes those discrete items can have an impact in a particular quarter. But we have had macro headwinds and insurance pricing headwinds in that part of the world for the better part of a few years now.
Jay Arman Cohen - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay. Then my other area that it looked like it was kind of a slowdown from the recent trend was in health and benefits. I don't know how much that is Mercer marketplace or is there something else going on that resulted in that slowdown within Mercer?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: I wouldn't call it a slowdown. I'll hand off to Julio, but I believe H&B is up like 5% on a year-to-date basis. Is that right, Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin - Mercer LLC: Yeah, that's right, Dan, thanks. As I mentioned, the overall Mercer portfolio is really diversified and balanced geographically across the globe, so it's really a global picture that you have to take a look at when you think about overall growth and you bring it down by line of business, portfolio, client segments, there can be some puts and takes, as you know, across the portfolio in any given quarter, including tough comparisons versus prior year et cetera. But as Dan mentioned, feeling fairly good about our year-to-date health growth at 5%.
Jay Arman Cohen - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: We'll focus on that, then.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Jay.
Operator: We'll go next to Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.
J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: You covered most of the topics quite well. And I was hoping you could maybe take a step back and partially in light with the pension issue, but to look at the relationship between earnings and cash flow prospectively, how that may or may not change. Should we basically expect those things to move in lock step given the lack of restructuring charges that you've had in the distant past?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I mean our earnings, and Mark, you can add a little bit more, but generally over the last several years, there is a very tight relationship between our GAAP results and our adjusted results. And generally our earnings and our cash flow are very similar because there's not a lot of noise that is working through the system. Having said that, every time we bring in new leadership, we try to get them to – I know Peter and I in particular and Julio as well, we're open to the idea of looking at our businesses with fresh eyes, particularly when we bring new executive talent in, to try to figure out ways of being more efficient and to make decisions that would reduce our cost and improve our capabilities. So I never want to say that we'll never dip into that sort of thing where we have a restructuring charge or something, but ultimately I would say that for a number of years we are much tighter than the S&P 500 in terms of the relationship between GAAP results and adjusted results. But, Mark, do you have something to add to that?
Mark Christopher McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Just specifically, just to build on what Dan said, specifically to cash flow, if we look year-to-year there can be disconnects between earnings and cash flow. But when we look back over reasonably, couple year, two-year, three-year, four-year periods of time, the relationship between our adjusted net income and our free cash flow is pretty tight. And we expect both to grow over time.
J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Great. Thank you very much.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. I think, operator, we're about out. Maybe we can take one more question.
Operator: And we will go to Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah, thanks for putting me in just quickly here, Dan. The first one, just could you give us, Mark, what the year-over-year kind of benefit to margins was from pension expense? How much was the benefit on a year-over-year basis per quarter?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Mark, you want to take that?
Mark Christopher McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Very similar to what we saw in the second quarter. I mean if you take the pieces, you think about the $125 million credit we had last year that was onetime and how we talked about this year expense going down to replace that, and overall for the year retirement expense being down about $30 million, so you take that full package it gives you sort of the underlying drop in pension expense for the year, that is a good baseline, as we've talked about. And it happens pretty ratably over the course of the year, so I think with those pieces you can get at the rough impact to the quarter. But as we've said earlier, even if you take out the benefit in the quarter, the underlying performance of business was very strong. So even without any retirement benefits, both segments had strong performance in the quarter.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Got you. And then just quickly, any thoughts on some additional leverage on the balance sheet?
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: We're always open to it. As we said before, it would be unlikely for us to add leverage to the balance sheet just to buy back shares unless there was a severe market downturn and the opportunity just couldn't be resisted. But generally if it was acquisition-based then we would be open to increasing our leverage on the balance sheet perhaps even permanently. So we're not zealous with regard to guarding our 1.6x corporate debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Thank you. I think, operator, that pretty much covers the call. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us this morning. I just want to reiterate that I am very pleased with the third quarter and I'm looking forward to a strong close of the year. I'd like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. Hope everyone has a good day. Thank you very much.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to the Marsh & McLennan Companies conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. Second quarter 2016 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They’re available on the company’s Web site at www.mmc.com. Please note the remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release from this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC Web site. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today’s earnings release. I’ll now turn the call over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Dan Glaser: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I’m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is our CFO Mark McGivney, Peter Zaffino, the Chairman of the Risk and Insurance Services, Julio Portalatin, CEO of Mercer, Scott McDonald, CEO of Oliver Wyman and Keith Walsh of Investor Relations. Before moving on to our results, I thought I would spend a few minutes on Brexit, adding to my comments from our last earnings call. The UK vote to exit the EU created immediate uncertainty and volatility in capital markets throughout the world. However, over the last month, we’ve seen a recovery from the initial surprise of the event. Although it is too soon to predict the ultimate effects of the UK’s decision, it will have implications for some of our clients. In any circumstance, Brexit will likely lead to a multiyear period of uncertainty. MMC’s top priority remains supporting our clients and colleagues in the UK and throughout Europe. Our clients will need advice around key issues such as changes in regulatory perspectives on capital requirements, cross-border implications for employee benefit programs, work visa arrangements, and the need to restructure UK operations in light of negotiations on passporting and the free movement of people. We are uniquely positioned to guide our clients through these challenges. At the same time, we are also addressing how Brexit could affect our own operations. One key question is the potential impact on the London insurance market. London is the global sector of insurance and, in our view, will likely remain so in a post-Brexit world. While underwriters will adapt over time, our geographic footprint in every EU country offers us the ability to serve clients, regardless of where they are located or do business. Beyond the UK, we have 110 offices spread throughout the remaining 27 EU member countries. Fundamentally, we operate through subsidiaries rather than branches across the EU. We view capital as fungible, and we are able to place risk anywhere in the world, helping our clients avoid Brexit-related disruption around pricing, terms and conditions and access to capacity in the market. In the short term, the uncertainty in the UK will likely cause some clients to defer projects and investments, which can impact our revenue growth in the UK and Continental Europe. However, we believe as time passes and the political way forward becomes clearer, clients will need our help determining the best way for them to proceed strategically and structurally. Marsh and Guy Carpenter will help clients reassessed their risk and insurance needs as they try to protect against stress on capital and credit positions. We will also help clients monitor economic and political risks and the associated business consequences. Clients will seek Mercer’s assistance with mobility and workforce planning as they consider their future organizational structures and locations. Mercer will also help with employee rewards and executive compensation design, and there may be a need for investment and asset allocation strategic advice. Oliver Wyman will play a key role helping clients with corporate strategy as they consider their competitive positioning throughout Europe and potential need to restructure their UK operations. I also want to comment on the current state of the P&C insurance industry. The market remains favorable for clients, as pricing continues to decline in an orderly manner in most circumstances. Our Marsh global rate index continues to show mid-single-digit decreases across major products and geographies, with the steepest declines in the UK and U.S. property. On the reinsurance side, we are beginning to see some moderation in rate declines, especially in U.S. pricing. Recent headlines have focused on cat pre-announcements among underwriters. However, while insured natural catastrophe losses climbed over 40% in the first half of 2016, they are in line with what we have seen over the past decade. Capital remains abundant across major global markets, with surplus exceeding $1 trillion. Low interest rates are also squeezing profits for insurance carriers, as new money yields are lower than previous years. And reserve releases appear to be slowing after a decade a favorable development. All together, this translates into returns likely below the cost of capital net of reserve releases for a large portion of the P&C industry. We would expect this to ultimately stabilize pricing, though it may take some time. To be clear, we don’t anticipate industry pricing dynamics changing anytime soon. As history has shown us, some insurers will continue to write business at lower returns in declining rate environments and, in fact, will actually write more new business when rates are falling than when rates are rising. This is a topic we touched upon on our last earnings call. While there is ample capacity to place comprehensive programs at competitive prices, we believe there is an opportunity for the industry to provide greater value to clients. Success in our industry is increasingly based on delivering what matters to clients: service, breadth of products, coverage innovation, contract certainty, claims performance, responsiveness, and, yes, competitive pricing. Even in this tough market environment, underwriters continue to offer new products and services that meet the growing risk needs of our clients. And this bodes well for our industry to grow and enhance the value we deliver. On the healthcare side, we’ve seen recent news about proposed health insurer consolidation in the U.S. There is continued uncertainty regarding outcomes, especially in light of the recently filed DOJ lawsuits to block two possible mergers. Mercer will continue to be a trusted advisor regardless of the outcome of these proposed mergers. We will help our clients navigate all the options to design and implement benefit programs that are high quality and cost-effective for employees and their families. Now, let me turn to our results. MMC produced solid operating performance in the second quarter with underlying revenue growth across all four of our operating companies, margin expansion, and 14% growth in adjusted earnings per share. MMC’s revenue of $3.4 billion was the largest quarter in our history. Consolidated underlying revenue growth was 3%, with excellent growth in profitability. Operating income rose 15% or 14% on an adjusted basis. For the six-month period, underlying revenue growth was 4% with margin expansion in both segments and 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, second-quarter revenue increased 6%, with both Marsh and Guy Carpenter contributing. Underlying revenue growth was 2%. Adjusted operating income increased double-digits, with the margin expanding 140 basis points to 26.8%, our highest second-quarter margin since 1988. I’m excited about the addition of top-flight leadership talent into RIS reporting to Peter Zaffino. There are no finer P&C executives than John Doyle, the president of Marsh, and Peter Hearn, the president and CEO of Guy Carpenter. I’m certain that John and Peter will have a positive impact on MMC. I would like to give a special acknowledgment to Alex Moczarski and thank him for his leadership of Guy Carpenter over the past five years. We all look forward to working with Alex in his role as Chairman, MMC International. The Consulting segment also delivered a strong quarter, with revenue increasing 4%. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 5%, with both Mercer and Oliver Wyman producing solid underlying revenue growth. Adjusted operating income increased by double-digits, and the adjusted operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 18.7%, the segment’s highest second-quarter margin in over 30 years. In summary, we are pleased with our second-quarter results. We are a trusted advisor helping our clients address the issues of the day relating to risk, strategy, and people. Demand for our advice and services increases in a world filled with uncertainty. We have a leadership team that has proven its ability to grow revenue, expand margins, and improve earnings each year over multiple years. And we have the financial strength and resources to manage through periods of stress and capitalize on opportunities. Notwithstanding the headlines and the noise in the market, we expect to deliver another year of excellent financial performance in 2015. For the full year, we continue to expect underlying revenue growth to be within 3% to 5% range that we have operated in for the past six years. Meaningful margin expansion in both segments, and strong EPS growth at a level approaching our long-term target of 13% – all this while continuing to invest in our future and return capital to shareholders through dividends and substantial share repurchase. With that, let me turn it over to Mark to review our second-quarter results in more detail.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, MMC delivered strong results driven by underlying revenue growth in each of our operating companies while continuing to actively manage expenses. Overall revenue was up 5%, and underlying revenue increased 3%. Adjusted operating income increased by double-digits, and our overall margin expanded by 190 basis points. GAAP EPS rose 17% to $0.90, and adjusted EPS increased 14% to $0.91. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, second-quarter revenue was $1.8 billion with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income increased 11% to $493 million, with the margin expanding 140 basis points to 26.8%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 6%. The top line was bolstered by quality acquisitions such as Jelf in the UK and continued activity in Marsh & McLennan Agency. On an underlying basis, revenue rose 2%. Underlying growth was 4% in the International division. EMEA increased a solid 3% with growth across all regions. Asia-Pacific was up 2%, and Latin America had strong growth of 11%. In the U.S, Canada division, underlying revenue was flat. We continue to see pressure in Canada and in parts of the U.S, largely driven by commodity-related headwinds. Guy Carpenter’s revenue was $285 million, an increase of 3% on both a reported and underlying basis, another good performance. Growth was highlighted by strong new business across Asia-Pacific, EMEA, and Global Specialties. Guy Carpenter has produced positive underlying revenue growth in 28 of the past 30 quarters. In the Consulting segment, revenue rose 4% to $1.5 billion, or 5% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 18% to $288 million, and the adjusted operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 18.7%. Mercer’s revenue increased 3% to $1.1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 4%. Solid growth in the quarter reflects the benefits of a diversified portfolio. Investments and Talent both rose 5%; Health increased 5%; and Retirement was up 2%. All major geographic regions contributed, led by growth market. Oliver Wyman continued to perform well. Revenue was $450 million, reflecting solid growth of 5% on both a reported and underlying basis. Growth was well distributed, with particular strength in Europe and other international markets. In the third quarter, we expect to see a decline in underlying revenue from Oliver Wyman. This is driven by comparisons to very strong growth in the Financial Services practice last year as well as global growth concerns exacerbated by Brexit uncertainty. As Dan said, we continue to expect that for 2016 we will generate underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, increased operating margins in both segments, and strong growth in earnings per share. I’d like to take a – make a few comments about our global retirement plan. We normally discuss the outlook for retirement plan expense after we have completed the annual year-end measurement process. However, given the declines in global interest rates, we want to share some thoughts that might be helpful to investors. We monitor our retirement programs on an ongoing basis. Previously, we discussed several changes that have reduced the sensitivity of our retirement expense to interest rates. As we have said many times, we view retirement expense as just one component of overall expense, which we actively manage. We have been effective at mitigating retirement plan volatility and limiting the impact to shareholders over the past couple of years. Based on where we stand today, we expect to do so in 2017. Moving to investment income, we recognized $1 million in the second quarter, a decrease from $3 million a year ago. For 2016, we expect to generate only modest investment income compared with $38 million we reported in 2015. On our last earnings call we estimated the impact from foreign exchange would be de minimis for the remainder of 2016. As expected, the effect of foreign exchange on adjusted EPS was negligible in the second quarter, and our outlook for the rest of the year has not changed. There has been recent volatility in the British pound. Weakening of the pound has a minimal overall impact to MMC. This is because RIS has a natural hedge created by U.S. dollar placements in London. While the impact of a weakening pound to MMC in total is not significant, there would be a benefit to RIS, offset by an adverse impact to Consulting. Our tax rate fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years, and other items. Our adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was 29.1%, compared with 27.4% in the same quarter last year. Through the first half of the year, our adjusted tax rate was 28.8%, compared with 28.5% in last year’s first half. Based on the current landscape, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% for the remainder of 2016. Corporate debt at June 30 was $4.8 billion, which declined from $5 billion at the end of the first quarter due to a reduction in commercial paper outstanding. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us flexibility, with modest near-term repayment obligations. Our next debt maturity is 250 million of senior notes due next April. In the second quarter, we repurchased $3.5 million shares of our stock for $225 million. Through six months we used $425 million to buy back 7 million shares. The second quarter marked the 70th consecutive quarter we have bought back our stock, and we have reduced shares outstanding nine quarters in a row. Since announcing our commitment to reduce our annual share count at Investor Day in March 2014, shares outstanding have declined by 30 million or 5%. Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $974 million, with approximately $170 million in the U.S. Uses of cash in the second quarter included $225 million for share repurchases, $155 million for dividends, and $47 million for acquisitions. For the first six months uses of cash included $425 million for share repurchases, $326 million for dividends, and $168 million for acquisitions. For the full-year 2016, we continue to expect to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital through dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions, and investments. We also expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividends per s hare by double-digits. With that, I’m happy to turn it back to Dan.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Mark. Jamie, we’re ready to turn to the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll take our first question Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan.
Sarah DeWitt: Hi, good morning. On the brokerage organic growth, I think you said last quarter the 2% was tempered by the profile of the book that renewed that quarter. This quarter I was a little surprised that it didn’t rebound. Was there anything that was tempering it again?
Dan Glaser: Well, before I hand over to Peter, I would just say that in general when you look at the size of Marsh, it’s in every country which has an insurance profile, many different segments, many different moving parts within the business. So it really gets a very broad array of areas in which they can grow. Wherever there is growth, we’re on the ground to capture it. But I think the reality is, as you’ve seen from a lot of the insurance company reporting, it’s a pretty tough market out there. The P&C rating levels are under a fair amount of pressure. There’s a significant amount of competition amongst brokers, et cetera, which is having an impact. But I do think you have to look at it on a mix basis. International did quite well; U.S./Canada was under a bit more pressure. But Peter, you want to give us some more color on this?
Peter Zaffino: Sure, Dan. Just to pick up on what you just said, International I think we had a terrific quarter, strong organic growth in all major geographies. Some of the highlights were: Latin America we had 11% underlying organic growth, but also over 15% new business growth. We had some real strong performances in Asia. And in EMEA having 3% growth in the second quarter was terrific, and it was led by strong new business in Continental Europe. If we go and shift into the U.S. and Canada, again each quarter is really quite different. Overall, we’re not pleased with 0% growth in the quarter, but it is just one quarter. The fundamentals of the business are sound. What are some of the fundamentals we look at? Certainly the renewal book; and when we look at client retention it was at historic highs. We’ve done really well, strong new business. The challenge is we had a really tough comparable year-over-year on new business in the U.S. and Canada division. It was a record in the second quarter of 2015; we had a lot more nonrecurring new business than we have had historically. We matched that new business in this particular quarter, but it was hard to grow year-over-year. And that nonrecurring business did have an impact of not having the renewal line grow as much as we’ve seen in the past. The division continues to be challenged by Canada, which is particularly exposed to commodity prices. We’ve talked about this in the past: project work which does mute a little bit of the new business. And despite the cats that we saw in Canada in the quarter, insurance pricing is still a headwind. And then just one last comment on another variable – Dan mentioned it in his opening comments – is that while the rate decreases are orderly, they sequentially have increased a little bit on the property side in the U.S. And that had a little bit of an impact as well. But again, I look at client retention, new business, and the underlying performance of the fundamentals, and I think U.S. and Canada will do well as it has historically when we look at the full year
Dan Glaser: Yes. The other thing I would just say, Sarah, would be this was not a surprise to Peter and the Marsh team, as you see by the expanded margin within RIS. So this has been – this was planned for in terms of what we saw six months ago as a likely outcome on the top line. Any other questions?
Sarah DeWitt: Okay, great. Yes, and then just following up on the RIS margin, could you just elaborate on what’s driving that strong growth, given the 2% organic?
Dan Glaser: Well, what we said about margins in the past is you really shouldn’t look at any individual quarter; that certainly on a year-to-date basis when we get further along in the year or on a rolling four-quarters basis is the best way to look at margins. The reality is both RIS and Consulting, we have had significant efficiency gains over multiple periods of time. So when we look at the expansion of the margins, it’s been pretty consistent over multiple years. I was just looking the other day in the second quarter over a five-year period: the margin for RIS is up almost 500 basis points, and for Consulting about 600 basis points. So there has been a consistent level of significant margin expansion. We expect 2015 to be a good year for margin expansion, despite the slow growth environment within RIS.
Sarah DeWitt: Great. Thanks for the answers.
Dan Glaser: Sure. Next question please.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Larry Greenberg with Janney.
Larry Greenberg: Hi, good morning. I guess this one’s for Peter, too. It seems like there’s more activity for major quota shares going on. I’m just curious if that impression is correct. And if so, what’s driving it? Is it nothing more than the softness in the reinsurance markets and accommodations being made there?
Dan Glaser: A couple of things and then I’ll hand off to Peter, Larry. The one thing you have to know is that organizations like Marsh and others are always searching for ways of delivering increased value to clients. And that value is both in the advisory side, which probably has had even more increased value to clients over the last several years than any other area; but it also touches the transactional side as well. And clearly, whether it’s quota shares or specific types of facilities, there has been some level of increase in that over the last few years. Whether that is a permanent feature of the landscape or a factor of the current market conditions, time will tell. But, Peter, do you have something to add to that?
Peter Zaffino: Yes, I think, Dan, to add to what you said, our strategy with respect to any facilities, our quota shares is always to lead with client value, put together dedicated capacity where we think there’s a need in the market. The most recent example for us is that we launched a terrorism facility, which is led by five very strong lead markets; we’re able to put together $250 million of capacity for anywhere in the world from the leads, and then we have another $250 million of following capacity. So to be able to have $500 million of capacity for value for clients anywhere in the world really does generate value. And to do that on a syndicated individual basis would be near-on impossible for all of our clients across the world. So we’re always focused on client value and bringing capacity to the market where there is need.
Larry Greenberg: Just – it seemed like a relatively quiet quarter on the acquisition front. But can you give us the breakdown of the $47 million between RIS and Consulting?
Dan Glaser: Yes. Mark, you want to?
Mark McGivney: Larry, a lot of the activity in the second quarter was actually subsequent payout on acquisitions, so deferred payments. There were just a couple of very minor acquisitions. Most of the activity was subsequent payments on – and largely MMA acquisitions.
Dan Glaser: But you’re very right to identify that acquisitions through the first half of the year are not at the pace of what they were last year. I’ll just remind everybody that we don’t have any budget with regard to acquisitions. We look at a lot of things. We cultivate a lot of relationships. We have a lot of conversations. We don’t do very much at all. Even over the past years we’ve had a string-of-pearls strategy, and we’re continuing on that basis. So acquisitions by their very nature are going to be lumpy. Some years we’re going to have lots of them and some years we won’t have that much. I can tell you the back half of last year was more active than the first half of last year. I don’t know whether that’s going to be the case this year or not. Our pipelines are actually pretty good, but we’re a disciplined acquirer. So what I can say is that if acquisitions are lighter than normal in any given year, we are not seeking to build cash on our balance sheet, so we would use that, those funds, in other ways of creating value, whether that’s organic investment through strategic recruitment, whether that is increased share repurchase. That is – those are essentially avenues that we would take to make sure we’re putting our cash to work.
Larry Greenberg: Appreciate those thoughts. Thanks.
Dan Glaser: Sure. Next question please.
Operator: And we will go next to Quentin McMillan with KBW.
Quentin McMillan: Hi, good morning. Thanks very much, guys. Just to touch to the other side of the equation, Julio, the margin expansion in the quarter was really pretty phenomenal. So could you just help us qualitatively? Maybe give an example of our programs you’re working on to drive such high margin expansion. Then obviously Dan’s commentary in the press release indicated that you’re expecting meaningful margin expansion to continue. So again, just anything that can help us qualitatively understand what you guys are working on that’s helping to drive that and into the future.
Dan Glaser: Okay, so before I hand over to Julio, I just want to remind you that the margins are for the segment, not for individual operating companies. So the Consulting segment’s margins have expanded pretty dramatically, as I mentioned before, about 700 bps over the last five years, and there’s a lot of factors to do with that. As we’ve said in other calls in the past, the better the top-line performance, the better the opportunities for margin expansion certainly over time, over any stretch of time. But both Julio and Scott have done a number of things over the years to make sure that we’re positioned well to expand margins into the future. Julio, you want to comment in more detail?
Julio Portalatin: Sure. Thank you, and thanks for the question. As we’ve talked about in the past, Mercer is a pretty broad business and gives us a lot of different opportunities to align margin expansion and ensure that our top line and our expense growth has a lot of air between them over sustainable periods of time. So you see things that we make conscious decisions, like disinvesting in things that don’t give us the margin expansion or sustainability of profit contribution into the future. One of the more primary recent examples of that is when we decided to disinvest our DC record-keeping business and strike up a strategic relationship with a partner that we can continue to have as part of a bundled solution into the future. And we continue to make active decisions like that. Our continued efficiency in our consultancy and administration businesses is really a faucet around, a discipline around higher utilization, use of offshoring as another example of what we do to continue to drive efficiency and air between expenses and revenue. Also, the evolving mix of our business. There’s no question that as you look at the improvements in operating leverage, you see businesses that have that operating leverage being a more significant part of our mix. And that’s going to have a sustainable impact over the long run. Our continuous portfolio review is also part of our discipline now. We accelerate those things that give us margin accretiveness and we decelerate those things that don’t. So it’s really a lot about being very disciplined around ensuring that we’re building a business that can have strength both on the top line and the bottom line as we continue to grow. I just also want to mention that, importantly, our overall focus is still to increase and grow earnings. We’re confident that with the actions that we’ve taken and the actions that we continue to take, that we’ll be successful in doing just that.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Julio. I just want to caution everybody not to overly focus on one quarter when it comes to margins. That at the end of the day, look over longer stretches of time. The Consulting segment is up about 50 bps on a year-to-date basis. We expect that to improve over the course of the year, but we certainly don’t look at the 230 bps margin expansion in the quarter as being some sort of new run rate for the Consulting division. Your next question, please?
Quentin McMillan: Understood. Thanks very much for the color. One other quick question. Peter, you mentioned the historically high retention that you had in the quarter; but also talked about nonrecurring business. I know those are two separate things, but can you help us to understand how much of the book is business that you guys view as nonrecurring? And/or what is the typical type of nonrecurring business versus the rest of the book?
Dan Glaser: I’ll just take that a little bit and then hand over to Peter. I mean the one thing to bear in mind when we talk about client retention is retaining the client. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the income for that client is exactly what it was the year before. But, Peter, I don’t think we want to go into detail about recurring revenues and that sort of thing. But [indiscernible]
Peter Zaffino: No. I’ll just give one example. Construction or surety, there can be some project work; there could be some work within the private equity space that we have a very good business with in the United States. So if there’s more activity on new business in one particular quarter, that is a nonrecurring piece of the business. So we want to be very active in the construction business and private equity and make sure that we’re capturing all the new business opportunities. But that’s not the same as winning a property deal that will go into client retention and then renewal retention the following year. So that was a little bit more color on my comments from earlier. Thanks.
Quentin McMillan: Great; that’s helpful. Thanks very much.
Dan Glaser: Next question please.
Operator: And we will go next to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi: Thanks so much. Just want to talk a little bit more about U.S. and Canada. Obviously the organic was flat. But when I look back further, revenue in that geography is up like 30% in the last four years, which is, I think, better than any other subset in your business over that period. I’m guessing, obviously, MMC Agency is a big chunk of that. So I’m just trying to think about margins. Normally we think about margins relative to organic growth. But here, given the trajectory of margins in the segment, I’m guessing margins have expanded in the U.S. and Canada as well over that period. How should we think about the trajectory for the U.S./Canada business? How much more important are acquisitions here relative to organic when we think about top line, when we think about bottom line?
Dan Glaser: Well, there’s a couple of things. One, yes, you’re right when you’re looking at the overall revenue growth in U.S. and Canada; that is inclusive of acquisitions. And in fact, Marsh had a strong quarter on overall growth, and that really varies based upon the acquisitions which were done in the prior year. Clearly, one of the core strategic initiatives of the Company since 2009 has been the development of Marsh & McLennan Agency. And you can see through the contingent payments that we’ve made over the last several years that the Agency is – many parts of the Agency are performing better than what our expectations were when we acquired different agents. So, yes, there is – where you have an active acquisition strategy, then clearly the combination of active acquisitions, performance, and efficiency gains through acquisitions, combined with organic would have an impact on margin. I think it’s important – we talk about margins often, and we all recognize around this table that margins are an important feature. Margin expansion is an important feature of us delivering on our long-term CAGR of EPS of 13%. Having said that, I do want to reiterate to everybody that margins are about the last thing we talk about at an executive team level. We spend a lot of time on financial performance, organic growth strategies, acquisition strategies, people issues, risk issues. We believe that margin expansion is an outcome of running our business properly, not a goal in and of itself. So I just want to level-set with that. Peter, I don’t know if you have anything else to add to that.
Peter Zaffino: The only thing I would add is that the acquisition strategy is important to us, but that is not in lieu of growing each of our businesses organically. We focus on what investments we need to make in each of the components of our U.S. and Canada business in terms of how they can grow irrespective of acquisitions. But we have an active acquisition strategy where we have a very strong pipeline and believe that will supplement the organic growth in the U.S. and Canada Division.
Michael Nannizzi: Got it, thanks. I guess, so in thinking about that, the US/Canada then, is acquisition growth maybe not a driver, but is it an ingredient to margin expansion if you don’t have consistent organic growth? Does it help? Is it a tailwind to margin expansion?
Dan Glaser: Well, certainly, acquisitions done well and quality acquisitions that have higher growth than what your expectations were will create more value. But overall, I’ve got to tell you, Marsh & McLennan Agency has been a headwind to margin expansion for the segment. When you look at the amortization that we have added over a number of years, the net operating income margins of MMA now are lower than the margin for the greater segment. So from that perspective, over time that will become more of a tailwind as the amortization schedule falls off. But fundamentally, MMA has not been a help to Peter and his team on margins. And Peter and his team have proven – because even if you look over the last number of years – forgetting about the 2% growth within Marsh the last couple of quarters – Marsh over a number of years has averaged about 3%, which is really at the lower end of organic or underlying growth where we would expect to have any reasonable amount of margin expansion. But, knowing where we’re going to be, looking out into the future where we’re likely to be, and planning for it allows us to manage our expenses very carefully to where, in virtually every quarter, our revenue growth exceeds our expense growth. And when it doesn’t, it’s purposeful. We know it, we plan for it, and we decide to do it. So we’re not beholden to the fact that that it always have to happen that way. In fact, Peter and I talk all the time that for the right opportunities, organic or recruitment-wise, we will always go into the tank expense-wise to build a better business. So that is part of what we’re willing to do. But we’re seeking those opportunities. They don’t avail themselves all that often. So the net effect of running the business on a consistent basis where revenue growth exceeds expense growth means we’ll always have margin expansion.
Michael Nannizzi: Got it, great. And if I could sneak in a quick one just on the Consulting segment. I think, Mark, you mentioned about Oliver Wyman impact from Brexit in the UK. Any impact on Mercer that we should think about, or offsetting impact, just to keep in line with your outlook for mid-single-digit organic growth and margin expansion? Thanks.
Dan Glaser: Okay. Let me hand off to Scott a little bit just to talk a – give you a little bit more flavor on Oliver Wyman, which obviously over the last several years has been our fastest-growing operating company. But we’ve said many times in the past it will be our most volatile operating company as well because of the nature of its business. And then after Scott, we’ll hand over to Julio and just talk a little bit about Brexit and what you’re seeing at Mercer?
Julio Portalatin: Sure. Let me give you some context before I go straight to the third quarter. I mean, Oliver Wyman is a strong business and we’re very confident that over time we can grow it at mid to high single-digits, as we’ve indicated consistently. However, quarter-to-quarter there will be a fair bit of volatility. And the reason for that is that the majority of our revenues are nonrecurring and we need to generate them as new business every year. So in any one quarter, we can have very strong growth, like you’ve seen in first quarter of this year or through 2014; but we can also have some downside volatility. In addition to that, we’ve had a few very strong years in Oliver Wyman, setting up some pretty tough comparables for us. But in the third quarter, we will see a decline That comes primarily from our Financial Services business, which has grown even faster than Oliver Wyman overall. And beyond Financial Services, we’re feeling only a modest slowdown at this point across the portfolio, driven by the slower economic growth expectations, exacerbated a little bit by Brexit. We still see very little to suggest this is any structural weakness, and the business still feels very sound. So we’re expecting the dip to be short-term, although it may take a quarter or two to work out.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Scott. Julio, you want to talk a little bit about Brexit and what he’s seeing right now within Mercer. So
Julio Portalatin: Yes, sure. I mean, I think there is a lot of continued uncertainty, of course, around Brexit and the short-as well as long-term implications of such. In the early days, as you can imagine, there’s a significant amount of discussions that are taking place with our primary clients around things like workforce planning, what’s going to happen if migrant issues are resolved one way or the other, what potentially could happen in terms of the investment strategy going forward for pensions. And all of that we are actively involved in. Throughout those discussions you can imagine there’s a bit of a slowdown in terms of their discretionary spend until the path is clearer and until we have an opportunity to propose some strategy on how to go forward. But let me clarify that. Increased uncertainty and market volatility will likely create some opportunities for us and as clients are going to look for advice, of course, to manage in that uncertain world and through the issues. So in the longer term, we look to develop these solutions, to continue to meet these emerging needs. And as I said, examples would be the potential changes in the flow of capital investments as well as in regulations with regard to workforce, benefits, and pension coverage
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Julio. And next question please.
Michael Nannizzi: Thank you.
Operator: And we will go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan: Thank you. Good morning. Just one follow-up with Mark on the pension expenses. Given if interest rates stay at current levels, what’s the magnitude of the potential impact relative to 2015, the $125 million? And would you be able to fully offset that, like, as you did in 2015?
Dan Glaser: So Mark, you want to take that?
Mark McGivney: Yes, Kai. Just a couple things. First on the sensitivity: as we said in our 10-K, roughly 50 basis points of discount rate change will have a $35 million or so impact on earnings. The reason we included the comments on pension is just because it is so topical. We’ve gotten a lot of questions from investors, and it’s hard to pick up a newspaper without reading something about it, given the low interest rate environment. So we just wanted to share where – how we’re thinking about it right now and wanted to highlight what I just talked about, that we are less sensitive today to interest rate volatility than we were. If you go back a couple years ago, we closed our largest defined-benefit plan in the UK, we closed our Irish plan, and we made the changes that we talked about to our U.S. plans. So we have less sensitivity, so that’s a factor. And remember what really matters is the interest rate environment at the end of the year. So although we’ve seen a drop in rates here in the first half of the year, just in the U.S. in the last couple of weeks rates have come back a little bit. And asset values have actually come back off their post-Brexit lows. So how we’re looking at this, we’re at the very beginning of our planning process, and as I said a few minutes ago pension expense is just one element of an overall expense base that we manage very actively. We manage to deliver a great result. So given where we are in the year, we can see this coming, we can plan under a number of scenarios. And based on where we see things today, we expect we’ll be able to limit the impact of pension volatility on earnings just as we have for the last couple of years.
Dan Glaser: Anything else. Kai.
Kai Pan: Yes, another question for Julio probably on the Healthcare Exchange. Any update on that in terms of the clients’ interest as well as your product design, and heading into the renewal season at the end of the year?
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Kai. Julio, you want to just take that one?
Julio Portalatin: Yes. As I said, Kai, in past calls, employers continue to look for solutions for long-term health trend reduction, and our Exchange is certainly one of those that we discuss actively. We’re really focused on that and continue to be extending the platform beyond enrollment experience, so it’s a full-year platform for employees to consult with. As mentioned in recent past, we see a lot of interest and a lot of discussions, but I would say that we’re experiencing a softer conversion to sales than what we had originally anticipated for this selling season. We’ll see how it comes out completely at the end, but certainly a little bit slower than we expected.
Kai Pan: Thank you
Dan Glaser: And we’re going to have things on time. So next question please.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, good morning. I just – going back to the commentary on the U.S. and Canada organic growth, I was particularly interested just how the MMA book performed in the quarter. I know over the past couple quarters you guys highlighted it as performing better than the rest of your business. Was that still the case in the second quarter? And did you also, I guess, see a slowdown within the growth within MMA in the Q2 as well?
Dan Glaser: Okay. We’re not going to break out MMA in any kind of formal way. We have said in the past that our expectation was that it would grow faster than overall Marsh, and that we were comfortable that it was exceeding our expectations on that score. And it did so again in the second quarter.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, great. Then just in terms of the margins that you saw in both of the segments, I know pension was a benefit – was a hit last year and a little bit of a benefit this year. Is there a way that we should be thinking about the impact that pension had on the Q2 margins, just in terms of how we think of the level of margin improvement for the balance of the year in both of the segments? Or would you just say it didn’t have as much of an impact that we should really be backing that out?
Dan Glaser: I would look at it this way. That, one, just to reiterate, look over longer periods. So year-to-date and rolling four quarters are more accurate ways of looking at margin expansion. And even though we don’t unpack pension, it’s fair to say pension was a benefit. But we would have had significant margin expansion in both segments even without contemplating the pension credit that we had. So I would just look over longer periods as to where the likely run rate of expansion is.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you. Then one last quick one. I noticed the level of capital expenditures slowed down in both quarters of this year. Anything – any comments on that front?
Dan Glaser: I’ll hand off to Mark in a second, but projects can be lumpy as well. So from that standpoint, our capital expenditure over the last several years has been bounded in a $300 million to $400 million annual kind of spend; we’re probably still in that area. Some projects are complicated, and we always prioritize. The best projects are the ones that are done well, and so that creates a little bit of a gating mechanism which has an impact. But, Mark, do you have anything else to add?
Mark McGivney: Yes, the only thing I would add, Elyse, I wouldn’t read too much into the slow start this year. It’s more just timing of starting some big projects, mainly on the technology side. So we had $million of CapEx last year. We’ll probably be a little bit less than that; but I still expect up in the high $200 million, $300 million range for the year.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you very much.
Dan Glaser: Thanks Elyse. Next question please.
Operator: And we will go next to Dave Styblo with Jefferies
Dave Styblo: Good morning. Thanks for the questions and also appreciate the color on Brexit and the P&C market early on. Considering the conversation of MMA and so forth, you guys still obviously have a conservative balance sheet with debt-to-EBITDA; I think maybe it’s around 1.6 right now. And my sense is you’d like to maintain that just to be able to seize on opportunities as they arise. Can you give us maybe a little bit more color on – if you are seeing increased opportunities especially in light of the volatility in Brexit that might be surfacing now, that wouldn’t have been there, say, three, six months ago? Or is it still going to continue to be the string-of-pearls strategy that you’ve been executing in the past?
Dan Glaser: It’s a good question, although we certainly wouldn’t preannounce anything on a quarterly. Yes, but I don’t know if you would or not. But ultimately what you’re saying could very well happen. There could be opportunities in parts of the world based upon uncertainty, whether it’s caused by Brexit or other factors, Clearly macro factors have a role to play in M&A and in continuing M&A. It’s too early in looking at Brexit to see whether there’s truly any new opportunities that are going to result from Brexit. But suffice to say that your basic premise of we’re relatively comfortable at our level of leverage now, and that our level of leverage preserves the capability for us to capitalize on opportunities if they may appear sometime in the future, is accurate. We think we live in a pretty uncertain, volatile world. And in uncertain, volatile world and difficult conditions, they may be the best opportunities that you ever see. And we certainly want to preserve the ability to capitalize if they so appear. Next question, Dave.
Dave Styblo: Yes; so we’ll stay tuned on that. Just coming back to the U.S./Canada, I want to look forward a little bit more instead of what’s happened. The tougher comps that happened in the 2Q of last year for the nonrecurring, can you maybe speak to a little bit more of what happened in the second half of last year? If there’s any particularly tough comps that we should just be aware of as we think about the rest of the year. And then what might change in Canada? Or how tough is the drag in Canada right now in regards to the commodity situation? Is this a structurally tough area until things turn around? Or do you see some light at the end of the tunnel where things are starting to improve?
Dan Glaser: Peter, you want to take that?
Peter Zaffino: Yes. Again, we could – if we spoke about the U.S. and Canada Division, going into each of its components would take a lot of time and we don’t break them out. There’s a lot of businesses. We have an MGA, we have a technology business, we have Canada, we have the core of Marsh. There’s a lot of businesses in MMA that comprise of the Division. I’m not going to really comment too much on the next couple of quarters. Don’t think that we will be in the same situation that we are in the second quarter. Again, each one is different and the prior-year comparables are different. And each component of the U.S. and Canada Division has a bigger percentage of its participation depending on which quarter. So again, I just wouldn’t over-read into what happened in the second quarter as a trend or that you’re going to hear a similar story as we get to the back half of the year.
Dan Glaser: Thanks. Peter
Dave Styblo: Thanks.
Dan Glaser: Next question please. Thanks David.
Operator: And we will go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb: My questions have been answered. Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Jay. Next question please.
Operator: We will go next to Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse.
Ryan Tunis: Hey, thanks. I just had a quick one. Just as it applies to Brexit, was there anything evident in the organic growth results this quarter, I guess just in anticipation of that vote, either clients deferring decisions or accelerating them, that may have in some way contributed to organic growth in either segment?
Dan Glaser: Yes, I wouldn’t think so. Again, I don’t think we have that level of granularity to know what’s in a client’s mind. I do believe that it’s fair to say, Brexit or otherwise, that many of our clients believe that we are living in an age of risk and uncertainty, and that risk and uncertainty creates a dampening enthusiasm for projects and for investments. So that has had an impact over the last number of years, I think, on not only our growth levels but on GDP worldwide. But there was no negative or positive spike that we could actually see as a result of early-stage thoughts about Brexit
Ryan Tunis: Okay. Thanks for sneaking me in.
Dan Glaser: Okay, thanks. Next question, please And will go next to Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.
Charles Sebaski: Good morning. Thank you. Dan, you made an interesting comment in your prepared remarks that RIS margins are as high as they’ve been since 1988, a hard market year and high interest rates; and shows the operational efficiency gains made over that time. I’m curious looking forward on not a quarter, not a year, what are the biggest levers for you guys to achieve opportunity or efficiency gains in your business on par with that, outside of just a pricing environment?
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Charles. I’ll just say it’s always funny comparing ourselves back into time. We are such a different Company than what we were back in 1988 that I am loath to create those comparisons even though we write them into our script. I would say we’re better than at any time in our history. Because when I look back in 1988, if you look at total RIS it was $1.3 billion of revenue. So we are multiple times larger and more diverse geographically, line of business, quality, etc. So this is the new world. I don’t set margin targets. Peter doesn’t as well. We don’t believe in them. We believe that there’s something about the human brain that looks at a target as something to reach and then draw back from. So I would not put any hurdle out there as to what this business could do and how it could perform. I do know that I’m quite confident that the leading factor in how we will do over time is organic growth. And if we have good levels of organic growth, we will have good levels of margin expansion, period. If we don’t have that organic growth, then all of our annual and multiyear search for efficiency – obviously that never ends. We have found different ways of running this business through structure, delayering, through technology, through better levels of client connectivity to create more ability for us to service clients on an efficient basis. And that creates a margin benefit to us go-forward. But do you have any other question, Charles.
Charles Sebaski: That is it. Thank you very much.
Dan Glaser: Okay. I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: And we will go next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Josh Shanker: Yes, thank you for fitting me in at the end, everyone. I get a question a lot from investors that I don’t have a good answer for, and I don’t know how important it is to you; but the question is: What is the risk of disintermediation for the insurance brokerage industry over the long run? And how are you addressing it?
Dan Glaser: Yes, well, it’s a question that I’m used to. Because when I was joining the business in 1982, I was reading articles about brokerage disintermediation that had been written in 1978 and considering: Should I actually join an industry that looks like it’s going to go the way of the dodo bird? The reality is, in an increasingly complex world, the need for advice rises. These were once transactional businesses; now they are principally advisory businesses with transactional capability. Big, big difference. So I would say the broad level risk of disintermediation is quite low. That’s not saying that there’s not ways of creating distribution that we as a Company have to be very focused on, whether it’s digital, whether it’s online, whether it’s worksite. There’s different ways of getting to our client base, and we have to be very open to the idea. And clearly in some parts of segments I feel you’ll have multichannels, right? Whether you look at motor or homeowners or maybe even small commercial, you’ll end up having multichannels, which means brokers, there will be direct, there will be affinity. There will be many different avenues for clients to be satisfied. The key is: What’s the client experience, who provides the best level of comprehensive client experience? And a little bit less about what the capital behind it is. It’s more about experience. I would just end with the thought as well, because I recently took a trip to a country which was always very much a nonbroker market which is beginning to turn more and more to a brokered market. The reality is that more parts of the world have become brokered, because the terms and conditions and the pricing are better in markets in which brokers are active than in where brokers are not active. So I feel pretty comfortable that we’re positioned well, but not secure in our position in the market. We have to always find ways of doing things better or else, yes, we will get disintermediated – perhaps by another intermediary, but we always have to stay on our toes and do things better. I think that’s it, operator, where we can end the call, because I know we’re beyond our hour. I just want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. Specifically thank our clients for their support and the faith they put in us, and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving our clients. Thank you very much.
Operator: Again that does conclude today’s conference. We do thank everyone for your participation. Please have a great day.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-04-28 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Marsh & McLennan Companies conference call. Today's call is being recorded. First quarter 2016 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They're available on the company's Web site at www.mmc.com. Please note the remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC Web site. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Daniel Glaser: Thank you, Matt. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO, and our operating company CEOs – Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter, Julio Portalatin of Mercer, and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh of Investor Relations. Before we begin, I would like to highlight a recent addition to our management team. Earlier this month, John Doyle joined Marsh as President, reporting to Peter Zaffino. John is also a member of the Executive Committee of MMC. Many of you know John, a highly regarded insurance industry leader. Most recently, he was CEO of AIG's Commercial Insurance business worldwide. John's appointment illustrates our continuing commitment to retain and attract talented professionals to Marsh & McLennan. Before moving on to our results, I thought I would spend a few moments talking about Brexit. It is a timely issue with the upcoming June vote. We have a significant presence in the UK and in Europe. And London is important as a major global insurance center. As you would expect, we have considered the potential ramifications for MMC. As I have said previously, we are supportive of the EU and believe Britain's inclusion makes both Britain and the EU stronger economically, politically, and strategically. On a macro level, while difficult to predict what the ultimate effects might be, Brexit would likely create an environment of uncertainty and volatility for the UK and the entire EU. This could last for last several years with potentially significant economic and political outcomes. The EU would be a weaker institution without the UK, which is its second largest economy and third largest population. And Britain's exit from the EU could jeopardize London's position as a major financial center. From a business perspective, we think Brexit will provide opportunities as well as challenges for MMC. Frankly, there are too many variables to predict the revenue impact, positive or negative, at this time. The immediate impact to MMC will be increased FX volatility as our exposure to the pound is relatively high. That said, we think the impact of the significant weakening of the pound on MMC will be negligible. The RIS segment would have a positive impact, owing to its natural hedge of having some US dollar revenue on international placements in London, while the foreign-exchange effect on consulting would be negative. Brexit is just one of many issues the global economy has faced during the last six years. Our clients rely on us even more during uncertain times. And we've done well for many years in a variety of challenging market environments. We've seen volatility around oil prices and FX, declining interest rates, political instability, and lower P&C insurance pricing. Over that time, the MMC team has consistently delivered strong performance. Despite headwinds, we've grown underlying revenue in a range of of 3% to 5% annually for six years in a row and we expect to do so in 2016. Our vast geographic footprint allows us to weather regional growth pressures and provides us balance. While there is growth somewhere in the world, we'll be on the ground to find it and capture it. We're also in growth businesses as a trusted advisor helping our clients address the issues of the day relating to risk, strategy and people. Our greatest resource is our people. We generate ideas and solutions and can pivot for opportunities for growth anywhere across our businesses. Periods of stress also present opportunities. An important part of our strategy is to preserve flexibility to capitalize on market dislocations when they occur. We will continue to invest regardless of any near-term volatility. We believe in the long term and have built the firm to achieve sustained growth in earnings. We believe in balance between delivering strong financial performance today, while investing for our future. Now, let me turn to our results. I'm pleased with MMC's operating performance in the first quarter. We had a strong start to the year and results were consistent with our plan to generate strong EPS growth for 2016 with underlying revenue growth and margin expansion in both segments. MMC generated underlying revenue growth of 4% in the first quarter with growth across all four of our operating companies. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter that we've increased underlying revenue by at least 3%. We're pleased with our profitability in the quarter. You will remember that last year's first quarter results included a significant credit resulting from changes to our retiree medical benefit in the United States. If you normalize the impact from retirement expense, we produce double-digit EPS growth with margin expansion in both segments. Mark will walk you through the details. Looking at our Risk & Insurance Services segment, revenue was $1.9 billion with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income was $543 million. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.5 billion. Underlying growth was 2% with all major geographic regions contributing. In the US/Canada division, underlying revenue growth was 2%, led by continuing strong performance of Marsh & McLennan Agency, partially offset by weakness in Canada. The international division also expanded 2%. EMEA rose 1%. Asia-Pacific grew 3% and Latin America increased 6%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $374 million, an increase of 3% on an underlying basis. Strong new business growth in global specialties, primarily in marine and EMEA led the way. In the Consulting segment, revenue was $1.5 billion, up 6% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income was $238 million. Mercer's revenue was $1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 3%. On a geographic basis, the revenue increase was led by growth markets and North America. By line of business, health was the biggest driver of growth, contributing 6%. Investments was up 1%, which follows 13% growth in the first quarter of last year. Talent was up 1% and retirement was flat. Oliver Wyman had an excellent first quarter. Revenue was $439 million, reflecting exceptional underlying growth of 15% with all regions contributing. The increase was led by strong performance in the financial services practice. We expect Oliver Wyman's rate of growth to moderate over the balance of the year as comparisons to the prior year get more difficult. In summary, we're pleased with our first quarter results, which provide a good start to the year. For the full year 2016, we expect underlying revenue growth within the 3% to 5% range, meaningful margin expansion in both operating segments and strong EPS growth at a level approaching our long-term target of 13%, all this while continuing to return capital to shareholders through dividends and meaningful share repurchases. With that, let me turn it over to Mark.
Mark McGivney: Thank you, Dan. And good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered solid underlying revenue growth in each of our operating companies, while maintaining control of operating expense. GAAP EPS rose 3% to $0.91. And adjusted EPS increased slightly to $0.92. As Dan mentioned, I will walk you through the retirement related items that make our earnings comparisons to last year's first quarter challenging and give you more clarity around our underlying results. You will recall, in the first quarter of 2015, we recognized a non-recurring credit of $125 million as a result of changes to our US retiree medical plan. Late in 2015, we made additional retirement plan changes that essentially replaced this credit not only for 2016, but beyond. As discussed on our last two earnings calls, the most impactful of these changes was to divide our US defined benefit plan into two separate plans. As a result of these changes, coupled with the many other factors that go into the measurement of our annual pension expense, we expect the year-over-year decline in retirement expense for 2016 of approximately $30 million or $0.04 per share. Although retirement expense will decline for the full year, it increased in the first quarter of 2016 compared with a year ago because of the significant credit we recorded in last year's first quarter. The increase in retirement expense in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the first quarter of 2015 was roughly $0.10 per share. Eliminating this impact, in the first quarter of 2016, MMC produced double-digit growth in adjusted EPS, high-single-digit growth in adjusted operating income, and meaningful margin expansion in both segments. For the year, we expect to generate underlying revenue growth, increased operating margins in both segments, and strong growth in earnings per share, with improving growth in the second half of the year. Moving to investment income, we had a loss of $3 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $5 million from a year ago. As we said on our last call, going forward, we expect to generate only modest investment income compared with the $38 million we reported in 2015. This anticipated reduction for 2016 will likely offset the $0.04 benefit from lower retirement expense I mentioned earlier. It is worth reiterating that the full year benefit from lower retirement expense is essentially offset by investment income -- our reduced investment income. This means that the financial performance we are expecting for 2016 will continue to come from strong underlying operating performance. We reported last year that we expected foreign exchange to adversely affect EPS by approximately $0.07 in 2016, with the majority occurring in the first half of the year. As anticipated, the impact in the quarter was $0.03. However, the dollar has weakened over the past several weeks against many of our key currencies. Assuming exchange rates remain at their current level, which was a big assumption given FX volatility in recent periods, we now expect the impact from FX to be de minimis for the remainder of the year. Our tax rate fluctuates from quarter to quarter, reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years, changes in international and local tax rates and other discrete items. Our adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was 28.5% compared with 29.4% in last year's first quarter. Our rate in the quarter was slightly below the 29% we guided to for 2016 due to discrete items recorded in the period. Based on the current landscape, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% for the remainder of 2016. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $5 billion compared with $4.4 billion at year-end. In addition to the $350 million of senior notes we issued in March, total debt includes 250 million of commercial paper outstanding. As we discussed in the past, we utilized the commercial paper market throughout the year for short-term liquidity and greater cash management flexibility. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us flexibility with modest near-term repayment obligation. Our next scheduled debt maturity is a $250 million senior note due in April 27. In the first quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of our stock for $200 million. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $918 million, with approximately $190 million in the US. Uses of cash in the first quarter included outlays for our annual bonus awards, which have increased in each of the past seven years; $200 million for share repurchases; $161 million for dividends; and $121 million for acquisitions and investments. For the full year 2016, we plan to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital through dividends, share repurchases, and acquisition. We expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments, to reduce our share count, and increase our dividends per share by double-digit. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.
Daniel Glaser: Thanks, Mark. Matt, we're ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We’ll go first to Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb: Thanks and good morning. It would be helpful, Mark, for us if you could just give us what your view is of baseline 2015 adjusted EPS as there are a lot of moving parts last year, especially around the retirement plan?
Daniel Glaser: So, Mark, you want to take that?
Mark McGivney: Yeah. Sure, Jay. I think the best way to think about this is 2016 reflects a good baseline. It’s really the one-time nature of the credit we had in the first quarter of last year, which I said in my prepared remarks, if you look at year-over-year retirement expense, the impact was roughly $0.10 a share in the first quarter. But I think 2016 is a good baseline.
Jay Gelb: In terms of the outlook for close to the 13% EPS growth for 2016, I’m just trying to figure out what 2015 baseline was…?
Mark McGivney: Remember, when we talked about last year, we encouraged people to think about our full year results. So I think if you look at our results for the full year, our $3.05 last year is a good number for us for baseline for 2015.
Jay Gelb: That’s what I thought. Just wanted to make sure. My second question is on the share buybacks. The $2.3 billion of capital deployment in dividends, share buybacks, and acquisitions was the same, as you said, at the end of the year. The buyback pace is a little faster than I would’ve anticipated in the first quarter, so I just wanted to get a sense of whether $1 billion of share buybacks in 2016 is still a reasonable assumption?
Daniel Glaser: Jay, we’ve never outlined a number of $1 billion. We actually said a couple of times in previous calls that we expect the return of capital to shareholders to look more similar to 2014, which was a number of like $2.3 billion. And so, if you look at that, and you say, ‘well, dividends are going to be $650 million to $700 million,’ it leaves you about $1.6 billion, maybe $1.7 billion between acquisitions and share repurchase. Just to be clear, share repurchase for us is an important commitment, and our commitment is to reduce the share count each year. We actually favor organic investments in our business, our dividend strategy, and our acquisition strategy over share repurchase. But if we favor share repurchase over building cash on our balance sheet, and I think that’s the way to look at it.
Jay Gelb: I appreciate that. Then my final question, I’m certain my estimates are not as important, based on the actual results, the RIS margin for this quarter is a lot higher than I would’ve thought and Consultings margin was lower than I would’ve expected. Is there anything we should keep in mind on that mix of margin, especially relative to the year-over-year comparisons?
Daniel Glaser: No, I think when you look at – and I’ll hand over to Mark in a second because he can go through a little bit about what was in the first quarter of last year versus what’s not. In our view, both RIS and Consulting have been on a multi-year expansion of margin track, and that’s continuing. And the noise in terms of the big credit that we had in the first quarter of last year, what we said last year was that, it did not impact Consulting all that much, but it was really weighted toward RIS. And that maybe is one of the reasons why you were talking about your estimates a second ago. But, Mark, what would you say about that?
Mark McGivney: Just a couple of things. I would say the first quarter 2016 represents a fair baseline. And when you look back to last year, remember that the two headwinds we were dealing with – both a significant increase in pension expense and FX and the one-time credit, so – and I know it’s a little tough to compare year-over-year. If you think about what a good baseline is, I think our results this year are fair – a fair baseline.
Jay Gelb: Thanks very much.
Daniel Glaser: Okay, take care, Jay. Next question?
Operator: We’ll go to Quentin McMillan with KBW.
Quentin McMillan: Thanks very much, guys. I just wanted to touch on the strong growth that you had out of the US and Canada. You put up 10% growth overall. The 2% organic was maybe just a touch below what I would’ve expected, but the 9% M&A growth, can you talk about where the growth – how the growth is working for Marsh & McLennan Agency, maybe where Marsh & McLennan Agency’s overall revenue base is currently, and any expectations that you sort of have for that business and related to the M&A growth?
Daniel Glaser: So, basically, I’ll start it off and then I’ll hand over to Peter to talk a little bit about MMA and MMA strategy. And, first of all, we’ve always been a company that is built upon underlying growth and growing our existing businesses on a same office, same line of business basis and making sure that we never become reliant on acquisitions for growth. Having said that, we have an acquisition strategy. And over the last couple of years, we have acquired more firms and committed to more capital to acquisitions because of the opportunities that we saw. None bigger than Marsh & McLennan Agency. But, Peter, you want to talk about where MMA is currently?
Peter Zaffino: Sure. Thank you, Dan. The answer is going to be very similar to some of my commentary in some of the prior quarters. The premise behind MMA has been that the middle market in the United States provides an opportunity for higher growth in the large accounts base, and that has largely proven to be true. We think it’s a very good segment. We’ve acquired the highest quality agencies, just adding Celedinas in the first quarter which is a high net worth personal lines agency, best-in-class, out of Palm Beach. We’ve shared best practices. We’ve been heavily investing in sales capacity. And we have a very balanced business between employee health and benefits and property and casualty. So we’re very pleased with the acquisitions that we’ve made. Strong organic growth. And I think the last part of your question was just roughly what the size is. And we think, by year-end, with no more acquisitions, if we weren’t to do any – we do have a very strong pipeline – but as of today, the annualized revenue is approximately $950 million.
Quentin McMillan: Thanks very much. And then secondly, just a slightly bigger picture question, a couple of the underwriters have talked about a little bit of a back-and-forth with the brokers in terms of commission percentage and what’s going on with the weaker rate environment. Can you guys just comment in terms of what you’re seeing in working with your underwriter partners and the give-and-take between what your commission rates have been and where that stands now?
Daniel Glaser: I guess that’s confirmation that prices – or at least waiting levels are under pressure when you get some of the tit-for-tat between the brokerage community and the underwriting community. The people around this stable have been on both sides of that aisle and have been involved in the market for a long time. So we’ve seen many cycles. And so, I would say right of the back, this, to me, doesn’t strike us as unusual in any way. The market itself, over the last 30 years, has almost always been highly competitive with bouts of reactionary, episodic tightening. But, in general terms, it’s usually always very competitive. And so, we have built our business around the capability of operating in highly competitive insurance market cycles, not around operating when the market is tightening. I can’t really explain to you in depth. I’ll leave it up to them as to why underwriters write more new business when rates are declining than when rates are rising or why they are willing to provide higher levels of retail commissions when rates are reducing versus when rates are rising. I’ll leave that over to them to talk through. But we are operating in our strategy. We don’t think anything untoward. Our relationships with our carrier partners are very close, perhaps closer than at any time in my career. We work on a lot of strategic projects together, showing how we can build our business and grow the pie to the mutual benefit of our clients. Do you have any other questions?
Quentin McMillan: No, that’s great. Thanks very much, guys. And congrats on the quarter.
Daniel Glaser: Okay, next question please.
Operator: We’ll go to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi: Thanks. Just to pick up on that a little bit on the MMC Agency side, what is organic growth – the organic and inorganic growth look like as far as that subset, MMC Agency? Is that something you could just give us some indication of what that’s tracking right now?
Daniel Glaser: No, I don’t think we’re going to break out the Agency as a subset. We haven’t done that before. And I know if we do it once, we’ll do it forevermore. So I think we’re going to keep that to ourselves. I would say what to refer to is the strategy that we laid out all the way back in late 2009. Our basic premise was, we believe we could create the highest quality agency in the United States and end up with a SMEs and middle market and upper middle market company which was well balanced between property and casualty, employee benefits, and personal lines, and that that would grow faster organically than overall Marsh at a similar or higher level of EBITDA margin. And that strategy is holding. But we’re not going to break out the subset.
Michael Nannizzi: Got it. I guess it’s getting close to Guy Carpenter size. Does there comes a point in terms of just thinking about standalone, where you’ll consider that or it is what it is?
Daniel Glaser: We are currently in the it-is-what-it-is phase of development of MMA. But it still has a tremendous amount of runway. And I imagine, at some point in time, we will consider whether that should be broken out and shown separately. But it certainly won’t be anytime in the near future.
Michael Nannizzi: Got it, okay. And then, just quickly on the Consulting side, with Oliver Wyman growing as fast as it has, with all due respect, you guys have been talking about slowing growth there for a long time. It just keeps going. How should we think about the margin impact in Consulting if Oliver Wyman continues to run ahead of the rest of the business from a growth perspective? Was that a net headwind or a tailwind for margins of that segment if that continues to happen?
Daniel Glaser: Couple of things. I think it’s important for us to have an overall view of the Consulting segment. One, you have to just start with looking at the size of Mercer relative to the size of Oliver Wyman and recognize that if Mercer isn’t generating margin improvement, it would be very hard for the segment to show margin improvement regardless of where the top line is for Oliver Wyman at any point in time. Clearly, we are pleased with Oliver Wyman’s revenue performance over the past two years. But I would just caution everybody that the vast majority of Oliver Wyman’s revenue is non-recurring project work. And so, new projects have to be added continuously for us to even maintain levels of revenue, let alone grow it. So we know, as a leadership team, that Oliver Wyman will have a more – higher level of volatility on the top line than any of the other three opcos. And that is one of the reasons why we have built a model where Oliver Wyman’s compensation model is very performance-sensitive. So their expense base naturally – their expense base, which is largely compensation and benefit, naturally flexes with their revenue line, and so – up or down, Oliver Wyman has much more of a revenue impact on MMC than an earnings impact.
Michael Nannizzi: Perfect. Thanks so much.
Daniel Glaser: Okay. Next question please.
Operator: We’ll move next to Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, good morning. I was hoping to spend a little bit more time on Guy Carpenter. The growth was stronger than you saw within Marsh in the quarter. I know that’s an area that you guys have been making some new hires. Are you going to just talk about the new business and the growth that you are seeing there, as well as just provide an outlook on based on the current market conditions for the balance of the year?
Daniel Glaser: Sure. Alex?
Alexander Moczarski: Okay. We’re very pleased with the 3% underlying growth. That’s probably stronger than we had expected and we had strong new business and the pipeline remains good. Tailwinds, we’ve been facing for the last five years, but we still achieved organic growth in 27 of the last 29 quarters. So we are a sort of forward-leaning company and we know how to grow it. New business was very good in the specialties area, in EMEA. The other regions were strong, particularly on the retention side. The new hires that we brought in have had some effect so far, but actually we’re expecting to see more of that effect coming through the following months, particularly as we increase our participation with the larger companies, with a very nicely balanced organization, and we think that we’ll be able to continue with moderate growth for the rest of the year.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, thanks. And then just a little bit on the growth within Marsh, I know you mentioned strong growth still within MMA, but, overall, Marsh did slow a little bit in the Q1. How do you think about the next three quarters of the year? Any growth trends that might cause you to change that outlook or you might think that the number might come in a little bit higher during the back half of the year?
Daniel Glaser: Peter?
Peter Zaffino: Thanks, Elyse. In a business the size of Marsh, there’s always a lot going on. As you said, the 2% underlying growth, if you compare it to the fourth quarter, I would encourage just to take a look at the full year. The first quarter 2016 does represent the 24th consecutive quarter of underlying revenue growth. So I’m very proud of Marsh that we’ve been able to build an organization that can generate organic growth in the short, medium and long-term. As Dan mentioned and I reiterated, we have very strong performance in MMA, but we also had solid growth across our emerging markets and very good growth in employee health and benefits. Having said that, there were few things that tempered growth in the quarter. The first quarter is highly dependent on the mature markets within Marsh, particularly Continental Europe, which renews about half of its book in the first quarter. And we have a terrific business in Continental Europe. But just based on the macros and insurance conditions, it has historically grown in the low-single-digits and that’s what happened in this quarter as well. We are facing some headwinds in the insurance market. We know there is an abundance of capacity. We’ve had a little bit of pricing pressure in the quarter. It did temper, but it is – it’s been happening for the better part of the last few years. And we continue to weather the slowdown in some of the commodity-based economies like Australia, Canada, Brazil. Great businesses, but just a little bit of tempered on the growth. So if I step back and take a broader view, I’m really pleased with the key fundamentals, meaning the clients that we’re retaining, strong new business, continue to expand into new products, had a terrific progress we’ve made on cyber. We’re about up 80% year-over-year on brokerage and in premium and expect to see a very strong trend continue. And our investments are highly driven by delivering superior value to clients and I feel really good where we are.
Daniel Glaser: Thanks, Peter. Elyse, anything is?
Elyse Greenspan: Just one quick question, in terms of – you guys did mention on the leverage increase modestly, building up in the first quarter. How do you think about your leverage ratio for the balance of the year and just in terms of how that might impact your capital return? Thank you.
Daniel Glaser: I think the way to look at it is is that the leverage ratio will move around a little bit with EBITDA and with the timing of when we raise debt and that sort of thing. But we ended last year at about 1.6. And whether we were at 1.5 or 1.8, we’re in a range of debt-to-equity type of – debt-to-EBITDA type of leverage. I would say we’ll just remain in that range for the foreseeable future.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you.
Daniel Glaser: Next question please.
Operator: We’ll go to Larry Greenberg with Janney.
Larry Greenberg: Good morning and thank you. Just going to try one more on M&A. So the contribution in the quarter for Marsh was higher than it’s been in a long time. I’m just wondering, given the transactions that you’ve done to-date, is that a reasonable run rate contribution for the next quarter too?
Daniel Glaser: I think I’ll start with that. But I would say it really depends on the timing of when the larger acquisitions come in. I don’t have the schedule right in front of me, but my guess is that that kind of run rate only lasts for a short period of time until we start laughing when we pull in other acquisitions from previous years. And so, from that standpoint, it’s dependent in large part as to whether we do anything in the short term now either in terms of what kind of acquisitions we put on. But, basically, when we look at acquisitions’ overall impact on revenue, it’s been between 2% and 3% over the last several years. And I think that’s probably, as a total company, a better way of looking at what acquisitions are doing to our revenues, 2% to 3%.
Larry Greenberg: Okay. And then, Mark, I know you said FX de minimis over the balance of the year, but will we still see a negative impact in the second quarter and then maybe that offset over the second half?
Daniel Glaser: Mark, do you want to take that?
Mark McGivney: I think, Larry, and as I said in my prepared remarks, this change – and I just want to emphasize that the outlook that we’ve given is based on rates – spot rates this week. We’re at the point where the euro is now up 5% from where it was a year ago, the yen is up 9%, and the Aussie dollar is flat. But if we had gone back a month ago, the guidance would have been different. So just take it all with a grain of salt. But that de minimis comment would carry for the next three quarters, so second quarter as well.
Larry Greenberg: Thanks.
Daniel Glaser: Next question please.
Operator: We’ll move to Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan: Thank you and good morning. So first question for Mark. And thank you for the detail about the EPS impact year-over-year. I just want to drill down to the margin impact because looks like, by my calculation, if you take out $125 million margin benefit in the first quarter 2015, so the year-over-year margin actually improved about 170 basis points. I just want to confirm that. And also, if that’s the case, so it’s very strong compared with the margin expansion for the past few quarters. So I just wonder, given the current 3% to 5% organic growth, you can still deliver that strong margin expansion going forward.
Daniel Glaser: Yeah, Mark, you want to take that?
Mark McGivney: As I’ve said in my prepared remarks, the net impact is about $0.10. If you do the math, it’s roughly $75 million. So, remember, the $125 million one-time in the first quarter of last year, so pension expense is also down this year somewhat as well. So you really have to take out both pieces. So we did say we had – when you make this adjustment, meaningful margin expansion overall and in both segments. But I think if you use $75 million, not the $125 million, you get closer to the right ZIP code.
Kai Pan: Okay. And then the larger picture question is that a lot of carriers talking about market disruption from both M&A as well as some reorganizations. I just wondered, from a brokers’ perspective, where do you see opportunities?
Daniel Glaser: So I’ll take that broadly and then I’ll other hand over to Peter to talk a little bit more about the impact of re-underwriting and acquisitions and consolidation. Generally, when we look at it, I think we said it in a couple of calls ago, with all the consolidation, there’s actually more insurance companies in our space in the United States than there were 10 or 15 years ago. And so, it’s still a very fragmented, competitive marketplace. And we see very little – there used to be – when I look earlier in my career, say, 25 years ago or so, there was this huge qualitative difference between the larger carriers and midsize carriers. Because the midsize carriers, in large part, are staffed in leadership teams with people who came from the larger carriers, that qualitative distance between the two doesn’t play out quite as readily. And so, there’s ample companies for us to talk to and have meaningful relationships with and discussions with our clients with in a tripartite way. We have really core relationships. If anything, this level of refocus from some of the larger carriers has created a deeper closeness between the working teams at Marsh and their counterparts in the underwriting companies to make sure that – we want our clients to be with people who want to write that account. And so, we want to make sure we know clearly what the underwriting appetite is and what the commitment to the future is. And so, therefore, there’s been a lot of dialogue and a lot of interaction at a strategic level. So we feel pretty good about where we are. But, Peter, you want to add to that?
Peter Zaffino: Yes. I don’t think there’s much to add, Dan. I think you covered most of the key points. We want to make sure that we are focusing on providing the best advice to our clients, with all the changing dynamics that are happening in the industry. While there’s been a decent amount of changes, perhaps through acquisitions and some of the leadership changes, by and large, across the world, the risk appetites have not changed that much. We are trying to find ways in which we can create more product, whether it’s in cyber or in terrorism or making sure that we simplify the insurance product. And so, I would add, as Dan said, we have such a close relationship with so many of the insurance companies and trading partners that we’re always trying to improve the experience for our clients and making sure that we are anticipating the changes that are happening around the corner and not just being stagnant in today’s market. But by and large, we don’t see anything that is a major dislocation for clients and I think it’s – we will continue to trade as we have in the past.
Kai Pan: Thank you.
Daniel Glaser: Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: We’ll go to Sarah DeWitt with JP Morgan.
Sarah DeWitt: Hi, good morning. On the brokerage organic growth of 2%, is that a level where you think you can expand margins over the long-term?
Daniel Glaser: Peter, you want to take that? And why don’t you talk about a little bit more broadly because we don’t do margins for individual opcos? But if you just look at that kind of level in RIS overall, what would your comments be?
Peter Zaffino: The 2% long-term growth, it’s hard to make significant investments as well as expand margin. But we’ve been making a lot of investments over the past five to seven years. And we are in a place where if we had 2% over the short, medium term, I think there are opportunities to expand margin because we built in a lot of efficiencies within Marsh. An example would be, in the United States, something called a Qualified Solutions Group. It’s an investment we made three or four years ago to streamline the process of placement, working with insurance companies to get more contract certainty, using technology to make it more efficient for our client experience, and just getting a better product with some of our largest trading partners. That is something that, I think, will yield deficiencies and opportunities for margin expansion through top line growth and lower expense. So we’ve made a lot of investments over time. But if you’re in a multi-year 2%, it is hard to expand margins. But don’t think that’s the world we are in.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay.
Daniel Glaser: Any other questions, Sarah?
Sarah DeWitt: And just to clarify, the 3% to 5% organic growth this year, is that for each segment or just the company overall?
Daniel Glaser: No, that’s when we look at the company overall.
Sarah DeWitt: Could brokerage, risk and insurance services be in that range as well?
Daniel Glaser: It’s hard to tell. Certainly, our expectation is not that we have any kind of long period where brokerage is operating below 3% organic growth. But there could be periodic periods where that happens and we’ll manage the business accordingly. If I look at my brokerage segment and you effect for the pension credits we were talking about before and eliminate those from last year and this year in terms of the way you look at the business, both segments increased their margins. So RIS increased their margins in the first quarter despite the level of growth. And so, I’m pretty comfortable we could manage the business. But we’ve said several times in the past, as a company, we believe we drive for margin when the company grows at 3% or better. And if the company grows less than that, our margins may improve because of the efficiency gains et cetera. But our view is, generally, we are more comfortable growing margins when our organic growth is 3% or better.
Sarah DeWitt: Great. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Daniel Glaser: Thanks. Next question please.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to Dave Styblo with Jefferies.
Dave Styblo: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. First one was, just a little bit on the competitive landscape, and one of your peers earlier reported about retention levels that just weren’t as high as they had wanted. Curious to hear or see, are you guys continuing to track along what you’d expect for your given market share, your pro rata growth of the end market or has this been a period where you’ve maybe been able to pick up a few lives – excuse me, some additional membership to – from the employer base to help offset the pressures that we’re talking about in Continental Europe and so forth?
Daniel Glaser: Yeah, I would say, overall, throughout, whether you’re looking at Consulting or RIS, our account and revenue retentions are very consistent with where they’ve been in the past. And so, there has been no impact. We absolutely do believe in each of our segments that there is a potential future benefit from flight to quality in times of uncertainty and volatility, which we would pick up in the future. But, today, it’s very competitive. We’ve been maintaining our positions on accounts and our client level of retention and revenue retention on those clients is very consistent with how it’s been over the last several years.
Dave Styblo: Very good, okay. If I could drill into the margins a little bit more, starting in RIS, so I know in the first quarter of 2015, I think you guys talked about a normalized margin of 27.6%. So off that, we’re up 150 basis points, so maybe some of the pension changes here helped that a little bit. But can you bridge us to the increase, especially in light of the organic growth being maybe at the lower end of your range? I know, obviously, you’ve made these investments you’ve talked about over the last five to seven years, maybe that’s paying dividends. But was there any sort of one-off activity that helped margins or what is driving that margin increase?
Daniel Glaser: I’ll just repeat some of the things that I’ve said earlier in previous years. Margins are important, obviously, and they are part of how we drive to get to our long-term CAGR of 13% on EPS. But when we run our business and we create our own strategies, margins are one of the financial metrics that we care about least. We look at organic growth. We look at operating income and earnings growth and we look about the air between our revenue growth and our expense growth. And so, margins are a natural outcome of us managing the business properly, right? So that is the fundamental strategic view. I can tell you, I really don’t give a hoot about margins in any one quarter. We run our business in a way of, how did we do over the course of year – one year and multiyear basis. Our margins have been on a track. We’ve been talking about margins with the investment community for a lot of years now. And I just have to say that 2016 is going to be the ninth consecutive year of margin expansion and the seventh consecutive year of margin expansion in both segments. And so, our margins are going to go up as an outcome of the way we run the business. But in terms of the inside baseball of margin in one quarter versus margin in another quarter is not meaningful to us.
Dave Styblo: Fair enough. Fair enough. Thanks.
Daniel Glaser: Okay, thank you. Next question please.
Operator: We’ll go to Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse.
Ryan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Hate to follow this up with another question on margins, but just curious, thinking about the currency, that’s clearly been a headwind for so long. How should we think about that? Is that – does it flip to a tailwind? What’s been the headwind for margins, if any, and what type of positive impact could that have if the dollar is no longer a headwind?
Daniel Glaser: If you look over the past several years, we’ve talked, for example, how constant currency last year, we would have produced something like 14% or 14.5% EPS growth rather than the 8% or 8.2% or so that we posted. So, clearly, it’s been a headwind for, like, five years. I should say, over a 20-year period, it’s been a wash. But in shorter periods, it, obviously, has an impact. If we get a tailwind on FX, boy, will we be happy? And it would translate into easier ability to make our typical long-term 13% CAGR on EPS. And so, we view that as an absolute positive development if it happens. But I’m not sure if there is anything more I can say on that. Mark, do you have anything?
Mark McGivney: 2015 was such an unusual year for FX. But, generally, FX has kind of gone plus and minus in a range and it has generally a modest impact on margins that we really haven’t talked about. And the impact even in the early part of this year has been relatively modest. So we really don’t think about it all that deeply in a normal year.
Ryan Tunis: Okay. So modest impact on margins. And then, I guess, just shifting gears over to Mercer. And, I guess, looking at the organic growth in investments and just trying to parse through how much of that is just difficult comps, the new business environment, or to the extent to which the macro environment or just the investing environment in general could drive what organic growth could end up being for 2016?
Daniel Glaser: Ryan, I want to give you a pat on the back because I was worried about Julio napping at the end of the table. So, Julio, you want to take that?
Julio Portalatin: Yeah, Ryan. Thanks for waking me up. Very appreciated. Let me see if I can do a little level-setting and then I’ll get into the investments business. The Mercer portfolio, as you know, is a pretty diversified and balanced portfolio, whether you speak of it in terms of geography or line of business or any kind of portfolio or client segment. And as you can imagine, there can be puts and takes across a portfolio in any one quarter. But we have consistently now delivered growth for several quarters in a row. More importantly, we are well-positioned to continue to produce short, medium and long-term profitable growth. As you’ve heard me speak about before, we’re very disciplined in disinvesting in areas where we cannot achieve that profitable growth and investing in areas that we can on a consistent basis. A good example of that is the way we repositioned the portfolio around growth strategies; investments being one of them; health exchanges; workday implementation, you’ve seen us invest there; Alexander Forbes, improving our geographic footprint; while disinvesting, for example, in the recent decision be made on DC admin recordkeeping business. So we continue to do that as a dynamic and discipline in the organization that’s now built into our culture. As it relates to the investments business, I think you already mentioned that we had a tough comparison in the quarter to the first quarter 2015, in which we had exceptional growth of 13%. I must tell you, though, that overall, though, investment pipeline is strong. It’s looking good. There will be some, again, gyrations because of external environment on occasion. But the investments we’ve made and the kind of client organic growth that we are experiencing continues to give us great confidence that they will contribute to profitable growth.
Ryan Tunis: Okay. And then I just had one really quick one for Mark. Just thinking about the pensions stuff, I don’t want to call it the offset, but the lower pension expense this year, is that more disproportionately located in Risk Services versus Consulting? Thanks.
Daniel Glaser: Mark, do you want to take that?
Mark McGivney: No, I would think about it sort of distributed – there are many ways to get at it. But, no, it is something – our employee populations participate across our operating companies in our plan. So I think you can think about it, if you use revenue as a base or employees as a base or comp and benefits, I think you’ll be fine. But it affects the whole company.
Daniel Glaser: Next question please.
Operator: We’ll go next to Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.
Charles Sebaski: Good morning. Thank you for getting me in. I know there’s been a lot of talk about margins and I don’t want to talk about them from the basis of this quarter or quarter-over-quarter. But I’d appreciate you guys’ thought on a multi-year basis. What can the business get assuming you keep your 3% organic growth, right? There’s margin. Is there an upward bound, I guess, is what I’m thinking? If you think about – if I think of the RIS business, it was 22.5% operating margin last year. Can this be a 26% or 27% business in the future? Is there headwinds where you get – a point where you reach where it’s – that’s as far as it goes at the compensation levels or other parts that there is just some natural impediment? Where is the upward bound in a normal operating environment for the business?
Daniel Glaser: Yeah. There’s a couple of things. One, you’ll know that I don’t actually like creating target numbers on things like margin because I think targets have a way of people trying to get there or touch it as being, ‘okay, target achieved,’ and then you see it shrink back again. At the end of the day, I do not want to create boundaries on how either of our segments could perform in the future. We have all kinds of advantages in terms of efficiency, technology, expense synergies, revenue synergies that we’re capturing within the company. So comparisons to how the company operated in a decade or 15 years ago are not really that relevant for us. So I keep it very open in terms of – what I do say and what I know Peter and Julio and Alex and Scott say when we’re talking to our teams is do not drive for margin at the expense of investing for the business or for organic growth. And so, from that perspective, I just think it’s important for you to know the way we look at it. Having said all of that, we’ve been talking about margins essentially for the last eight years. And the story for us has been pretty consistent. We expect to be able to grow margins because we run our business in a way that expenses almost always grow at a slower pace than revenue. We expect to continue to do that. Clearly, that level of difference varies based upon when our margins get up to, let’s say, very high levels sometime into the future. Then we’ll be very happy to grow expenses at the same pace as revenue because we would have such a fantastic business. We already have market-leading margins relative to the mega brokers, and so we feel pretty good about where they are. And I’ll just remind everybody that when we look at margins and talk about it, we look on a multiyear basis. As I look over the last four or five years, both segments have grown margins between 400 and 500 basis points. And so, I could’ve easily set a target or some sort of threshold number four of five years ago because I remember conversations where people would say, ‘well, do you think you can grow your margins 200 to 250 basis points from where they are today?’ And, boy, am I glad that we didn’t say yes to that and create some sort of hurdle to where we’ve now felt we’ve achieved it, so now we won’t grow them anymore. We’re just going to let the businesses run and see where that takes us. But we’re quite confident that 2016 will be the seventh consecutive year that you see expansion in both segments.
Charles Sebaski: Okay. And I guess into the business and I think one of the things that might be helping that, I’d be interested in any kind of color on the Marsh ClearSight, on the data and analytics. I guess I’m curious, at this point, how prevalent that is within the book of business, if you could give any kind of example on how that might be helping to lead organic growth or just improving the business or retention as that part of the business seems to be gaining importance and recognition?
Daniel Glaser: Yeah. I’ll just start by saying data analytics as a way for us to capture value from the scale advantages that we have in both of our segments is an important part of our future. And so, there is a significant amount of activity in each operating company in these fields of data analytics. ClearSight specifically is a unit within Marsh and, obviously, it has a focus on data and analytics, but Marsh’s focus goes far beyond ClearSight. But, Peter, you want to add to that?
Peter Zaffino: Yeah. We’ve started this journey many years ago in terms of trying to harness and capture the rich amount of data that exist within Marsh to the benefit of our clients. We have expanded our analytics platforms to be able to give our clients much more insight in terms of volatility, any catastrophe exposure, predictive modeling and really tying it all together. One great example of that is, as we rolled out an IMAP technology – and we think it’s the industry’s only mobile real-time analytics platform – that allows our clients to have interactive discussions with us based on market conditions, based on overlaying a rich database to show them benchmarking and peer reviews and we do measure RFP statistics where we have a full comprehensive analytics approach versus a more traditional, and our win ratio is significantly higher. And I think we will continue to make investments on the data analytics side. We have a significant amount of claims data and want to be very focused on the SME segment as well in terms of providing insight.
Charles Sebaski: Okay, thank you.
Daniel Glaser: No, go ahead, Charles.
Charles Sebaski: I was just wondering, is that data and analytics pushing down into MMA as well or is that product and service only within the more traditional Marsh side?
Peter Zaffino: It is pushing into MMA as well. There is just a different value proposition for middle market clients than there is for large clients. So the actual delivery of that is a bit different. But, yes, it is going into the mid-market and providing insight.
Daniel Glaser: Charles, and to other people on the call as well, I just want to make the point that data analytics and innovation in general is really across the piece. And there’s a lot of activity within RIS, but there’s certainly a lot of activity within Mercer and Oliver Wyman as well. Julio, you have a couple of things to say about that?
Julio Portalatin: Yeah. We’ve been, of course, focusing on being able to understand more about behaviors of our clients and being able to apply it to some of our solutions. Health would be a very good example of that. As we continue to build, as an example, Mercer Marketplace, we’re building our own database that we can be able to continue to look at and analyze and be able to make solutions tied to the relevant outcomes of that data analysis. And so, we have a lot of work going on around that. The rest of our health portfolio, same thing. We’ve also introduced all sorts of different ways to be able to attract the demands that are necessary to be served for clients. For example, Mercer Match is a new innovation that we put together that’s based on collecting neuroscience data and also matching it with gamification, so that assessment of potential pools of candidates could be made much more easily with higher outcomes, positive outcomes for our clients. In addition to that, another example would be Harmonise which we have launched in the UK, which is database-driven analytics that allows us to, in one-fell-swoop tool, deliver push information for individual employees to make decisions about – informed decisions about their benefit choices. And that’s now been launched in the UK and also in Ireland. So the data is a very strong foundational base that is driving our innovations and our future solutions matching to our clients’ needs.
Daniel Glaser: I think we have time for one more question, Operator.
Operator: We’ll go to Vinay Misquith with Sterne Agee.
Vinay Misquith: Hi. Can we just stick with one question? Given the 2% organic growth in the brokerage operations, if you could just help me understand the puts and takes on two fronts. Number one, the economy and – the stabilizing economy and how it has had an impact on organic growth? And, two, pricing, because, historically, we've seen when pricing was weak in the industry, the economy has been much stronger. Thank you.
Daniel Glaser: I’d just say a couple of things and then, hopefully, I’ll leave a little room for Peter. But just, overall, let’s not get too technical here, it’s one quarter. And if you look at the economic impact of one quarter, there’s usually a significant lag factor between what GDP is doing and what’s happening in the insurance arena. Peter, you want to talk a little bit about, let’s say, exposure units versus rates and where we end up on that, whether it’s positive or negative?
Peter Zaffino: Yeah. Dan, thank you. And we didn’t talk a lot about pricing. But we did see pricing temper both sequentially and year-over-year in the quarter. So international business has a little bit more rate decrease when compared to the US and Canada. Property still leads the rate decreases, although it is tempering. And we have seen modest increases in exposure in total insured values, sales and payroll. And we’ve also had a number of yield initiatives across the world. So when we aggregate everything, it really does amount to a modest headwind.
Daniel Glaser: Is that okay, Vinay?
Vinay Misquith: Yes, thank you.
Daniel Glaser: Okay, thanks a lot. And I’d like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. Even though he did not get a question, I’d like to thank Scott and the Oliver Wyman team for growing 15% in the first quarter. So thank you very much. I’d like to thank our shareholders for their investment in our company, our clients for their support, and our colleagues for their dedication. A core priority for us is to foster a culture of integrity, accountability and performance in everything we do. We are proud of the progress we have made and we’re excited about the path before us. Have a good day.
Operator: That does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation.

I'll now turn the call over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Shelan, and good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. I'm very pleased to welcome our new CFO, Mark McGivney. In addition to having a very strong operational background, Mark becomes the first MMC Chief Financial Officer to have served both Marsh and Mercer as CFO. Welcome, Mark. Joining me on the call today are the operating company CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter, Julio Portalatin of Mercer, and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh of Investor Relations. It is difficult to accurately predict where the world is headed. I recently return from Davos, where ongoing global market volatility was a major point of discussion. Our clients need advice now more than ever to navigate these uncertain times. For Marsh & McLennan, opportunities are abundant to help our clients face the challenges of the day, many of which revolve around risk, strategy and people. These challenges are highlighted in the Annual Global Risk Report produced by the World Economic Forum with the help of Marsh & McLennan Companies. This Report explores the mounting and interconnected risks faced by corporations of all sizes as well as government entities and individuals. Over the last several years, the dialogue has evolved from mainly economic risks to include geopolitical, societal and environmental concerns. We certainly live in an age of risk. According to the UN, 2015 was characterized by social and political instability, as some 60 million people were forcibly displaced, the largest number in history. Geopolitical tensions are also escalating between global and regional powers in places like Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Ukraine, Korea and the South China Sea. Market dislocations in China and drastic reductions in commodity prices have raised concerns about global growth and dented business confidence. And financial markets are skeptical about the effectiveness of central banks given the limited tools at their disposal in a near zero interest rate environment. Amidst this global uncertainty, it is easy for companies to embrace self-fulfilling pessimism. While we remain cautious on the global front, we see several factors that are positive for Marsh & McLennan Companies. The developed world continues to post modest but steady GDP growth and improving employment rates. And the emerging markets, while volatile, are a long-term driver of growth. The demand for our services remains strong. We are optimistic about our prospects for continued organic growth and our acquisition pipeline is in good shape. Our fundamentals are rock solid. We are stronger strategically, operationally and financially than at any time in the past decade. We have a deep understanding of our clients and the markets in which we operate. We set challenging yet realistic objectives for our performance and we deliver on our commitments. So let's review our performance in 2015. We capped off the year with an outstanding fourth quarter, posting our highest underlying revenue growth of 2015 at 5%. This was our 11th consecutive quarter of at least 3% underlying revenue growth. We also delivered 8% adjusted EPS growth, driven by higher operating income with margin expansion in both the RIS and consulting segments. In terms of our full-year performance, MMC produced underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both segments and meaningful EPS growth. Underlying revenue grew 4%, representing our sixth consecutive year in the 3% to 5% growth range. This was also our sixth consecutive year of margin expansion in both the RIS and consulting segments. This expansion was balanced across the segments, with Risk and Insurance Services rising 90 basis points to 23.3% and Consulting up 80 basis points to 17.3%. On a consolidated basis, the margin rose 100 basis points to 19.1%, our highest level in 12 years. Adjusted EPS increased 8% to a record $3.05, while absorbing $0.18 of negative FX impact. Since 2009, our adjusted EPS has grown at a CAGR of 13.5%, consistent with the 13% long-term target we set at Investor Day in 2010 and reaffirmed at Investor Day in March 2014. This was accomplished despite approximately $200 million of FX headwinds during this six-year period, a yearly average of $0.04 per share. Before I discuss our view regarding 2016, I would like to spend a few moments on recent developments in the insurance industry. There is a noticeable amount of change occurring at many insurance companies. We have seen large-scale M&A, senior management changes, a reduction in the underwriting appetite at several companies, as well as a willingness at some firms to reconsider reinsurance as a way to reduce volatility. These developments are not overly concerning to us or our clients, since the changes do not relate to issues of financial strength or solvency. In fact, there are potential positive outcomes for MMC, such as volatile markets could result in a flight to quality, as clients seek brokers who have a depth of experience and capability. Clients may lean even more toward their broker to assess and recommend markets. More underwriting discipline may come to the market. This is really hard to call; it is just as likely to create more competition in the short term. And high quality underwriting talent is becoming more dispersed. This could lead to a prolonged, healthy, competitive market, with higher levels of innovation, new product offerings and improved service. Now turning to 2016. For the year, we expect to grow underlying revenue, expand margins, deliver strong growth in adjusted EPS and return meaningful capital to shareholders. Starting with organic revenue growth, one of the key strengths of MMC is the diversity of our geographic footprint. It is an important driver of our long-term growth. The developing world should grow faster over the longer term, owing to generally higher levels of GDP growth, under-penetration of insurance and the ability to sell more of our consulting services globally. However, these countries have been experiencing more volatility recently, with many impacted by declines in commodity prices. While there is concern about the emerging world and the overall strength of the global economy, the U.S. and UK continued to perform relatively well. These two countries represent our largest geographies, providing stability to our revenue. On a consolidated basis over the last six years, we have grown underlying revenue in a range of 3% to 5%, and we view this range as the likely outcome for 2016. Underpinning our revenue has been low-single digit GDP growth and benign inflation in the developed world, with modestly better growth in the emerging markets. In addition, we anticipate low-single digit global P&C premium growth as increases in insured values and other exposures should offset the effects of rate reductions. Turning to margins, we have just concluded our eighth consecutive year of margin expansion. Over this period, our adjusted operating margin has improved more than 1,000 basis points to 19.1%. As we have said many times, we do not have a margin target. We view margin expansion as a natural outcome of managing a business properly to grow revenue and earnings. We are disciplined around managing our annual expense growth in line with revenue growth and maintain flexibility to adjust accordingly. While it is conceivable expense growth may exceed revenue growth in a given quarter, we would not expect this to occur for a full year. So, as we look at 2016, we expect to deliver margin expansion in both segments for the seventh consecutive year. Moving to EPS growth, 2015 was an unprecedented year for FX. We posted 8% adjusted EPS growth, or 14.5% on a constant currency basis. If foreign exchange rates remain at their current levels, we anticipate about $0.07 per share of adverse currency impact in 2016, less than half of what we saw last year. Given our current view of FX and global macroeconomic conditions, we expect strong EPS growth in 2016 at a level approaching our long-term target. Turning to capital management. We are a cash business. As we produce high levels of earnings growth, our cash flows should grow at a similar rate. We will continue to deploy capital in excess of our free cash flow. We expect to increase debt balances each year as earnings growth increases our debt capacity. As mentioned on our last earnings call, we anticipate capital deployed in 2016 for dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases to approximate $2.3 billion. We reiterate our annual commitments to reduce our share count and grow our dividend per share by double digits, and we will continue to grow the firm through acquisitions that build our market position, client services and geographic footprint. I also want to spend a few moments on our investment philosophy. We believe in balance and, in this context, it's the balance between delivering strong financial performance today while investing for our future. MMC has a solid foundation and we have the flexibility to deliver strong financial performance in a variety of market conditions. We have balance sheet flexibility to take advantage of opportunities while preserving our ability to manage through periods of stress. Since 2009, we have invested nearly $7 billion for growth and efficiencies. This includes CapEx of $2.2 billion, 115 acquisitions and investments totaling approximately $4.6 billion and an increase in our head count of over 10,000 colleagues. We have also invested in and rewarded our colleagues. In each of the last eight years, our overall global incentive compensation pools have increased while we have driven significant margin expansion. Acquisitions are a core competency of Marsh & McLennan Companies. We don't just buy companies; we develop relationships over time. We see chemistry and a cultural fit. And we invest in growth, not just geographically, but by segment, by line of business and by capability. We were active in 2015, completing 27 acquisitions and investments for approximately $1.2 billion. Lastly, I want to thank our 60,000 colleagues for their contributions. And, in particular, my leadership team. I am privileged to work with a strong leadership team that is defined by high standards, diversity of thought, cohesiveness and collegiality. We are a team that takes its commitments seriously and we have delivered year after year. In summary, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year results, as we continued to execute our long-term strategy for growth. As we look to 2016, we are well-positioned to deliver underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both operating segments and strong EPS growth. With that, let me turn it over to Mark to give you more details on our performance.
Mark Christopher McGivney - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to be joining the call today as the CFO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. MMC capped off the year with an outstanding fourth quarter. We delivered underlying revenue growth across each of our operating companies and both segments generated adjusted operating income growth with margin expansion. GAAP EPS rose 31% including a $37 million pre-tax gain from Mercer's sale of a U.S. defined contribution recordkeeping business. This gain has been excluded from our adjusted results. We believe this presentation is more indicative of the underlying performance of the company. On an adjusted basis, for the quarter EPS increased 8% to $0.71. Our full year 2015 results represent another year of strong performance. Underlying revenue growth was 4% with solid growth at all four operating companies. Adjusted operating income increased 5% to $2.5 billion despite a significant foreign exchange headwind. Our overall adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 19.1%, with both segments contributing. GAAP EPS grew 12% and adjusted EPS rose 8%, in line with the high-single digit guidance we provided throughout the year. For Risk and Insurance Services, revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.7 billion with underlying growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income grew 3% and the margin increased to 21.1%. For the year, underlying revenue growth was 3%, adjusted operating income rose 3% to $1.6 billion and the margin increased 90 basis points to 23.3%, the highest annual margin in over a decade. Adjusted operating margins in RIS have improved every year since 2007. Marsh's fourth quarter performance was strong across the board. Revenue was $1.5 billion, with underlying growth of 4% driven by strong new business. Growth in the quarter was notable as it came on top of 4% growth in the fourth quarter of 2014. The U.S. Canada division grew 3% led by Marsh & McLennan Agency. In the international division, underlying revenue grew 5% with 3% growth in EMEA, reflecting strong performance in the UK, 4% growth in Asia-Pacific and 13% in Latin America. In December, Marsh completed its acquisition of UK-based Jelf Group. This acquisition supports Marsh's strategy to expand globally in the middle market. For the year, Marsh's underlying revenue rose 3%, reflecting growth of 3% in both the U.S. Canada and International division. This was Marsh's fifth consecutive year with underlying revenue growth of at least 3%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $217 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis. EMEA and Latin America were areas of strength. For the full year, underlying revenue growth was 2%, a good result considering the ongoing challenges facing the reinsurance industry. Moving to Consulting. Revenue was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong underlying growth of 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 5% to $265 million. The adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 16.7%, the 16th consecutive quarterly increase. For the year, underlying revenue growth was 5% and adjusted operating income increased 4%, exceeding $1 billion for the first time. Consulting has built a track record of achieving higher adjusted operating margins in recent years. In 2015, the margin expanded 80 basis points to 17.3%, its highest level in over 30 years. Since 2010, Consulting's margins have improved by 600 basis points. Mercer's revenue was $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, an underlying increase of 5%, which follows 5% growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Solid performance was achieved across all three of Mercer's major geographies: North America, EuroPac and Growth Markets. The revenue increase was driven by health, up 8%, and talent, up 7%. Investments rose 2% and retirement grew 1%. Health continues to benefit from growth in both the core business and Mercer Marketplace, and talent once again performed well. In the quarter, Mercer completed several acquisitions, including CPSG Partners, a provider of Workday implementation services. In addition, Mercer successfully completed the sale of its U.S. defined contribution recordkeeping business in the quarter. This activity highlights the strategy Mercer has been executing over the last several years, investing in growth opportunities while deemphasizing areas that do not meet our return requirements or are not core to its business. For the year, Mercer's underlying revenue growth was 4%, with investments increasing 7%, health up 6% and talent up 5%. Retirement was flat. Mercer's underlying revenue growth has been 3% or better for the last five years. Oliver Wyman delivered another strong quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $476 million, reflecting underlying growth of 7%. Growth was driven by Financial Services, Lippincott and the Actuarial business. For the year, Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth was also 7%, which builds on a strong growth of 15% in 2014. As we typically do at this time of year, let me update you regarding our Global Retirement Plan. As you may recall, in the first quarter of 2015 we recognized a non-recurring credit of $125 million as a result of changes to our U.S. Post-65 Retiree Medical Plan. This action represented a substantial portion of the mitigation we undertook to offset the increase in annual retiring (23:05) expense we faced last year due to declines in global interest rates. Late in 2015, we made additional retirement plan changes that essentially replaced this credit, not only through 2016, but beyond. As discussed on our last earnings call, the most impactful change was in the structure of our U.S. defined benefit plan, where it was divided into two separate plans. This structure better positions the company to take advantage of derisking opportunity. It also resulted in extending the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses in the inactive plan. This lowers annual pension expense. As a result of these changes coupled with the many other factors that go into determining the year-end measurement of our pension expense, we expect a year-over-year decline in retirement expense of approximately $30 million for 2016, or $0.04 per share. Turning to investment income. In the third quarter of 2015, we recognized investment income of $29 million from the final settlement of our Trident III investment. At year-end, our private equity portfolio amounted to $76 million, and we expect to generate only modest investment income going forward versus the $38 million we recognized in 2015. The anticipated reduction in our investment income for 2016 should essentially offset the $0.04 benefit from lower retirement expense. As we anticipated on our earnings call in October, the FX headwind in the fourth quarter was $0.05 per share and $0.18 for the year. This was by far the highest annual level of FX impact in MMC's history. If foreign exchange rates remain at their current levels, we expect FX to adversely affect EPS by approximately $0.07 in 2016. The majority of the impact will be felt in the first half of the year. Our tax rate fluctuates quarter-to-quarter reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years and changes in international and local tax rates. Our adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter was 29.7% and the rate for the year was 28.7%, reflecting discrete items. Based on the current landscape, for modeling purposes it would be reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% in 2016. Total balance sheet debt at year-end was $4.4 billion, slightly below the third quarter level, reflecting the recent repayment of a $50 million term loan. In 2015, balance sheet debt increased by approximately $1 billion. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us significant flexibility with few near-term repayment obligations. Our next debt maturity is a $250 million senior note due in April 2017. Due to the substantial work we have done to restructure our debt over the last three years, our average cost of debt has fallen to 3.7%. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our stock for $75 million. For the year, we bought back 24.8 million shares for $1.4 billion, the highest level in our history. As we mentioned on our third quarter call, we pulled forward a portion of the share repurchases we had plans for both the fourth quarter and 2016. As a result, our buyback activity is expected to be less than 2015. As Dan mentioned, this year we expect to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital across share repurchase, acquisitions and dividends. In 2015, we returned over $2 billion of capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Overall, we deployed $3.2 billion of capital across share buybacks, acquisitions and dividends, a record year of capital deployment for MMC. Sources of this capital included our operating cash flows, the addition of $1 billion of balance sheet debt and a reduction of $600 million in balance sheet cash. Since 2013, we have added $1.5 billion of balance sheet debt and reduced our cash balance by over $900 million. For the year, uses of cash included $632 million per dividend, $1.2 billion for acquisitions and investments and $1.4 billion for share repurchases. For the fourth quarter, we deployed $811 million of cash that included $164 million for dividends, $572 million for acquisitions and $75 million for share repurchases. Cash on our balance sheet at year-end stood at $1.4 billion, which was down from $2 billion at the end of 2014. Cash in the U.S. was $580 million. Once again, in 2015 we delivered on our capital return commitments. We reduced our share count by more than 3% and increased our dividends per share by over 11%. With that, I'm happy to turn the call back over to Dan.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Mark. Operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. We'll have our first question from Ryan Tunis, Credit Suisse.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I think my first question is for Dan. I think it's in response to talking about 2016 growth. And I think you said that hoping it approaches the longer term target, which is 13%. And I guess thinking about the currency headwind, that would seem to imply a pretty decent chunk of either organic growth or margin expansion. So I'm just wondering if there's anything outside of those segments – I don't know if it's tax rate or anything along those lines that might help push that growth rate upward.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Thanks, Ryan. Actually, in terms of how we get close to our long-term target and, in fact, achieve it over the long term, there's no magic formula. It has basically, obviously, top-line growth is a significant factor. And the more we grow the top line, the easier it is to expand margins. Although we have proven our ability to expand margins even in times of pretty low organic growth. We feel very comfortable that when you look over the last number of years how we have grown in the 3% to 5% organic growth area that for 2016, the way it feels like to us is that we'll be in that range and we will have margin expansion in both segments and, therefore, our operating earnings will be quite strong. And fundamentally that is the backbone to how we will deliver EPS growth. So, there's nothing in our current thinking of it that involves issues like tax, et cetera. The one thing we don't control is FX. We don't control the macroeconomic conditions in the world either, but we're less concerned about that because that sort of has a lag factor. But FX hits you between the eyes in any one quarter and in any one year. But if you look at our results, even in 2015 on a constant currency basis, it was very strong and we would expect that to continue in 2016.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up for Mark. I think, first of all, how should we think about just cash pension contributions next year relative to this year? And then also just wanted to make sure I understand these changes correctly. Is it such that – that's on the U.S. benefit plans. Is it such that if interest rates do remain low that you will not need to continue to come up with new mitigating factors in the coming years? Is it such that over the next few years that this is sort of a permanent offset if interest rates remain low? Am I thinking about that right?
Mark Christopher McGivney - Chief Financial Officer: That's right, Ryan. The change to the U.S. plan is sort of baked into the base, so that will persist. In terms of cash contribution, in 2015 we contributed $195 million and we expect only a modest uptick in 2016, around $217 million.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. That's all. Thanks.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks a lot. Next question, please?
Operator: Charles Sebaski, BMO Capital Markets.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning. Thank you. I was hoping to get a little bit more color on MMA and thoughts on the organic growth, where it stands in size now, if there's any disparity between that and the more traditional Marsh book in terms of growth of profile or margin contribution. Anything you provide, I'd appreciate.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So I'll take that to begin with and then hand it over to Peter to give more commentary. But the MMA is a core strategy of the firm and really was approved by the company's board in July of 2008. And I point that out just to say we've not only had changes of CEO at the parent company level, we've also had changes of CEO at the Marsh subsidiary level. But the strategy itself we've stuck to it, we've done the hard yards and we've built the business over multi years that we're incredibly proud of and we think well positioned for throughout future. We always said in the past that we expected MMA to be able to deliver organic growth which was stronger than Marsh U.S. over time at an EBITDA margin which would be similar to Marsh's overall margins. And so, Peter, do you want to add to that?
Peter Zaffino - President & Chief Executive Officer, Marsh LLC: Thanks, Dan. As Dan said, that this has always been a well thought-out strategy. We like the segment in the middle market and it has been one that we wanted to grow in through acquisition and through organic growth. We've been able to attract the highest quality agencies in building MMA. And attributes of high-quality agencies are terrific people, track records of strong organic growth and they've been able to do that once we've acquired them. Then we have shared best practices across those high-quality agencies, and so that quality has led to more quality. A big part of the organic growth, though, is not only have we acquired high-quality agencies, we've invested a lot of in our sales capacity. And so we're trying to grow net sales capacity each and every year. We now have over 700 full-time producers within MMA and that makes a very big difference. And then lastly is that Dave Eslick and his leadership team have executed very well. So, not only are we growing the segment that's strategically where we wanted to be in, attracting the highest quality agencies, we're also investing in executing on sales capacity. And so the growth has been balanced across the U.S. and balanced between the H&V (34:57) and Property and Casualty.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Could you let us let us know what the revenue is for 2015 for MMA?
Peter Zaffino - President & Chief Executive Officer, Marsh LLC: Well, the estimated annualized revenue is around $900 million.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Excellent. I appreciate that. I guess just another for overall business on the P&C side and regarding the growth for 2016. What's the pricing expectation do you have kind of baked in for the P&C market? And I guess, overall, how much of the business today is commission versus fee-based? So I'm trying to get some understanding or appreciation of the sensitivity to changes in P&C pricing.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I'll take that to start and hand over to Peter. First, whatever percentage we give you on commissions versus fees, I would bear in mind that it's not a direct insulation. If there's a prolonged, long-term soft market, it puts downward pressure on fees as well in a competitive environment. So it's not that fee business is completely insulated from the vagaries of the market. But having said that, when you look at how we run the company, over long stretches of time because of the amount of capital and competition amongst insurance companies on a global basis, we expect there to generally be a downward trend on rating levels. Now, insurance rates are the most important thing in a lot of respects to an insurance company. Insurance premiums are more important to intermediaries. And so when we look at exposure units and other factors around the world, we expect to see some slight growth in insurance premiums notwithstanding some of the downward pressure that is existing on rating levels. But, Peter, you want to add to that?
Peter Zaffino - President & Chief Executive Officer, Marsh LLC: There's not a lot to add, Dan. I think you captured a lot of it. I think what we've seen in the pricing has been – we've seen more falloff in 2015 compared to 2014. But the sequential from quarter to quarter we have not seen accelerate. So, we have seen more rate come off in 2015 in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. And so we would expect that in 2016, it will be modest. I don't see it significantly accelerating. We've seen property come off a little bit more, but it's been very orderly, very measured, and we think it would be a balance. In terms of how you should think about commission versus fee, we've mentioned that we're growing a lot in MMA, and so the commission we'll book is growing as a overall percentage of the book, not only from organic growth but as we're making more acquisitions, and then the international is driven more by commission.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So thank you, Charles.
Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you very much.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Next question, please? Thank you, Charles. Next question.
Operator: Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. I was hoping to...
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: ...to spend some time on the outlook for Guy Carpenter. The growth picked up in the fourth quarter. So, first of all, was there anything kind of one time in there? And then also as you think about 2016 and the outlook for the rating environment as well as new business there, how do you see the growth within Guy Carpenter for the coming year?
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, and so first I just like to say about Guy Carpenter, it's been some tough sledding over the last couple of years of market conditions. But when we look over a long period of time, Guy Carpenter has grown its underlying revenue 22 out of the last 24 quarters. So, we feel very good about how they're positioned and what they're delivering to the firm, truly one of our crown jewels. But, Alex, you want to add to this?
Alexander S. Moczarski - President and CEO, Guy Carpenter & Co., LLC: Thanks, Dan. So, let's bear in mind that the fourth quarter is our smallest quarter. But obviously we're very pleased with the 5%, and that came from good client retention. We had strong new facultative business in Latin America and the UK. And Marine Specialty, Continental Europe and U.S. facultative all outperformed. In addition, we got a maximum performance bonus from a major global client. So there's nothing one-off about it, but bear in mind it is our smallest quarter. We remain innovative and we remain relevant to our different segments. We've added new resources to our existing highly talented pool. We made investments in leading-edge client-facing technologies, and these are being recognized by our clients. And we're harnessing the alternative capital. We were top of the leagues in the cat bond space last year and we've got a good pipeline coming on. And the good news I think is that some of our major clients have signaled their interests in returning to the reinsurance markets to meet their capital needs. So we can seek and expect revenue growth for this year. I'm not sure how much it's going to be. It may be bumpy. But we're a growth company and that's the way. We lean forward.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, I think, from where we sit today, I mean, we'll know more as the year progresses. But from where we sit today, if you look at Guy Carpenter's performance in 2015, it's probably the best indication of the full-year performance as to what we would expect in 2016 as well.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thank you. And then in terms of the acquisition pipeline, you, in your remarks, said that it was in good shape. Have you guys seen any change in multiples on transactions? And then also, as you think about 2016 and your capital plan, you did end the year with a sizeable transaction with the Jelf Group. How do you think about the size of potential transactions that are in the pipeline and what you might consider going forward?
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good question. A complicated question. It's got several parts to it. So let me talk about it broadly for a second. First of all, we do have a good pipeline. both in RIS and in consulting. It is a global pipeline. When we evaluate our pipeline, though, we generally look at a lot of different things or at least cast a glance over a lot of different things but do very few for a variety of reasons. So even last year, which was a very active year for us where we had 27 acquisitions and investments, we actually reviewed more than 10 times the amount of what we actually did. And so that gives you an idea of the labyrinth that needs to go through for us to say we want to do this acquisition and conclude it. And multiples are a factor. I mean, last year I can tell you even though we did $1.2 billion of transaction in terms of transaction value, we walked away from well more than $1.2 billion of transaction value and generally we walked away because of either concerns about growth, the difference between our view of what the potential growth could be in the future rather than the seller's view of what the potential growth could be, or price expectations. And so we believe we're disciplined. Clearly over a course of a number years we've seen some multiple expansion, particularly for larger type of acquisitions because that attracts PE and other parties to it. But actually for mid-size, smaller, folding, tuck-in type of acquisitions, the multiples, while they may be a bit more than they were five years ago, we still think are quite reasonable. And if you look at our real strategy, I think you would see Jelf was a bit of an outlier size-wise, not much of an outlier, but a bit. You look at the acquisitions that we've done over the last five years. The average acquisition transaction value has been a bit about $40 million per transaction. And so it's more of a string of pearls than chunkier than that. They'll be the odd larger company, but it's not a change in strategy in any way. Now, in terms of capital plan, Mark, do you have some comments on that?
Mark Christopher McGivney - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. I think, overall, we maintained a balanced approach to a lot of elements of our strategy, and capital is no exception. As Dan said, we firmly believe that to drive value over the long term, we're going to consistently and continue to invest or reinvest in the business through M&A to extend our business, build our business. As he talked about, we maintain high standards in terms of discipline and expected returns. We expect to maintain this balance going forward. But it is balanced. And if you refer back to what we did in 2015, we deployed $1.2 billion of capital to acquisitions, but $2 billion of capital was returned to shareholders.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And so if you look at our overall, we've been talking about returning capital of about $2.3 billion-ish for 2016. And if you think in terms of dividend, that probably is a number like $650 million to $700 million with a double-digit increase that we would deliver in 2016, which leaves you $1.6 billion maybe $1.7 billion between acquisitions and share repurchase. And the acquisition number is a question mark because we have no budget around acquisitions. But that level of return would exist and generally we would prefer if it was close to being balanced. But we'll work through that. Any other questions, Elyse?
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: No. That was great. Thank you very much.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Perfect. Thank you. Next question?
Operator: Quentin McMillan, KBW.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks very much, guys. I wanted to first ask just about the global growth in the RIS segment, particularly Latin America was obviously really strong this quarter. Wanting to understand if that was a little bit more chunky one-off because it was obviously a fairly challenged macro down there. And then more largely, what you're seeing in the developing markets and what you look for for 2016.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll hand over to Peter in a second, but I just can't resist celebrating our business in Latin America a little bit. So, Peter, I'm sorry if take some of the thunder on it. But I just want to say the fourth quarter and also the year, it's not at an anomaly at all for Marsh in Latin America. Marsh Latin America has grown underlying revenue 8% or more for six straight years. So, a tremendously strong performance through good times and tough times. So, Peter, do you want to add?
Peter Zaffino - President & Chief Executive Officer, Marsh LLC: We had a terrific fourth quarter. 13% was led by Peru, Mexico and Colombia. So, those are three out of the four top countries in terms of size in Latin America. We did have a weaker fourth quarter in 2014. So perhaps the growth is a little bit more than perhaps the run rate. We did 8% for the year. But if I look at the fundamentals, we had really strong client retention, very good renewal growth from the rollover of new business in the prior year. But, again, strong client retention, and we grew through new business. So, they really executed on a balanced basis and really pleased with the recovery for the year. And as Dan said, it's been six straight years with 8% or greater. And we just have a terrific business there.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: All right. Great. Thanks so much. And then just following up on the M&A question, 2hat we've seen in the high-yield markets of spreads really starting to widen seems like it's going to make it harder for some of those private equity competitors who have been bidding up these deals, as you previously alluded to, to continue to try to maybe outbid you, guys or pay economic values that are just not sustainable. A, is that a trend that you have seen in any way in the marketplace so far? And, B, is that something that you guys are monitoring and think could be a potential positive going down the line?
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So it's certainly a potential positive. It takes a while to turn up, I would say. So, we haven't seen anything and we very rarely actually compete with PE. I know plenty of people do, but ultimately our general attitude with regard to acquisitions is we very rarely, if at all, participate in auctions and, if PE is involved, we almost always take a pass because we want the owners to have made up their mind as to whether they want to be part of Marsh & McLennan Companies, part of a strategic long-term viable operation or whether they're looking to optimize compensation in the short term and they're willing to roll the dice as to what the ultimate outcome and the ultimate owner someday down the road would be. And so we don't bump up against PE as much as you would think.
Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks so much, guys.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Next question, please?
Operator: We have no further questions in the queue at this time.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Well, that's fine. That's probably a record. But I would just like to thank everybody for joining us this morning and thank our colleagues specifically for their support and our clients for all the good things that we do together and wish everybody a good day. Thank you very much.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies' conference call. Today's call is being recorded. Third quarter 2015 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risk and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's most recent SEC filings which are available on the MMC website for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn over the conference to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO; and our operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh of Investor Relations. I am pleased with our results for both the third quarter and nine months. Over these periods, we produced underlying revenue growth across all operating companies, along with higher adjusted operating income and margin expansion in both segments. For the nine months, adjusted EPS rose 8%. We continue to execute and grow in a challenging macro environment. As a global growth company, we are not immune to the effects of modest global GDP growth, low interest rates, a strong U.S. dollar or the slowdown in emerging economies. Despite this environment, we are on track for 2015 to be the sixth consecutive year that we have generated underlying revenue growth of at least 3%. We have several attributes which make us optimistic about our ability to generate good, long-term revenue growth. We have a vast geographic footprint in all of our businesses, especially RIS. This gives us the balance to benefit from varying levels of global growth. In most years, global premiums tend to rise despite negative pricing trends. In addition, we view risk as a growth business. Increasing exposures from new emerging risk, globalization and economic uncertainty create volatility and disruption. Our clients' need for advice and services is only rising. We are able to meet these needs through the quality and depth of our colleague base and our collaborative and cohesive culture. This underpins our consistent long-term revenue growth, both organic and acquired at RIS. In addition, we are well positioned to benefit from favorable long term global trends in consulting. At Mercer, the need for advice around issues of health, wealth and career are increasing. Mercer is a trusted advisor, serving clients and their more than 110 million employees in over 100 countries. Oliver Wyman provides deep industry knowledge and strategic expertise to their clients around issues of growth, change and efficiency. We also use capital management to drive growth. Through nine months, we have already exceeded the $2.3 billion of capital deployed for acquisitions, dividends and buybacks for all of 2014. The primary sources of this capital have been increasing levels of operating cash flow and using our balance sheet. In 2015, we raised $1.1 billion of incremental debt and we continue to work down cash balances. While capital utilization has been substantial, we have maintained balance sheet flexibility, which we believe is prudent. We manage for the long-term and reinvestment is a constant. We invest through cycles and preserve our ability to take advantage of periods of dislocation to invest in our colleagues and capabilities, add to our talent base, and make acquisitions. This balanced strategy has served us well as evidenced by our ability to deliver in a variety of market environments. Now let's turn to our results. In the third quarter, we produced underlying revenue growth of 4%, 6% growth in adjusted operating income, a 100 basis point rise in our adjusted operating margin to 15.6%, our highest third-quarter margin in more than a decade, and 13% growth in adjusted EPS. Through nine months, underlying revenue rose 3%, adjusted operating income was up 5%, the margin expanded 120 basis points, and adjusted EPS increased 8%. For Risk and Insurance Services, revenue in the third quarter was $1.6 billion, with underlying growth of 2%, adjusted operating income grew 3%, and the margin increased 70 basis points to 15.7%. Through nine months, underlying revenue growth was 2%, adjusted operating income rose 4% to $1.2 billion, and the margin increased 130 basis points to 24.1%, the highest in over a decade. This margin improvement continues a march we have been on since 2007, when adjusted margins in the RIS segment were at their lowest. At Marsh, revenue in the third quarter was $1.3 billion, with underlying growth of 2%. The U.S./Canada division grew 2%, led by Marsh and McLennan Agency. The MMA strategy has been very successful. Since 2009, MMA has made approximately 50 acquisitions with annualized revenues approaching $900 million. In our International division, the increase was also 2%, reflecting modest growth in EMEA and Asia-Pacific, and a 6% increase in Latin America. In September, Marsh announced its intention to acquire U.K.-based insurance broker, Jelf Group. This aligns with Marsh's strategy to expand globally in the SME space. We expect the transaction to close within the next several months. With the recent acquisition of Dovetail, Marsh continues to broaden its services in the small commercial segment. Dovetail's flexible and scalable technology offers agents access to online real-time quoting and binding from multiple insurance providers. Through nine months, Marsh's underlying revenue was up 3%, reflecting growth of 3% in U.S./Canada and 2% in the International division. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $261 million in the third quarter, an increase of 2% on an underlying basis and 1% through nine months. This was a reasonable result considering the significant rate reductions in many lines. The U.S. and EMEA were areas of strength driven by strong retention rates and new business wins in treaty. Moving to Consulting, revenue was $1.5 billion in the third quarter, reflecting strong underlying growth of 6%. Adjusted operating income increased 4% to $285 million. The adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 18.5%, the 15th consecutive quarterly increase. Similar to RIS, consulting has a record of achieving higher adjusted operating margins in recent years. The improvement has been at least 150 basis points in each of the past three years, and with additional expansion so far in 2015, the third quarter margin was the highest in over 30 years. Through nine months, underlying revenue growth was 5%, adjusted operating income increased 4% and the margin expanded 90 basis points to 17.5%. Mercer's revenue was $1.1 billion in the third quarter, reflecting an underlying increase of 5%. Revenue growth was achieved across all three of Mercer's major geographies – North America, Euro-Pac and growth markets. Mercer's growth was broad-based with investments, talent and health each growing 6%. Retirement rose 2%. Investments continued its long-term positive performance. AUM increased to $138 billion as new client assets more than offset market and FX pressure. Talent once again performed well. It generated its fourth consecutive quarter of growth driven by its seasonally strong survey business and increased demand for project consultancy work. Mercer recently announced a strategic alliance with Transamerica, which will acquire Mercer's U.S. defined contribution record-keeping business. Mercer continues to directly serve client benefit administration needs in both the defined benefit and health businesses. The Transamerica alliance enables an integrated total benefit outsourcing solution. Health continues to benefit from Mercer Marketplace, despite lower growth in our administration business as we execute our strategy to improve profitability. Earlier this month, we issued an update on the progress of Mercer Marketplace. In total, the exchange now serves over 700,000 employees and retirees, and provides exchange access for an anticipated 1.5 million lives, an increase of 43% compared with last year. We are pleased with the continuing growth of Mercer Marketplace, although we would highlight we do not expect it to contribute to earnings in 2016. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the third quarter was $450 million, reflecting strong underlying growth of 9%. Through nine months, we are pleased with Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth of 6%, which builds on growth of 15% in the same period last year. The nine months' performance reflected revenue growth in all practice groups and business units. In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter and nine months' results as we continue to execute well. For the full year, we expect to deliver underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both operating segments, and high single-digit EPS growth. With that, let me turn it over to Mike.
J. Michael Bischoff - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we delivered underlying revenue growth in each of our operating companies. Both segments generated adjusted operating income growth with margin expansion. GAAP EPS rose 13% and adjusted EPS increased 13% as well. Considering the macro headwinds we are facing and our mitigation activities, we believe you get a clearer picture of earnings growth and margin improvement by gearing our results on a year-to-date basis. Our financial results through nine months show adjusted operating income increased 5% to $1.9 billion, the adjusted operating margin expanded from 18.5% to 19.7%, with RIS expanding 130 basis points and consulting increasing 90 basis points. Both GAAP and adjusted EPS increased 8%, indicative of our progress this year. Our results are being impacted significantly by the strength of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, especially the Euro. And in the second half of the year, the dollar has continued to strength against the Canadian and Australian dollar, and the currencies of most emerging markets. At the beginning of the year, we estimated the negative impact to EPS from foreign exchange would be approximately $0.15 per share, the highest level in MMC's history. We now estimate the full-year impact will be $0.18 per share – $0.06 in the first quarter, $0.04 in the second, $0.03 in the third and we now expect a $0.05 impact in the fourth quarter. We recently changed the structure of our U.S. defined benefit plan by dividing it into two separate plans, one that includes active colleagues and a second that includes inactives which account for about 70% of U.S. plan participants, both retiree and terminated vested. This structure better positions MMC to take advantage of derisking opportunities in the future such as voluntary lump sum offers and annuity purchases. This change has no effect on the future benefits earned by our U.S. colleagues or the benefits previously earned by former colleagues. We are using a longer amortization period for the inactive plan, which will lower annual pension expense although the benefit this year is modest. Many factors go into determining our pension expense: assumptions for mortality changes, asset performance and the discount rate, to name a few. As we typically do each year, we will provide an outlook for MMC's retirement plan expense on our fourth quarter earnings call in February, after the year-end measurement. While it is too early to give an estimate for next year, based upon the variety of factors we are looking at today, we believe the company is well-positioned to offset any retirement expense headwind we could face in 2016. Investment income. Trident III, which was created in 2003, sold its last two investments in the third quarter. As a result, MMC's carried interest is no longer subject to clawback. In the third quarter, the $34 million of investment income primarily came from Trident III. For the nine months, investment income was $39 million, a slight increase from $37 million last year. MMC's private equity portfolio is $85 million, which should generate only modest investment income on an annual basis. Total debt was $4.5 billion at the end of the third quarter. We took advantage of favorable credit market conditions by pulling forward the debt issuance we had contemplated for the first quarter of next year. Also influencing this decision was our robust acquisition pipeline, and we wanted to take advantage of the decline in the equity markets to repurchase our shares at attractive prices. The $600 million senior note issued in September has an interest rate of 3.75% and will mature in 2026. We've been restructuring our debt portfolio the last several years and have reduced our average interest rate from 5.6% to 3.5%. Our annual interest expense in 2011 was $200 million with $3 billion of debt outstanding. Today, with $4.5 billion of debt, our annual interest expense would approximately $175 million. We have reduced our refinancing risk by spreading out maturities over a number of years. For example, the next bond repayment of $250 million is not due until April of 2017. The debt is supported by a significantly higher level of operating earnings. The company is in a strong financial position today. Over the last few years, we have used our balance sheet while maintaining flexibility to take advantage of growth opportunities. The recent volatility in the equity markets allowed us to pull forward a portion of our share repurchases planned for the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year. We repurchased 9.9 million shares in the third quarter for $550 million and over the first nine months we repurchased 23.4 million shares for $1.3 billion. Our tax rates fluctuates quarter-to-quarter reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years and changes in international and local rates. For the third quarter, our adjusted tax rate was 28.4%. This represents an underlying tax rate of 29.5% and a slight benefit related to filing our 2014 federal tax return in September. For modeling purposes, based on the current landscape it would be reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29.5% in the fourth quarter and 29% for 2016. Our cash at the end of the third quarter was $1.3 billion with $445 million in the U.S. Uses of cash in the third quarter included $165 million for dividends, $190 million for acquisitions and $550 million for share repurchases. Through nine months, uses of cash included $470 million for dividends, $590 million for acquisitions and adjustments and $1.3 billion for share repurchases. At our Investor Day in March 2014, we made two commitments concerning returning capital to shareholders: one, double-digit annual dividend increases; and two, a reduction in our share count each year. We are delivering on these commitments for 2015, as we did in 2014. Our annual dividend increased 11.3% this year after increasing 10.4% last year. Our share count will decline for the second straight year. In fact, shares outstanding has declined by 27 million shares since Investor Day. Capital deployed for share repurchases, dividends and acquisitions was $1.2 billion for 2013. In 2014, capital deployed almost doubled, to $2.3 billion; and through the first nine months of this year totaled $2.4 billion. Our robust capital management has been supported by strong operating cash flows, the deployment of excess cash and increased debt. With that, I am happy to turn it back to Dan.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Mike. Before we go to Q&A, I would like to make a few comments about our recently announced CFO transition. Mark McGivney will become MMC's Chief Financial Officer at the start of 2016. Over the past year in his current position as Senior Vice-President of MMC Corporate Finance, Mark worked closely with Mike and me in developing and executing our financial strategy. Mark also has a very strong operational background and becomes the first MMC Chief Financial Officer to have served as CFO of both Marsh and Mercer. Mark was CFO at Marsh from 2007 to 2011, where he was a key member of my leadership team and oversaw substantial restructuring actions and operational improvements that re-established Marsh's profitability. From 2011 to 2014, Mark was CFO and Chief Operating Officer of Mercer, where he worked closely with Julio to drive strong improvement at Mercer. Welcome, Mark. We look forward to hearing from you on next quarter's earnings call. I would also like to say a few words about Mike, and to take a moment to recognize the many contributions he has made to Marsh and McLennan Companies over the past 34 years, the last three-and-a-half as Chief Financial Officer. Mike has worked tirelessly and creatively on an array of complex issues in leading our finance colleagues around the globe. By always demonstrating tremendous skill, knowledge and judgment, Mike leaves a legacy of extraordinary professionalism, commitment and dedication for us to build upon in the future. I am pleased that Mike will serve as a part-time senior advisor to MMC through the first quarter of 2016. On behalf of the 58,000 colleagues at Marsh and McLennan Companies around the world, I would like to say thank you, Mike, for your outstanding service. Operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: We'll have our first question from Dan Farrell, Piper Jaffray.
Daniel D. Farrell - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Thank you, and good morning. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the brokerage, organic specifically in Marsh, we're seeing a little slowdown in both the U.S. and internationally? Could you give us a little more color in terms of sort of headwinds from both pricing and exposure? And then could you talk about your abilities to offset that with net new business and how much you think you can offset further headwinds? Thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I think because much of the impact on our revenue as a company relates to some macro factors, like GDP or the P&C cycle, maybe it would be a good idea for me to give just a very brief comment, and then just go around the horn and have each of our operating companies give an assessment as to how they're – what they're looking at today and as they look forward – for revenue growth. And so I'm pretty pleased, because despite macro headwinds, as I mentioned from GDP, property and casualty rate, and some tough comps, MMC grew revenue by 4%. And year-to-date, revenue growth underlying is up 3% versus the prior year-to-date at 5%. So I feel pretty good about where we are and I'm confident that we remain in the 3% to 5% underlying revenue growth zone as an overall company. But Peter, do you want to start with Marsh?
Peter Zaffino - Chairman - Risk & Insurance Services and President & Chief Executive Officer - Marsh, LLC, Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. It's probably helpful to put a little context around the numbers for the quarter. Compared to last year's quarter three, again, it was a 5% organic growth so it was going to be challenging for us; that was the highest underlying growth rate we've had in the past 12 quarters, so it is a tough comparable year-over-year. Some countries have been particularly challenged, specifically in large, commodity-based economies like Australia, Canada, Brazil, even parts of Africa. So those have been a little bit of a headwind. And you mentioned pricing. Pricing has been orderly, but it has been coming off year-over-year and slightly from the second quarter to third quarter. We have been undergoing several yield initiatives to offset some of the rate decreases, and there's been some economic growth, albeit slow, in sales, payroll, total insured values. So overall, the 2% is not what we believe will be our medium- and long-term growth rates. But overall, when I look at the core, underlying parts of the business, new business, client retention is very strong.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks, Peter. Alex?
Alexander Moczarski - Chairman; President and Chief Executive Officer, Guy Carpenter & Company LLC, Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. The headwinds in the reinsurance area are well known, have been discussed, I guess, pretty much over the last three or four years. But we've continued to be able to grow. I said at the beginning of the year that some quarters might be clunky, but at the end of the day, we are still feeling fairly positive. The pipeline remains good. We're benefiting from segmentation and specialization. Shares have actually grown with the mid- to larger-sized insurance companies as they find our how good our teams are, how useful our tools are, and how sophisticated our solutions are. So, we're still looking in growth mode.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So that takes care of RIS. Why don't we spend a little time on consulting, so Julio, you want to talk to us about revenue growth?
Julio A. Portalatin - President & Chief Executive Officer, Mercer LLC,: Thanks, Dan. First, I'd like to just start off by saying that we were pretty pleased with the solid revenue growth that we had and demonstrated in the third quarter. I was particularly pleased with the balance of that growth across our LOBs [lines of business]. And you know we have a habit now of, quarter after quarter, finding a way to continue to have that spread between revenue growth and expenses so, of course, our margin continues to also improve. We've entered into a strategic alliance with Transamerica, which we think is going to be good for our clients, good for our going forward. And it continues to reinforce, as we've talked about in the past, dis-investing in some of our non-core, as we continue to invest in our core for growth into the future. Things like bolstering our talent business, investing in things like building Mercer Marketplace, and expanding our solutions even further in things like Workday with implementation capabilities, Jeitosa, et cetera. And expanding also our European investment capabilities, which has shown up in some of the improvement that we've had in assets under management, going to $1.38 billion this particular quarter. So our investments have been well-calculated. We continue to look for opportunities to accelerate our growth into the future by increasing footprint across the globe and doing other things. So we're pretty optimistic about how we can continue to generate growth at Mercer.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. And just rounding it all out, Scott.
Scott McDonald - Chief Executive Officer, Oliver Wyman Group, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.: Sure. Dan, Oliver Wyman had a good quarter and year-to-date we've had strong growth across most sectors. In the nine months, all of financial services, health, actuarial, Lippincott and NERA grew more than 7%. And in any annual period, we continue to target growth planned at the range for MMC that Dan highlighted, so say 5% or better, driven by continued growth in the demand for high quality consulting as well as our ability to take share from competitors. It is important to keep in mind though, that given the nature of much of our business which is large, lumpy consulting projects, there'll certainly be volatility around that target from quarter-to-quarter. But overall, the business is in good shape and getting better, so we expect to be able to continue to grow.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, tanks. Dan, I know that was an overall long question but I figured revenue was likely to be on several people's minds so we wanted to cover it broadly. Do you have any other question?
Daniel D. Farrell - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): No, that's helpful detail across all the segments. Thank you and Mike, all the best to you going forward.
J. Michael Bischoff - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Dan.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Next question, please.
Operator: Ryan Tunis, Credit Suisse.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, thanks, good morning. I guess my first question is for Mike and it's on the U.S. benefit plan, I guess, some of the optionality you've maybe created there. And you mentioned lump sums and perhaps some other alternatives. It sounds like to me that would probably eliminate some of the interest rate sensitivity you've seen around the pension expense and also maybe mitigate it. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly as a positive. And I guess, I don't want to call it a negative, but presumably this would also come with a cost, and would doing a lump sum or a close-out or that type of thing create a meaningful near-term use of cash?
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me start, Ryan and then I'll hand over to Mike. I think it's too premature to consider the cost of buyouts, et cetera, because we haven't determined yet whether we would offer a discount, if any, to the actual carrying costs that we have for those benefits. And so, we're at the early stages of working through those issues. We think that structurally setting up the two plans make it easier for us to address things like annuity buyouts and lump sum arrangements in an overall derisking effort for our inactives. But overall, I'll hand to Mike to see if he's got additional color. So, Mike?
J. Michael Bischoff - Chief Financial Officer: Dan, you're exactly right. It takes a lot of time and effort at different stages to go through in looking at any major or substantial change to a defined benefit program. So we've actually been looking at the changes that may be inherent in the U.S. DB plan for a number of years, did the administrative work and then implemented the change to basically separate the DB plan into two separate plans, one active and one inactive. As Dan indicated, this is just a step along the road and we haven't made a decision on the timing of when to offer lump sum buyouts or annuity purchases. This will come in the future. The other thing that, Ryan, I would just put into context for you, the U.S. is our second largest plan. The U.K. is by far our largest plan, and then after the U.S. is followed by Canada and Ireland. We actually made some changes in Ireland as well. So, this is more of a long-term philosophical approach to organize all of our plans on a geographic basis, but do it within a common umbrella that Dan and the management team have established.
Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Okay. And then I guess just shifting gears to exchanges. I think you mentioned that next year, despite 40% plus enrollee growth, not expected to be a contributor to earnings. And I guess just to get a better understanding of how that's impacting consulting margins, how does that roughly compare to the contribution of exchanges this year to the bottom line?
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll start with that and then I'll hand it over to Julio. I think the important thing to note is when we're looking at our exchange, the most important thing to us now is creating a platform and a framework for us to handle a lot of lives and to grow on a rapid but pretty consistent basis for many years to come. And so it really is all about creating the right quality organization. And I was quite pleased when I saw some of the survey data from clients of ours who've used our call center, and their satisfaction levels which were in the upper 90%'s and were even an improvement on last year. But you know for us in early stages you have to look at this as really a startup organization in some ways. And from that perspective, it's not going to be meaningful to earnings, at least on a MMC basis, for quite a while. And so, I just specifically wanted us to comment on it because I see some notes from time to time out there which just seemed to me that some folks might be getting ahead of themselves a little bit, and so we wanted to make some specific comments. But Julio, do you want to add to that?
Julio A. Portalatin - President & Chief Executive Officer, Mercer LLC,: Not too much more to add, Dan. I think that was well answered. But in the context of overall MMC, $13 billion revenue, and then you think about the approximate $4.4 billion of revenue of Mercer, and then you think about the $1.5 billion global revenue we have in H&B, in context, this is clearly a growth strategy for us. And we are wearing the results within the P&L results of Mercer. And we will continue to do that, and I think that we have demonstrated that we can manage that in the context of the improvements that we've had in our margin over the last several years now. So, we'll continue to do that in time-and-time. And by the way, there are other things we invest in too, that we also wear inside the Mercer results and we'll continue to do that as well.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's really a great position to be in, to be able to deliver significant margin improvement in both RIS and in Consulting, while we're investing in those businesses and while we're acquiring in those businesses, and wearing higher amortization and deal costs, et cetera, et cetera. Next question, please.
Operator: Josh Shanker, Deutsche Bank.
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thank you. So I don't want to turn this into an exchange conversation, we've been through this before. But if you just walk through the process – and I think we've been through it in some places – on a current customer, if they choose to go onto your exchange, where do you lose revenues? Where do you gain revenues? And how do we see that come through the P&L?
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Well, a couple of things. One, half of the new clients that we had on the exchange this year were actually new H&B clients from Mercer, so that is an improvement over last year and shows the draw of the actual concept of an exchange. As Julio has mentioned before, our anticipation over a long period of time would be that when it's fully up and running, at scale, et cetera, that the likely exchange type of margin would be similar to the H&B margins that we have in a regular transaction; of course, supplemented and supported by the voluntary benefits programs that we sell through the exchange. And so, overall, I think it's way premature to even consider the margins. This is off into the future in terms of what our expectations are. And I can just tell you that when I look at overall Consulting margins, I'm quite satisfied. And for us, the exchange is a growth opportunity rather than an earnings opportunity at this stage. Do you have any other question, Josh?
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. So for those new – I'm just surprised, I guess; not that it has to be significant – but of those new customers coming on aren't creating additional high-revenue margin, ultimately. It's always – the P&L – we've been over this about two years, I guess. The P&L seems in miss years (37:45), it seems like you are adding customers, you've already invested in the systems, I guess. I'm just surprised – there doesn't have to be a big contribution – but I'm surprised it would be a flat-to-negative contributor on profitability, I guess, at this point.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I would say a couple things to look at that. One, January 1 is the renewal date for the 2016 plans, and so, the statistics that Mercer released in their press release in October relate to 2016 and not to 2015. And also, this is a build-mode. This is about acquiring clients, marketing well, serving clients well, being able to handle large amounts of incoming. And so it's not just-in-time inventory of people and capabilities. I mean, that will be more how it operates several years down the road. But right now, this is a build, not a just add on. Next question, please.
Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thank you. And first, congratulations to both Mike and Mark. My first question is on the foreign exchange impact. It looks like it's bigger than you anticipated at the beginning of the year. If currencies stay the same as today, do you see currency also a meaningful headwind for you to return to your 13% EPS long-term goal in 2016?
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. No. So Kai, when we look over periods of time, like 10 years or 20 years, within the company, foreign exchange has been a wash. And when we look at Marsh & McLennan and our footprint around the world, we are very much a global business and so foreign exchange is a part of our reported results. And we've got to wear foreign exchange. I think when you look back over the last few years, we were wearing $0.03, $0.04 per year of foreign exchange headwind and we didn't whine about it. We delivered 13%-plus EPS growth while wearing that kind of headwind. This year is remarkable. I mean, the spike of the strengthening dollar in this year really caught everyone by surprise and was shocking in its ascent. So in terms of this year, there was just no way to operate the company in a proper way without pulling back expense levers, incorrectly, I would say. But as we look forward, if we look at next year, if we return to the regular $0.03 or $0.04, $0.05 kind of headwind that we've had in past years, it shouldn't disrupt our ability to get back to our strong levels of EPS growth that we've been used to. I would just add for this year, it's about a six points of EPS growth has been lost to foreign exchange and so the delivery of 8% year-to-date on EPS growth is, in my view, a remarkable achievement for the company. Do you have anything else, Kai?
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Second question on capital management, looks like you're already exceeding your $2.3 billion total capital management in 2014. You mentioned that you're going to basically third quarter, pulling forward fourth quarter and first quarter of next year buybacks. I just wonder are we going to see a meaningful decrease in buybacks and overall, if you think about your total capacity for capital returns, is the $2.3 billion still a runway annual number or you still has some excess cash capacity including debt as well as excess cash position that could be on top of that?
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So as we outlined on Investor Day, we anticipated that we were going to be returning higher levels of capital to shareholders because we knew that we would have higher cash flows from operations, we were reducing cash on the balance sheet and we had declining calls on our cash and we also intended to increase our leverage while remaining prudent. And right now, our corporate debt to EBITDA is around 1.6 times, so I would say it's well within the level that we're comfortable with. And so this year, for a variety of different reasons – acquisitions have run at least on a year-to-date basis a little bit higher than what we had been doing the past couple of years and last year was a pretty big year as well. And so, doing $2.4 billion through nine months with the anticipation of our transaction with Jelf which is already announced and should happen within the next two to three months, combined with the idea that we pay out our bonuses in the first quarter and so we tend to be more cash light in the first quarter than in other quarters, I would say that you will see less share buyback certainly in the fourth quarter and most likely in the first quarter as well than what we've done this year. And when I look forward to next year, I think that 2016 probably looks a little bit more like 2014 – $2.3 billion kind of number sounds about right for return of capital to shareholders.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you so much.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Next question, please.
Operator: Larry Greenberg, Janney.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Capital Markets: Thank you, and good morning. Just wondering if Alex could comment a little bit on the reinsurance market? Some have pointed to a reduction in third party capital this year into this sector and just the absolute level of prices in certain segments of the reinsurance business is maybe signaling that at least things aren't getting as bad on the margin and maybe we're about to trough out on where things are?
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Alex, you want to take that?
Alexander Moczarski - Chairman; President and Chief Executive Officer, Guy Carpenter & Company LLC, Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure. So we calculate that is now about dedicated reinsurance capital of $400 billion, of which $66 billion is collateralized and $334 billion is rated. So more or less, $66 billion or $60 billion of alternative capital that's come into the marketplace and clearly, it's had its effect on rates and also on terms and conditions as the traditional reinsurers have tried to maintain market share. Do we feel that it's troughing out? We certainly are seeing some signs – I wouldn't call hardening – I'd say less softening than we've seen in the past. Frankly, the collateralized products and traditional reinsurance products are pretty much at the same price right now, sort of competing at the bottom, perhaps. So, there are signs that it's harder to place business than it was a year ago, but those are very, very pale signs.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In a lot of ways, Larry, it's tougher to be a reinsurance capital provider than a reinsurance broker. Because for us, it's not about the premium per se, it's about the value we create; and in tough environmental markets like this, companies want and need advice and we're there to provide innovative solutions to help them cope with these difficult market conditions.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Capital Markets: Great. Thank you. And I, too, want to congratulate Mike on just an outstanding career and best wishes in the future.
J. Michael Bischoff - Chief Financial Officer: Ah, thanks, Larry.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Next question, please.
Operator: Sarah DeWitt, JPMorgan.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: In the Consulting business, it's been a great story in terms of strong organic growth and margin expansion. Where do you think the margins in the Consulting business could head over time?
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it's a good question. I start with an easy answer – higher than they are today – as I'm looking at Julio and Scott because they're the ones who have to deliver it on the ground. But overall, our margin story in Consulting has been pretty consistent over the last several years. And when you look at Consulting overall as a division in 2012, they delivered 150 bps of growth; in 2013, 160 bps; in 2014, 160 bps, and year-to-date 90 bps. In a lot of ways, our focus is more on earnings and growing our net operating income and that's how we're geared as a company and focusing on our output. And margin in a lot of ways is one of those outputs. We have an approach in the company in both Consulting and in RIS that revenue growth should almost always exceed expense growth. And then when that doesn't happen, we want it to be our choice; so we're making specific investment decisions in a quarter or two – and we call that being upside-down – and whenever we're upside-down we expect to get right-side up in the very near future, and so we have a consistent approach. But when we look at the work that we've done throughout our Consulting division, in part, it is a focus on a mix of business issue which favors our higher margin parts of the business. But as I was saying earlier, we are investing actively in things like MMX and others which pull down the margin of the Consulting division, but we're making the right decisions about investing with today's money and today's earnings to drive better opportunities for us in the future. Do you have another question, Sarah?
Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes. Thanks. And then just circling back on the private health exchanges, how large does that business need to be in terms of lives before it becomes a contributor to earnings?
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't know if we even have that answer, but I'm going to hand over to Julio because I think maybe a broader discussion around exchanges are in order. And I say that I don't even know if we have the answer because I know I don't know the answer and I have not pressed the business for it because I think it's so premature. At the end of the day, our focus on the exchange is not earnings and hasn't been earnings over the last few years. And so we're in a terrific position to be able to build the business without the pressure of delivering earnings today. And so, I think the overall focus of the leadership team on the exchange business is making sure we're positioned to capture the full opportunity over a multi-year basis. But Julio, do you want to add to it a bit?
Julio A. Portalatin - President & Chief Executive Officer, Mercer LLC,: Yeah. Well, Dan, thank you. Mercer Marketplace is certainly an important contributor to our growth in the health business and will continue to be so for some time to come. We think that over time, it will continue to be the type of business we want to invest in, make sure that our clients have that option as we think through the strategies that they are thinking about for their benefits. And that's a very important distinction, right, because we are trusted advisors; strategy-first discussions with many of our clients take place all the time. And some have concluded that Mercer Marketplace is the right place for them to be able to maximize the desired outcome that they have for broader employee choice, a quality colleague experience, flexibility and savings. That continues to be the case and we will continue to invest because it will give us that kind of revenue uplift. And ultimately, it's what our clients want. If we end up with those discussions being this option, we want to be there for them. So as you know, in total, the exchange now serves over 700,000 employees and retirees, and with a projected exchange access for an anticipated 1.5 million lives. We're pretty pleased with that and we'll continue to invest.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I guess, just to round out the question on earnings and why we're not focused on earnings. Because in our overall size of company and overall earnings growth, it just doesn't matter. When something is not contributing to earnings, the first year it does, it contributes to earnings. So what's that number look like? And then the year after that, let's say it doubles its earnings for a couple years in a row. It's still relative to our overall size of Mercer, let alone the size of Marsh & McLennan Companies, just not big enough to get the level of attention on earnings that it may generate. But next question, please?
Operator: Vinay Misquith at Sterne Agee.
Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT: Hi, good morning. The first question is on margins and the RIS segment. Those expanded about 130 basis points year-to-date this year. Curious about how much you can expand margins when the organic growth slows to the 2% to 3% range, given that we're at pretty high margins right now?
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. No, it's a fair question. And I would say that when we look at the company overall, we're pretty satisfied with our margins. But again, we have a discipline about growing our revenue faster than growing our expenses, and so we will consistently see margin expansion going out into the future. It has not been a one or two or three year story in RIS with regard to margins. We are in the eighth consecutive year of margin expansion in RIS. And just as a reminder, even though we were talking about margins in 2011 and 2012 about, can you grow margins any more, you've come so far since 2008? We grew RIS margins 120 bps in 2012, 150 bps in 2013, 30 bps last year, we're at 130 bps year-to-date. So we have demonstrated an ability over a long period of time of growing margins. And where we sit today, and obviously we don't control all the macro factors, but we feel pretty comfortable that we will be able to expand margins into the future. And certainly, when we look at 2016 we would expect to see margin expansion in both segments. But as we've said before, margins are one of the last things we look about. We think about our organic growth, our level of organic investment to build a better company and support future levels of organic growth. We look at our earnings and whether we're growing NOI and delivering value for our clients and shareholders on that score. And then we look at margins; and margins to us is more of an outcome than anything else. We would gladly give up a bit of margin for faster levels of organic growth and when we see those opportunities, we'll take those opportunities.
Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. Thank you. And the second question is around the debt. You mentioned that you pulled forward some debt issuance from next year, but your debt to EBITDA is only 1.6x. Are you planning on raising more debt next year and keeping the leverage ratio the same next year versus this year?
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I'll hand it to Mike in a second, but I would say yes, we're at 1.6 but we were at 1.1. So ultimately in the last – well, if I just look at it from year-to-date last year, how we finished the year – ultimately when we think about debt we've got $1.1 billion of more debt than we had at year-end of 2014 and $600 million less of cash. So we obviously are flexing in different ways. And we've had levels of corporate debt to EBITDA over the last 25 years everywhere from say a one, two or three or three-and-a-quarter, and within that range we would be comfortable, depending on what factors were existing at that point in time. So I wouldn't say that we're targeting 1.6 or any other corporate debt to EBITDA at this point in time. We maintain a prudent approach. And what I could say is that it would be unlikely that we would create more leverage only to buy back more shares but certainly other opportunities, both organic and acquisition-related, would be more likely that that would generate more leverage. But, Mike, you want to add to that?
J. Michael Bischoff - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, Dan, what I'll say – I would just add a few things. We always look for balance on everything, and so it's a balance with regard to leverage, with regard to the growth opportunities we see. But we don't begin by looking at it as just at leverage. We look at the operating cash flows and the growth of the company, and then we think, okay, what's a normalized level of debt to accompany the growth that we're looking at and those very strong operating cash flows? But the other thing we look at is really, what is our refinancing risk and what's our liquidity? And as I indicated in my remarks, we've spent really, the better part of three-and-a-half years reshaping our debt maturity ladder so that we do not have any major towers coming against us in any one year, and in fact, over the next four or five years, we have very small amounts of debt coming due. And so we've created a situation where the debt maturity ladder is very nice, which gives us a little bit more flexibility if an opportunity presents itself. The other thing I would say is I kind of look at it as an interest expense budget, so to speak, and that's why we also talked about, at $3 billion of debt a number of years ago, our interest expense on an annual basis was about $200 million. You look at the $4.5 billion today, and it's actually less than $170 million, but if you throw in the cost of commercial paper and the revolver, that's why I said it's in the neighborhood of $170 million to $175 million. So we look at it many different ways, not just leverage, but we think we have a lot of flexibility and if an opportunity presents itself in the future, as Dan indicated, we can take advantage of it.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Next question, operator?
Operator: Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.
Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, good morning. I just had one quick question first on the private healthcare exchanges. I was wondering if you can break down the enrollment between those that chose the self- versus the fully-insured option. And I guess how does that compare to what you saw last year as well as your expectations?
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, thanks. Julio, do you want to take that?
Julio A. Portalatin - President & Chief Executive Officer, Mercer LLC,: Sure. Thank you for the question. In the fully insured and self-insured, we're really not seeing people make conscious decisions to change from what they have traditionally already been implementing. So if they were fully insured before, they tend to stay fully insured, and if they're self-insured, they tend to stay self-insured. So as an example, I will show you that based on the clientele that we accumulated in our first year of 2014, it was 75% fully insured/25% self-insured and in 2015 it was 60% fully insured and 40% self-insured, and in 2016 it's about the same: 57% fully insured and 43% self-insured.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thank you. I think we have time for one more question, operator.
Operator: Charles Sebaski, BMO Capital Markets.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the Marsh Agency business and how that has been a contributor to the margin expansion there and whether or not given the size, being as you said $900 million in revenue now, that we might be able to get to see that as a separate broken out line item, given that $900 million kind of falls in the size of your other discrete line item businesses. Thanks.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Charles, I'm glad you got the last question because I had all the series of exchange questions for Julio and meanwhile we've got this $900 million business that we've invested in for the last seven years, but Peter, do you want to take that and talk a little bit about the Agency?
Peter Zaffino - Chairman - Risk & Insurance Services and President & Chief Executive Officer - Marsh, LLC, Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.: Sure, and in terms of its contribution to margin, as Dan mentioned in his opening comments, we're wearing the amortization for the acquisition. So while it is a contributor, that is certainly going to be a headwind for the short run. The revenue that we had mentioned on $900 million is the estimated annualized as we hit into next year, so that's not what is actually being earned this year. But if I step back, Marsh & McLennan Agency is hitting on all cylinders. We have acquired the highest quality agencies across the United States, now created substantial hubs within California and Texas. Our pipeline is as strong as it's been for spokes and fold-ins, so we'll be able to expand our business and be more dense in areas that we want to expand. And its organic growth engine has been terrific this year and it's been very balanced. We've had growth within property and casualty and employee health and benefits and believe that will continue. So overall, incredibly pleased with what we've acquired, what we're building, how they're coming together as a leadership team and we're very optimistic for the future.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): How does pricing compare this year on – the pipeline you said is very strong – on what's going on relative to last year? It seems to be a very competitive market in that business.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I would say overall, I don't think it's very much different this year to last year, it is a competitive market, but I would say the difference is really when you look back four or five years ago, the multiples were lower than they are today, so it's very important for us to understand that. One of our focuses is on quality and history of good performance and stability of the leadership team, the chemistry, all of those other factors become more important as we evaluate agencies versus each other and determine which ones should be a part of Marsh & McLennan Agency. It's also very important for us to really come to an understanding of what the EBITDA really is. That may be even more important than multiple because these are largely all private companies, and so there is a pro forma aspect of figuring out what EBITDA is, and it takes some skill in determining what is ongoing EBITDA. And so, I think there may be some players out there that might get the multiple right but they get the EBITDA wrong. We want to be right on both the EBITDA and the multiple.
Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But I think that just about does it. We've passed our one hour commitment. And I'd like everyone for joining us this morning. I'd particularly like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. I hope everyone has a very good day and let's go, Mets.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Second Quarter 2015 Financial Results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events and results which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's most recent SEC filings, which are available on the MMC website for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Dan Glaser: Thank you, Serra, and good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. I am Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO; and our operating companies' CEOs, Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter, Julio Portalatin of Mercer, and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh of Investor Relations. Now, Mike is fighting a bad cold, so we are going to preserve his voice for the Q&A, so Keith will read his script following mine. Previously, we have talked about how volatility and complexity present unique opportunities for MMC to serve clients in the areas of risk, strategy and people. As we have throughout our history, we will continue to serve as a trusted adviser to our clients on the challenges and opportunities they faced in this dynamic environment. Another Marsh & McLennan constant is our continued commitment to our core principles. We exist to serve clients. If we do so effectively, we will achieve our revenue and profit objectives. Our success is driven by our ability to execute which is a core differentiator. We are always looking for the smarter way. We have a permanent dissatisfaction with this status quo, and we act with integrity and purpose in all that we do. Our continued commitment to these principles should rank us among elite global growth companies. In recent months, several high profile transactions have been announced in the insurance industry, including transactions involving trading partners and clients in the P&C and health insurance space, as well as potential combination involving two of our largest direct competitors. Let me share some observations on their potential impact. Amongst the host of other reasons, a prolonged period of low interest rates and benign loss activity has led to an environment, where pressure is likely to build on underwriting margins and ROEs for the P&C industry. This reality is even more acute on the reinsurance side of the business, where sharper price declines, alternative capital and higher levels of risk retention are all prevalent. The number of insurance industry transactions and their aggregate value has been significant. However, the insurance market is very deep and we do not expect these recent deals to alter the overall competitive landscape in any meaningful way. As an example, despite what seems like a lot of consolidation over the last decade, the number of U.S. P&C carriers has actually increased in the last 10 years to more than 1,100 today. Furthermore, the share of U.S. industry premiums written by the top 5% of carriers is virtually unchanged from a decade ago. We believe the impact of these combinations to MMC and our RIS segment will be modest. In our view, the role of Marsh is even more critical at a time of industry consolidation. Specifically for Guy Carpenter, the combination of a few large clients could lead them to buy less reinsurance; however, we expect this impact will be gradual and limited. Over the last several years, Guy Carpenter has been a market leader in a tough reinsurance environment, always innovating and finding ways to add value to clients by looking at the entirety of their risk profile. Guy Carpenter has achieved strong levels of new business, broadened the client base by focusing on underserved segments and expanded internationally. Despite the ongoing challenging environment, we will capitalize on our position as an employer of choice in the reinsurance industry and will continue to add talent and capabilities. Additionally, there have been a number of announced potential transactions among major providers of health insurance. These combinations may better equipped the national carriers to deal with the challenges they face on multiple fronts, such as achieving greater scale and becoming more efficient, expansion in their government programs, the rise of public and private exchanges and consolidation of the provider side of the business. We do not see this as having any meaningful negative impact on our market position. To the contrary, the proposed combinations of major health insurers makes Mercer's role more relevant as we seek to drive comprehensive plan, designs at competitive terms. Consolidation will cause our clients to have questions about how this impacts them. As a trusted advisor, there is no company better positioned than Mercer to help clients navigate their health and benefit options in this changing landscape. Lastly, we have recently seen the announcement of the potential merger of two direct competitors. I fundamentally believe that competition is good. We thrive on it and it makes us better. These firms are good competitors and we expect they will continue to be, if they come together. That said, this really is a potential combination of two separate and quite different businesses that have little overlap. This is not altering the competitive landscape for Marsh & McLennan Companies. Now, let us turn to our results. Given the broader operating environment, I am pleased with our results for the first half of the year. Over that period, adjusted EPS rose 6%. For the second quarter, underlying revenue was up 3% and adjusted EPS increased slightly to $0.80, reflecting the continued effect of macroeconomic headwinds on our earnings. For our Risk and Insurance Services segment, revenue was $1.8 billion with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income was $445 million and the adjusted operating margin was 25.4%. Through six months, adjusted operating income rose 4%, approaching $1 billion and the adjusted operating margin increased 160 basis points to 27.9%. At Marsh, revenue was $1.5 billion underlying growth was 3%. The U.S. and Canada division lead the way with underlying revenue growth of 4%, reflecting strong performance from our U.S. operations. Within the U.S. both, our core broking operation and Marsh & McLennan agency had very good performance. MMA continues to be a strong contributor to revenue growth. In June, we acquired Dallas-based MHBT, one of the nation's largest and highest quality independent insurance brokers. With revenue of $75 million, MHBT will serve as MMA's southwest regional hub. Also in July, MMA established its presence in Canada with the acquisition of Vézina, a leading Montréal-based firm. In our international division, underlying revenue growth was 2%, with 3% growth in EMEA, while Asia-Pacific was flat and Latin America grew 5%. Guy Carpenter's revenue of $275 million declined 2% on an underlying basis. The U.S. and Asia-Pacific were areas of strength. For the six-months, Guy Carpenter's underlying revenue was flat, a reasonable performance given reinsurance industry pressures. In May, we announced the strengthening of our of our RIS management team. Peter Zaffino became Chairman of the Risk and Insurance Services segment and will continue to serve as Marsh's CEO. Peter was CEO of Guy Carpenter for three years prior to becoming CEO of Marsh in 2011. His new strategic role is a natural evolution of his deep experience in the reinsurance industry as well as his knowledge of the primary markets. Peter Hearn will join Guy Carpenter as CEO next June. Peter has over 30 years of industry experience and is known for his successful track record of driving growth and innovative thinking in the reinsurance space. He will continue to strengthen Guy Carpenter's position as a premier provider of advice and solutions for clients. Alex has done an excellent job over the past four years as Guy Carpenter's CEO and will continue as CEO through May 2016. At that point his full attention will be on his role as Chairman of MMC International, which was a part-time focus since 2012. Alex is the ideal person to drive MMC's international growth agenda and will report directly to me. Moving to consulting, revenue was $1.5 billion in the second quarter, up 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income was $244 million and the adjusted operating margin increased to 16.4%. Through six months adjusted operating income rose 4% to $491 million and the adjusted operating margin increased 90 basis points to 16.9%. Mercer's versus revenue was $1 billion, an underlying increase of 4%. Revenue grew across major geographies, including continued solid performance in Europe, growth markets in the United States. All global businesses contributed led by investments at 8% with AUMs now reaching $136 billion. Talent grew 4%, its third consecutive quarter of growth. Retirement increased revenue by 2% and health rose 3%. Health in the U.S. continues to benefit from Mercer marketplace. This was partially offset by lower revenue in our health and benefits administration business as we execute our strategy to improve profitability. Mercer continued to broaden its offerings to clients this quarter, with product launches in executive compensation, pension risk exchange and wealth management. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the second quarter was $441 million, reflecting underlying revenue growth of 3%. We are pleased with Oliver Wyman's underlying growth of 5% for the six months as it builds on mid-teens growth last year. Revenue increases were achieved across all businesses with the exception of financial services, which were off slightly from its record level posted in the same period last year. In summary, despite substantial macro headwinds in the second quarter, we produced solid underlying revenue growth and EPS in line with our expectations. We expect strong EPS growth over the second half of the year. For the full-year, we expect to deliver underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both operating segments and high single-digit EPS growth. We will continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends and meaningful share repurchases. Additionally, we remain confident in our ability to grow EPS at 13% CAGR over the long-term. With that, let me turn it over to Keith.
Keith Walsh: Thank you, Dan, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter, Marsh & McLennan Companies delivered solid underlying revenue growth in both segments. GAAP EPS was $0.77 and adjusted EPS was $0.80, a slight increase from the second quarter of last year. As we have previously discussed, results this year are being impacted significantly like two macroeconomic headwinds, the declining global interest rates and the strength of the U.S. dollar. Based on current FX rates, we expect the macro headwinds to negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.32 this year, an increase from our earlier estimate of $0.30. The adverse impact in the first quarter was $0.12. In the second quarter, it was $0.07 and we expect $0.07 in the third quarter and $0.06 in the fourth quarter. In this quarter, the headwinds had a greater impact on Risk and Insurance Services than Consulting. We expect the impact will be greater on the Consulting segment in the third and fourth quarters. Due to the timing of the headwinds and the mitigation action taken in the first quarter, we believe you get a clear picture of our earnings growth and margin improvement by viewing our results on a year-to-date basis. Through the first six months of the year, adjusted operating income increased 4% to $1.4 billion. The adjusted operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 21.6% and adjusted EPS increased 6% to a $1.70. As Dan just discussed, we expect strong EPS growth in the second half of this year. Investment income was $3 million in the second quarter, an increase of $5 million from a year ago. We recently have been advised that Trident III is harvesting its final two investments. If this occurs in the third quarter, we should recognize investment income similar to the $26 million of investment income in last year's third quarter. Total debt was $3.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, including $50 million of commercial paper outstanding. Throughout the year, we have utilized the commercial paper market, which provides us with short-term liquidity and gives us greater cash management flexibility. The next debt maturity is a $50 million term loan, due in March of 2016. Our GAAP tax rate was 27.9% in the second quarter compared with 27.6% in the second quarter of last year. This quarter, we benefited from New York City Tax Reform, which was enacted in April. The tax rate can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, reflecting our geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years and the impact of changes in international and state tax rates. However, for modeling purposes, based on the current landscape, it would be reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29.5% in the second half of this year and 29% for 2016. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders. In May, the Board of Directors renewed a $2 billion share repurchase program. The board also increased the quarterly dividend 11% to $0.31 per share effective with the third quarter payment. Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $930 million with approximately $155 million in the U.S. Uses of cash in the second quarter included $151 million for dividends, $260 million for acquisitions and $475 million to repurchase 8.2 million shares of stock. Through six months, uses of cash included $302 million for dividends, $400 million for acquisitions and investments and $775 million to repurchase 13.5 million shares of stock. Our share count has now declined five straight quarters and is down almost 3% versus the prior year. We remain on track to exceed the $2.3 billion we used last year for share repurchase, dividends and acquisitions. With that I am happy to turn it back to Dan.
Dan Glaser: Thanks Keith, and well done. Operator, we are ready for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] first question from Dan Farrell, Piper Jaffray.
Dan Farrell: Thank you and good morning. A question on your tax rate comments, you mentioned I think 29.5% for back half of the year and I think you said 29% in '1, so we are seeing a little incremental decline in sort of the guidance that you put towards that. I am wondering what is driving that and I am wondering longer-term if you see any opportunities or ways to trying and gradually manage the tax rate down going forward. Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Thanks Dan. I mean, clearly we have made certain commitments to looking at our global tax position over time and we have invested in a new Head of Global Tax, Dina Shapiro who started with us recently. Now, it is too early for Dina to have a real impact on moving our tax rate down, but this has been a focus of the company for the last couple of years. I mean, clearly when we look at our competitors, we are at a disadvantage by being a U.S. multi-national vis-à-vis what tax rate we have versus most of our competitors, so we have to operate the business better. We have to grow faster and we have to have better operating earnings to drive higher pre-tax to arrive at is similar levels on an after-tax basis, so we have been doing that. The search for tax efficiency for us started several years ago and we are beginning to see some of the benefits from that, but let me hand it over to mike and test that throat of his to see if he has got anything to add.
Mike Bischoff: Yes. Thank you, Dan. You are absolutely right. We are at a disadvantage as an American company, because of the high federal and then state tax rates, but also the issue of any of the international cash that we want to repatriate into the United States has a federal true-up to 35% rate. Over the last three years, we have really dedicated it a significant amount of resources tax planning and strategies to be able to effectively repatriate cash into the U.S. in a tax efficient manner. Now that we feel that that is fairly well settled, we can then pivot and turn more of our energies into other opportunities that we may see around the world. As Dan indicated, we have put additional resources into our tax group, particularly in the international tax planning. When you look at that with regard to where the tax rates on a global basis, for example, the U.K. continues to reduce its corporate tax. As we indicated in our scripts, New York State a year ago and then followed by New York City effective in April of this year reduced their tax rate, so when we look at everything across the year, we feel that our tax rate for the second half of the year most likely will fall in the 29.5%, but because of all of these strategies and where we think we see some additional opportunities, it should be 29% as the base rate going forward.
Dan Farrell: Okay. Great. Then one other quick question if I can. In the Risk and Insurance Services, you mentioned, I think that a lot of the currency headwind was there yet the margins looked like they held up fairly well, which would imply, I think some nice, underlying margin growth even though the organic was only moderate. I am wondering what you see driving that margin growth. Are you still seeing some expense efficiencies and how do you think about that as we move forward? Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Sure. In terms of business performance, our main objective is to drive revenue and earnings growth. Secondary objective of ours is to improve our margins in both segments and we view that really as a natural outcome of growing revenues faster than expenses almost all the time. Now, periodically, we are going to grow expenses faster than revenue for opportunistic reasons, but we are very careful on that and it would not last for very long. When we look at RIS and Consulting margins, we think it is best to look at year-to-date and really a full-year basis, because mitigation against some of the headwinds we were facing felt so heavily in the first quarter, you really have to look over a longer period of time for this year, so we do expect to have margin expansion in both segments this year.
Dan Farrell: Thank you very much.
Dan Glaser: Thanks. Sure. Next question please?
Operator: Larry Greenberg, Janney Capital.
Larry Greenberg: Hey, good morning. Just staying on that subject, can you give us what the underlying margin change was in the second quarter adjusted for the headwinds? I think you gave that number in the first.
Keith Walsh: Well, I think I would start by saying if you look specifically at, say, RIS, the overall margin in the second quarter for the company was flat at 19.9%, but year-to-date for the whole company is 21.6%, so it is up 120 bps on a year-to-date basis. As I was just saying to Dan, I think you might get the wrong kind of outcomes if you look in two shorter periods for this year, because the mitigation in the first quarter really does have an overextended effect on where margins are. Even if I broke down the margins for you, we were reluctant to in the first quarter, because as you remember in the 100s of basis point improvement on margins, which is really did not jive with the level of growth we were having on the top-line. Even though it looks more reasonable on a year-to-date basis and the margin increases come down a bit, so it is more credible in terms of overall performance. It is still not the most accurate of pictures, so all I could say is, be patient and bear with us. As we go through the year, you will see the more active margin improvement. If I give you a little bit more than that, it would just be, we look at this year not that too similarly to how we look at last year in terms of overall company performance on margins. Maybe a little bit better, maybe a little bit worse, but we are kind of in the same ball game and as we had said before, Consulting, we expect to come off the very large pace of 150-basis point, 160-basis point annual margin improvement and we expected RIS to actually improve a little bit from last year our margin, so that is about as much color as I think it is credible at this point in time.
Larry Greenberg: Okay. That is fair. I mean, it would be helpful to us, I think, just kind of back test the numbers we are using in our models, but certainly I understand the point. Then I think Dan you mentioned that you had a bit slower growth in health at Mercer and you are changing some things to improve profitability. Just wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit?
Dan Glaser: Sure. Julio, you want to take that?
Julio Portalatin: Sure. Thank you, Larry. Health remains a pretty profitable and growing business for Mercer. It will continue to be there as time goes on. As I discussed in the last call, we decided a few years ago to incorporate our benefit admin business into our line of businesses just to remind you of that action that we took. In this particular case health and benefits administration business or outsourcing was actually incorporated to our health segment. When we did that, the results have been pretty positive, because of course now we have a PNL Manager, managing the full breadth of the business that is necessary to deliver our solutions and of course attention is being given to both, top-line opportunity as well as bottom-line opportunity. Part of those decisions had to do with of course on the bottom-line improvement, our client and retention of some of the businesses that perhaps over time had just not been able to meet the margin and profitability targets of our business. Because of that, you take all these elements into the impact, Mercer marketplace impact of course of revenue growth, core H&B, revenue growth and then you take the impact of the good actions that we are taking to improve profitability administration. You basically have similar type of growth patterns that you have had traditionally with the health business.
Operator: We will go next to Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan: Thank you. Good morning. First question, Dan, thank you for the extensive remark on the industry consolidation, a just follow up on that and for Marsh specifically, what you think Marsh will play a role in this industry consolidation? Do you see either organic or inorganic opportunities?
Dan Glaser: I will start with that and then I will handover to Peter for more commentary. Let me address inorganic first, because I do not really think that that would be spurred in any way by the insurance company level consolidation you have seen. When we consider Marsh, Marsh has an active pipeline of acquisition opportunities. They work that pipeline over generally a number of years in developing relationships with companies in the RIS space, so you know I would say it is mainly focused on organic. Our view is that Marsh as a trusted advisor is an incredibly valuable resource to clients and it is on the client side of the table. It is not a seller of insurance, but actually operates as assisting clients analyze their risk profile and as a buyer of insurance once the design and placement structures are agreed on with the client. When we look what we look at the consolidation in the business overall on the insurance company side, you know, it will be taking larger world-class kind of firms in many instances and putting them together. over the long-term, we really expect that to have additional value for our clients in terms of broader product, new product, better financial kind of stability the industry overall, so you know it is sort of is consistent with the way many of our clients, particularly our largest clients think about the business where they want to have fewer deeper, more strategic relationships with fewer capital providers, but Peter, you want to have to that?
Peter Zaffino: Yes. What I would Dan is, just that as you mentioned being advocates of clients is making sure that we are working closely with the insurance companies in the consolidation on strategy, how they intend to integrate the organizations and how that affects risk appetite. There could be some overlap today on signings, so how do we manage through that. Also, there could be specific geographies whether overweigh, under weigh underway and making sure that we are giving our clients real-time advice on how they interact with the companies after consolidation. That is great. Just a follow-up on the capital management side, it looks like the pace of the buyback has been faster than last year. You understand the full-year of buyback amount in the first half. I just wondered will the pace be sustained and what is source of funding for the buyback, do you need to increase your leverage to fund the buybacks. Thanks.
Dan Glaser: Sure. Let me start with that and then I will hand over to Mike if I leave him any room, because he is well drilled me over the past couple of years in how we think about capital management in general, but as we outlined on Investor Day, we expected to have higher levels of cash all to be deployed on a go forward basis and that was generally from three factors, higher free cash flow owing to our string of strong operating results and our improving operating performance, declining calls on our cash and also optimizing our balance sheet and we explained how over time we expected to reduce the cash on our balance sheet and also grow our leverage over time. We have been doing that and it is a very balanced strategy so when we think about after reinvesting in our people and our existing businesses, there is basically three ways that we deploy our cash, M&A, dividends and share repurchase. M&A, as we have said before can be lumpy. We do not have a budget around M&A, we talked to a lot of people, but we do not do many deals, so from that standpoint we have done about $400 million of M&A through the first two quarters of this year, which is similar to the pace that we had last year, but I could not tell you what the back half of the year is going to look like. What I can say is, the pipeline looks about like it did over the last several years, not much higher, not much lower, but the conversations are kind of continuing. Then you look at dividends, we are very happy that we recently raised our dividend 11%. That is our second consecutive year of double-digit increases and that is one of the commitments we made at Investor Day. Also what we said at Investor Day is that we intended to shrink our share count every year, so we are very happy that this is our 13th straight quarter of buyback and the fixed-rate quarter that we have actually reduced our share count, so that story continues. What I could not say is whether we were going to keep the same pace of what we had in the first half of the year going out into the future, not only in the back half, but also beyond. What I can say is that we will remain active in share repurchase that we will repurchase a meaningful amount of shares and that we will do that virtually every quarter over the course of time. Mike, did I leave you any room?
Mike Bischoff: I have got to say a very comprehensive answer. I would only touch on two points that you already made Dan, on cash. We have worked through the last two years to get at our excess cash, we have been reducing that, we effectively reduced it and not just through the end of last year, but through the first six months of this year, which we obviously apply to share repurchase. The second point I would just make with regard to the question, with regard do we need any additional debt capacity or offerings over the second half of this year to reach the goals that we have set, the answer is no. We have been working over three years to re-craft our debt portfolio. We really do not have anything meaningful renewing until 2017, so by reducing our cash and basically dealing with all the debts funding gives us an opportunity to manage our working capital needs with regard to commercial paper, which we are doing more this year. Now, having said we do not need to go to the capital markets this year, never say never. We do not know when opportunities will present themselves, but it is not a requirement.
Kai Pan: Thank you so much for all of the answers.
Dan Glaser: Okay. Thanks, Kai. Next question please.
Operator: Jay Gelb, Barclays.
Jay Gelb: Thank you. Good morning.
Dan Glaser: Good morning.
Jay Gelb: With regard to the Willis-Towers Watson transaction, my sense is typically that there is some level of dislocation of any two companies is going through a major merger. I am wondering if that offers Marsh or Mercer the opportunity to perhaps pick up additional business or perhaps.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Jay. We are not going to comment about Willis and Towers and that potential combination other than how it relates to us, so you know the way we view it is how it relates to us is basically, we are focused outside the shop in terms of growing our business, serving clients, getting new clients, expanding our business and recruiting people strategically. We are doing all of those things. When I think about our company overall, this is very much a people business. In my view not just in RIS, but across Marsh & McLennan Companies, we really are a talent magnet. We have a caliber of people that is quite high, smart, creative committed people. You know what we have found over time is smart, creative, committed people like working with smart, creative and committed people, so we are doing meaningful work for clients here, work that is interesting and it is impactful. I mean, you can pick up a newspaper any day and look at various articles in that newspaper and it is like Marsh & McLennan is all over those kind of issues and challenges that our clients are facing, so I also think we benefit frankly, particularly, in the RIS segment from a proven leadership team that is from the business, you know, that that grew up in the business, that understand the nuances of the business and I expected that that will reap benefits or Marsh & McLennan on the client side over a long stretch of time.
Jay Gelb: That is helpful. Thanks Dan. My separate question is on the third quarter boost from investment income. If that is $26 million pre-tax in the third quarter, I think that work starts around $0.03 to $0.04 a share after-tax. Was that inclusive of your initial of your view that EPS growth will be stronger in the back half and also the ability to get high single-digit EPS growth for the full-year or will that additional revenue, that $26 million, would that be essentially offset by reinvestments in the business. I am just trying to get a perspective of whether that investment income boost was taken into account in terms of your ability to generate the high single-digit EPS growth this year.
Dan Glaser: I think what you have to first do is look back at last year, because it is really not much of a boost. It is pretty consistent with the investment income that we earned in the third quarter of 2014. From that standpoint, it does not really do much for our EPS growth when compared to last year, because if we did not have it then it would be an additional headwind that we would have to make up. In terms of your question about do we need that to get to high single-digit, it is kind of too early for us to tell. I am glad we have it, but ultimately we feel very comfortable with kind of the high single-digit basis of how we expect to achieve the year, but Mike you have got something to add?
Mike Bischoff: Yes. The one thing I would add, and Jay, a very good question with regard to headwinds. As we indicated in our scripts, the headwinds now that we are facing for the totality of the year has been from $0.30 to $0.32, but actually in the second half of the year it increases by $0.03, so you can also hear from our statements that we have not backed away from any of the earlier guidance that we gave with regard to how we think the year looks in the second half of the year, so that basically says that we can absorb an additional $0.03 of headwinds. By the way, with regard to the amount of investment income coming in the quarter you said could it be $0.03 or $0.04. I think, it is more like $0.03.
Jay Gelb: I appreciate that Mike. It is probably worth noting as well that that FX headwind this year is probably a 10% headwind to EPS growth, right?
Dan Glaser: Yes. If you look at EPS on year-to-date basis, we have grown 6%, but if you looked on a constant currency basis, we would be 12% or 13%. If you factor that in terms of our view of being able to grow in the high single-digit on a constant currency, that would put you in that 13%, 14% area on a constant currency EPS growth.
Jay Gelb: Make sense. Thank you.
Dan Glaser: Okay. Next question please.
Operator: Sarah DeWitt, JPMorgan.
Sarah DeWitt: Hi. Good morning.
Dan Glaser: Good morning.
Sarah DeWitt: On Guy Carpenter, could you talk about what drove the decline in organic growth this quarter? Given the challenging reinsurance market condition, do you think you can still grow organically in this business going forward in the near-term to medium-term?
Dan Glaser: Sure. Alex, you want to take that?
Alex Moczarski: I have stated in the last call that we thought that the second quarter will be clunky and difficult. I would kind of look at the year-to-date and they say that we are flat. I still believe that we will finish flattish for the year. Luckily, know we have been working on diversifying our portfolio for quite a while now through segmentation by client size, by an appetite also through product, so we have a pretty robust portfolio spread across different geographies as well as through different client type. I am still optimistic that it is a good business and we are the employer of choice. We have a list of people who want to come and join us. We have had some good wins recently, the pipeline looks good going forward. Also I take comfort from the fact that the U.S. is showing good results. I am cautiously confidence that we will be in good shape.
Dan Glaser: Thanks. Sarah any other question?
Sarah DeWitt: No. Thank you for the answer.
Dan Glaser: Okay. Thank You. Next question operator.
Operator: Josh Shanker, Deutsche Bank
Josh Shanker: Yes. Good morning everyone. I am wondering if we can talk a little about the next year outlook Oliver Wyman and where are you seeing growth and where you are seeing some maybe moderation?
Dan Glaser: Okay. Let me just make one comment before I hand it over to Scott, because I am actually very pleased with Oliver Wyman's growth performance this quarter. When you think about whether it is coming on top of last year. I mean, in the second quarter, they grew 3%. They grew 17% in the second quarter of 2014, so it is showing quite a bit of strength in Oliver Wyman, but Scott you want to talk a little bit about the outlook?
Scott McDonald: Sure. Josh, we are very happy with the business at the moment. We think over the medium-term, we are still targeting mid to high single-digit growth. We think all the fundamentals are in place and we are in a competitively good position. We also think we should grow faster than MMC overall. Given we are smaller we should be able to take market share more easily. I think for 2015 overall given that we are growing off the back of the strong mid-teens growth from last year, it could be a little lower than that guidance, but the first half has been good at 5% and we see good prospects in the second half.
Dan Glaser: Any other question, Josh?
Josh Shanker: Is there a line of business that you can indulge us with a little bit? I mean, how banking is doing and what not?
Dan Glaser: Sure. The first half of the year was pretty much strong across all sectors, with a couple of exceptions and therefore different reasons. Energy was slow for obvious reasons. That industry is just under pressure. Telecommunications was slow for similar although not quite as intent reasons and RFS business was slightly slower, but it grew at more than 20% last year, so they are just struggling to grow off the back that is still a fundamentally very strong business. Then regionally, I mean the U.S. and our international markets, so all of Asia, Middle East, Latin America are very strong and Europe is the one part of the portfolio which is a little weaker compared to the last year although we are already seeing some signs of that picking up.
Josh Shanker: Excellent, and I wonder if we can sort of do the same sort of postmortem on a little bit of turbulence around Asia Pacific in the RIS segment.
Dan Glaser: Sure. I think you are referring to Marsh within the segment, because...
Josh Shanker: Yes. Marsh.
Dan Glaser: Because they are actually Guy Carpenter did reasonably well in Asia-Pac in the quarter, but Peter, you want to give some color on Marsh?
Peter Zaffino: Yes. Sure. Asia Pacific, we were not pleased with the flat growth. Within the region Pacific was more responsible for that than Asia. When I look at Pacific, its economic slowdown, some lower new business, lower construction, some pressure on pricing contributed to the results in the quarter. Asia, the underlying fundamentals are still strong. I mean, they had a very tough comparable year-over-year with having 15% organic growth in the second quarter 2014. That was coupled with about 600 basis points of non-recurring business that was a delta in new business year-over-year, so they had a real challenge and they still grew up. Overall, the margins are still strong in the region and I expect to have better performance if you look at the full-year and Asia-Pac is still a meaningful contributor to overall Marsh.
Josh Shanker: I do not mean to beat the dead horse, in trying to think about things, is 1Q or 2Q or maybe first half of 2015 totality is more indicative how we should think about things going forward?
Dan Glaser: Yes. I think, when you look at the company in RIS specifically, we still very much live in the 3% to 5% organic growth world. Just a couple of reminders on the history of our performance, if you look back at, say, 2012, RIS grew 7% in the first quarter followed by a 6, 4 and 2 in the fourth quarter and I am sure it seemed to everybody like the world was coming to an end. Then in the next nine quarters were 3% or better. I do not think you can look at one quarter in this business as being indicative of what a trend looks like and we are comfortable going forward. Clearly, we are adding another headwind that we did not have, so in terms of property and casualty pricing is under even more pressure than it was before. In an overall sense, that in some ways will get at least partially offset by better economic outlooks in many parts of the world other than, say, the commodity types of countries that Peter was referring to like Australia and Canada as examples, but Peter do you have anything to add?
Peter Zaffino: Yes. I just would suggest when we look at international, we should look at the full-year heavily dominated by Continental Europe in the first quarter, and we had some anomalies in the second, so I think you have a much more accurate picture of what the growth rate is going to be if we look at the full-year.
Dan Glaser: The next question please?
Operator: Ryan Tunis, Credit Suisse.
Ryan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess, my first question is just more follow-up on the broker M&A. Two of your biggest competitors in the consulting side are now operating or will be operating at a lower tax rate and the recent merger Willis and Towers appears to at least have been partially motivated by tax. Why should we not think of your higher tax rate as a competitive disadvantage in the consulting business?
Peter Zaffino: I think, when you first look at it, you have to look at it in overall company's profile and what its advantages are and what its disadvantages are. One thing is, in our review we would not change our strategic positioning with any other company in our space, even with their tax advantage, so we have to do things in our business to make up for the fact that U.S. companies operate at a tax disadvantage relative to the rest of the world. Now, I take with a glimmer of hope the fact that if New York state and New York City can actually change the tax rate anything is possible in the future, but ultimately it is something that we operate our business at a high performance level, we will continue to do that, we will not use the tax disadvantage that we have in certain areas as any kind of caveat or excuse to our performance. We will continue to perform well in the marketplace over a long period of time and we certainly do not feel disadvantaged vis-à-vis any of our competitors.
Ryan Tunis: That is helpful. Then I guess my follow-up was just on health organic. I guess this is the second quarter where there has been a little bit of a drag I guess from benefit admin. That has made you guys come in a little bit below core. I am wondering how long we should expect that to put pressure on that reported organic number of it is just sort of 2015-type event or this is a longer process?
Dan Glaser: Julio, do want to take that?
Julio Portalatin: Yes. Sure. Thank you for the question. As you know when you make decisions that are associated with especially the ben admin business, it does have some quarters before it runs itself through completely right? I would think if you look at the underlying growth that should be of big attention for folks like yourself and others. Again, if you back out the ben admin impact, the underlying core growth of our business continues to be very healthy as expected similar to previous years. You are likely to see these types of impact again can quarter-by-quarter as time goes, because you make the right decisions as far as keeping your focus on both, top-line and bottom-line, so we will see how it goes as we continue to make those decisions with clients. Remember that clients come up for renewal and we have conversations. Generally speaking, we land in a good place, where both of us see it as a win-win. In some cases, we do not, so it is not as predictable as you would like it to be.
Ryan Tunis: Thanks so much.
Dan Glaser: Next question please?
Operator: Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Good morning.
Dan Glaser: Good morning.
Elyse Greenspan: Just quickly on the headwind of $0.07 that you pointed to in the Q2. Is there any way that we can get the impact between both, currency and pension as well as just the impact on each of the two segments?
Dan Glaser: Mike, you want to take that?
Mike Bischoff: Yes. Roughly it works out to about $60 million of NOI headwinds. Within that, it would be a little bit higher in FX and a little bit lower on the average in the net retirement plans.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Then in terms of the breakdown between RIS and Consulting?
Mike Bischoff: Like we said on the script, the overall impact in the second quarter was felt more in RIS than it was in consulting. With regard to the magnitude, I would say within $5 million, $7 million between the two segments, but then we expect that to flip for the second half of the year. Consulting, we really feel more, the broader the headwinds, which is another reason why Dan continues to say that the margins and the growth, in the different segment are better when you look at how we deal with these headwinds year-to-date. As the management team, we are cognizant of these headwinds and we make management decisions throughout the year aware of that, so that is why we keep pointing people to the year-to-date.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you. Then in terms of Mercer Marketplace, as we had towards next year's enrollment season, just any update Julio that you can give on the conversations that you are having with companies surrounding moving over to your exchange. Then also, do you expect there to maybe be fallout and some opportunities associated with the merger that Towers Watson is going through? Thank you.
Julio Portalatin: You are welcome. Yes. I want to first just generally comment about the potential merger of our two competitors. First things, we know the firms pretty well. Of course, they are good competitors. From our perspective, we are going to continue to execute our strategy and our strategy is to stay focused on the things that already are working for us and even have more focus on the things that are beginning to pick up pace, things like Mercer Marketplace, our international expansion of global footprint, with our global clients and of course our investments business continues to do well and we continue to invest in those things. These are actions that we control of course. If anything, these things kind of just pinpoint your focus even that much more in terms of really being able to execute the pace and intensity. Having said that, a little bit on the exchanges, as you know we reported last in October about our exchange results and you are pretty familiar with those as it is. Some additional color that might be helpful to you is that, there is a lot of discussion around fully insured versus self-insured and we are seeing a trend that basically shows that there is more clients now going self-insured than we had seen in our first 60 or so clients that they went first to Mercer Marketplace as far as the DC DB distribution. About two-thirds of the DB, one-third is DC. As you know, we are still in the active season. Right now, we are moving more towards implementation, execution, delivering to our client, but there is also the off cycle opportunities that we have, especially in the middle market that we continue to work through. Our focus is to continue to sell the value proposition of Mercer Marketplace, continue to be able to increase our pipeline, talk to our clients about any concerns as they have especially as we think about the Cadillac tax coming up in 2018 or as I call the previous tax as I they really do believe that it affects much more than what people may believe. We believe that somewhere in the first in 2018, if nothing is done some, somewhere about 30% to 40% of clients may be able to Cadillac tax, so there is a lot of discussion going on there. Although Mercer Marketplace or exchanges are not the silver bullet to deal with the Cadillac tax, it certainly allows for flexibility for you to be able to implement certain actions against something like a Cadillac tax. Overall, we are pleased, pipeline is strong and we will continue to focus on delivering to our clients.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Elyse. Operator, I think, we have time for one or two more questions if we go reasonably rapidly so…
Operator: Brian Meredith, UBS.
Brian Meredith: Yes. Thanks. I just got a quick one here, Dan.
Dan Glaser: Okay.
Brian Meredith: On your Guy Carpenter and the reinsurance, just curious a couple of senior hires that you have made of late, obviously, Peter Hearn and a couple of others. Are those hires - because maybe you see kind of bottoming out here or in the reinsurance growth area, some demand picking up or is there some other reasons why you have decided to add talent at this point?
Dan Glaser: Well, I would start by saying no. We are not recruiting strategically, because we see a bottoming and reinsurance. We are recruiting strategically, because we can. I think this is a situation where we are committed to the reinsurance business, it is a tough environment right now, but in a lot of ways using our strength in that kind of environment to build our capabilities and our talent is opportunistic and we certainly are looking broadly. Even though with Peter Hearn, we hired from one competitor. It is not that we are just looking to add talent from a single competitor. We are actually doubling down in our reinsurance business and looking to add talent this year and next year as we invest through the cycle.
Brian Meredith: I am just curious, why now?
Dan Glaser: Yes. I think it is more opportunity than anything else. I mean, let me talk a little bit about our RIS structural changes. Then I think we can call it day from there, because I think it is all part and parcel of the way we view the market. I mean, to us the RIS world is changing. How much is secular and permanent and how much is cyclical is unclear, but what is clear is that we are in active period of consolidation, it is a softening market, there is certain of the larger insurance companies are retaining more risk, there has certainly been an increase in alternative capital and an increase in alternative has to capital. There has also been an increase in the facilities, program, specialty, placement and an increase in the increased need for analytics, so you put all of those things together and I do not think there is a company better positioned in the world than Marsh & McLennan to take advantage of that volatility and uncertainty that exists in the market. We are in a terrific position in terms of being able to invest despite some headwinds and we have no doubt that over time that turns around and some of those headwinds become tailwinds. We are very excited about our new structure in RIS. I think it gives us the opportunity to get specialist, whether it is placement specialist, program designed specialist, analytics perfect professionals collaborating more between Guy Carpenter and Marsh, they will help us promote growth, help us avoid cost duplication and it is certainly utilizes the talents of our executive team most effectively. For a whole variety of reasons, we view this as a good time to be an investor in this business. I will just end by saying that we are optimistic not only for the back half of this year, where we expect to have solid performance, but also as we look to next year, we have been working hard this year to make sure that if FX and interest rates are about where they are today that even though those headwinds would continue to exist, we take steps to improve our business and to have a good EPS performance next year, so we are quite optimistic where we sit today. With that I think it is time to end the call operator. I would just like to thank everyone for joining us this morning and specifically I would like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication and serving them. Have a good day.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. First quarter 2015 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They're available on the company's website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's most recent SEC filings, which are available on the MMC website for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO; and our operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter, Julio Portalatin of Mercer, and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh of Investor Relations. The business world is changing rapidly, and we continue to see examples of disruption and discontinuity. We believe Marsh & McLennan Companies is well positioned in this environment. We are global leaders in the areas of risk, strategy and people, and these areas all have great relevance to our clients. We are defined by deep specialization and united by a common purpose: doing meaningful work that makes a difference for our clients, colleagues and shareholders. We are industry innovators and thought leaders, proud of our heritage of advising clients on complex challenges. Many organizations ranging from multinationals to regionals and small firms, both public and private, are affected by issues such as heightened cybersecurity risk, political and economic uncertainty, increased regulation and slow economic growth. In this increasingly complex and dynamic world, the need for advice and services is rising. Our competitive positioning as a trusted adviser to our clients has never been stronger. Our proposition for shareholders remains unchanged. We are a global growth company with increasing capital flexibility. We continue to invest for future growth, and we have a proven leadership team known for keeping its commitments. I am pleased with our operating performance in the first quarter, especially considering global economic pressures and a softening P&C insurance market. We posted underlying revenue growth across all operating companies, margin improvement in both segments and strong growth in earnings per share. We continued to return capital to shareholders through dividends and meaningful share repurchases. Like other U.S. multinational companies, we are faced with challenges presented by the current global economic environment. In particular, we are weathering substantial headwinds from low interest rates and the strong U.S. dollar. As we discussed on our last conference call, our mitigation efforts primarily impact the first quarter, resulting in a net benefit to EPS of $0.03 in the quarter, and Mike will give you additional details. MMC's overall underlying revenue growth was 4% in the first quarter, and I am optimistic about our ability to continue to drive underlying revenue growth in both RIS and Consulting. Looking at our RIS segment. Revenue was $1.8 billion with underlying growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income increased 9% to $546 million. At March, revenue was $1.4 billion. Underlying growth was 3%, with all major geographic regions contributing. Strong new business drove the revenue increase. In the U.S./Canada division, underlying revenue growth was 3%, led by Marsh & McLennan Agency. The International division also expanded 3%. EMEA rose 2%. Asia-Pacific grew 5%, and Latin America increased 6%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $368 million, up 2% on an underlying basis. Growth in Global Specialties led the way, primarily marine and Lloyd's Property. In the Consulting segment, revenue was $1.4 billion, up 5% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income was $247 million, an increase of 9% from the prior year. Mercer's revenue was $1 billion, an underlying increase of 4%. The revenue increase was spread across all major geographic regions, including solid growth in Europe and growth markets. Good revenue performance was aided by the third consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying growth for investments at 13%. While Talent contributed 4%, Health was up 3% and Retirement was flat. In February, Mercer made a $75 million strategic equity investment in Benefitfocus, significantly expanding the relationship with Mercer Marketplace, our private health exchange. Together, we are driving innovation within the Health & Benefits industry. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the first quarter was $384 million, reflecting underlying growth of 8%. Revenue increases were achieved across all industry sectors. As expected, the rate of growth decelerated from the double-digit growth rate produced last year. In summary, even excluding the $0.03 net benefit from our mitigation efforts, we produced strong EPS growth and margin expansion in both segments. In 2015, we expect to deliver underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both operating segments and high-single-digit EPS growth. Additionally, we remain confident in our ability to grow EPS at a 13% CAGR over the long term. With that, let me turn it over to Mike.
J. Michael Bischoff: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered solid underlying revenue growth across each of our operating companies and double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share. Revenue growth exceeded the increase in underlying operating expenses for the 18th consecutive quarter. GAAP EPS rose 10% to $0.88, and adjusted EPS increased 12% to $0.91. As we discussed on last quarter's call, results this year are being impacted by 2 macroeconomic headwinds: the decline in global interest rates and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Consistent with our comments last quarter, our estimate is that higher retirement planned expenses and foreign exchange should impact earnings per share this year by approximately $0.30. The effects on our quarterly results will vary. In the first quarter, these macro headwinds impacted earnings by approximately $0.12. As anticipated, we made changes to our U.S. post-65 retiree medical program last month. This medical benefit was eliminated for most colleagues more than a decade ago. The net result of the 2 headwinds in this mitigating action was a benefit to operating income of $23 million or $0.03 per share. Looking forward, if foreign exchange rates remain at their present levels, we estimate the impact of the 2 macro headwinds will be $0.08 in the second quarter, $0.06 in the third quarter and $0.04 in the fourth quarter. It also helps to look at the net impact of these items by segment. In the first quarter, the mitigation almost completely offset the macro headwinds in the Consulting segment and had a positive impact on profitability and margins in the Risk and Insurance Services segment. In the second quarter, the headwind should impact Risk and Insurance Services slightly more than Consulting. In the third and fourth quarter, about 1/3 of the headwinds are expected to impact the RIS segment, with 2/3 impacting Consulting. So as we progress throughout the year, it may be best to look at profitability growth and operating margin improvement on a year-to-date basis. We expect adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter to be similar to last year. And as the year-over-year impact to the macro headwinds dissipates, we expect EPS growth in the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half. We think it is important to share this level of detail in order to give the investment community insight regarding the net impact by quarter and by segment of the macro headwinds, our overall business plans and our mitigation actions. I would like to reiterate what Dan said earlier, we expect to generate high-single-digit growth in earnings per share this year. Investment income was $2 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $11 million from a year ago. Investment income is expected to be de minimis in the second quarter unless there is a change in the status of Trident III. Corporate expense was $44 million, in line with our anticipated quarterly expense level. Over the last several years, we appreciate our debt portfolio. Our most recent transaction was in March, when we issued $500 million of 5-year senior notes. As a result of these actions, our average cost to debt has declined substantially, for example, from 5.1% in the first quarter of last year to 3.4% this quarter. Our next debt maturity is a $50 million term loan due in March of next year. Our cash was approximately $260 million in the United States. Uses of cash in the first quarter included outlays for our annual bonus awards, which have increased in each of the past 6 years; $300 million to repurchase 5.3 million shares of our stock; $151 million for dividends; and $140 million for acquisitions and investments. With that, I am happy to turn it back to Dan.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thanks, Mike. So Jamie, we're ready to begin the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: On the EPS outlook, I just want to confirm that the starting point, that high single-digit EPS growth rate is $2.82 for full year '14, which is the adjusted number.
Daniel S. Glaser: That's correct, Jay. That's correct.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: The other thing that caught my attention in the quarter was the pace of the buybacks, $300 million in the quarter. Can you talk about why that accelerated in 1Q and what the implications are perhaps for the rest of the year in terms of buyback?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. Well, if you go back to last year, we returned between acquisitions, dividends and share repurchase $2.35 billion to shareholders. And we made the comment in our last call that we would expect this year to be at least that amount. So we feel very comfortable with our ability to return value to shareholders through those 3 actions. And when we look at it, our overall feel as we go forward would be that you'll see us over time reducing cash on the balance sheet, increasing our level of leverage over time and putting that leverage -- increased leverage to work for our shareholders. And so our expectation in terms of share repurchases and acquisitions are similar to last year, although acquisitions is one of those things that you can never really quite time. And share repurchase, to us, would be a very good use of our money and certainly superior to growing cash on the balance sheet.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then my final question was, with regard to the first quarter, the offsetting benefit of closing the retiree medical plan, my sense is that had a benefit even on the adjusted operating income, especially for RIS. Is it -- can you provide us with sort of a normalized margin for 1Q relative to the 30.3% that was printed?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, sure. When you look at our margins in general, I think what the -- it's smart to not only back out things like foreign exchange but also back out the mitigation aspect, particularly in the first quarter, because that's where it landed so heavily. Even if you back all of that out on an underlying basis, MMC's margin would have been up about 50 bps, and we would have had margin improvement in both segments.
J. Michael Bischoff: Dan, I think you meant Risk and Insurance Services margins would have been up about 40 or 50 bps. Consulting is fairly straightforward.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ryan Tunis with Crédit Suisse.
Ryan Tunis - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I guess, my first question is just on your organic growth in U.S. and Canada. I know you mentioned -- I think it was driven by MMA. Just curious what was the growth there in MMA and what were some of the other puts and takes maybe against that 3% in U.S. and Canada?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure, well, we're not going to start disclosing quarterly individual units within segments and calling them out separately. But Peter, you want to talk broadly about the U.S. and Canada division?
Peter Zaffino: Sure. I'll start, Dan, with why we call that MMA. And we have been communicating on our quarterly calls about the quality of acquisitions that we're making, the ability that we have in terms of being meaningful in the middle market and having a national platform. But in addition to making those acquisitions and bringing something very unique to our clients and to the market, we had strong organic growth. And so we're seeing the components of strength from acquisition as well as from organic growth. In the U.S. and Canada division, again, we have multiple businesses that roll up in the reporting, and MMA was the leader in terms of its organic growth. The one thing that we'll have within overall Marsh as well as the U.S. and Canada division was a weak new business in the first quarter of last year. So therefore, the rollover had some impact in the first quarter growth. But overall, the fundamentals of client retention, strong new business and the 3% in the U.S. and Canada in a mature part of the world we were pleased with.
Ryan Tunis - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: That's helpful. And I guess, my follow-up would just be the $500 million debt deal you guys did, does that change your outlook, I guess, in terms of what you think you can do for dividend acquisition and share repo for the remainder of the year?
Daniel S. Glaser: Mike, you want to take that?
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes, thank you very much. This is basically in line with what we've been doing over the last 3 years in essentially reshaping our debt portfolio, or as some people say, debt maturity ladder. We look at it over a number of years and we started to reposition our 2014 and 2015 maturities. And then looking at that, we wanted to essentially have a smooth ladder going out into the future. We went through about 3 years with keeping our actual debt essentially flat at around $3 billion. And then, what we've been indicating to the investment community as well as the credit rating agencies that as our earnings continue to grow, we will begin to bring up our overall debt levels in a sequential fashion. And so it's very much in keeping with our long-term view, very consistent with what we've been doing. If you look at it on a seasonal basis, where we need the cash, where we -- where heavily utilization of cash, all things being equal, is in the first quarter due to our annual payments for bonuses. And so when we're increasing our debt, most likely on an annual basis, it could occur in the first part of the year. So that's a long answer to something to say, no, it's very consistent with the multiyear strategy.
Operator: And we'll go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just a follow-up on Jay's question on the margin expansion, especially in the RIS segment. Even you're excluding these foreign exchange and the pension impact, pretty healthy year-over-year improvement. Is that sort of -- if you look at organic growth at 3%, is that an indication, when the organic growth is 3% or above, we should see some meaningful margin expansion for these segments going forward?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, well, I'll start by saying, for quite a while, we've sort of used 3% as the baseline and saying, if we can grow organically 3% or better, we believe that we should be able to achieve some margin expansion. I wouldn't say it quite the way you did, Kai, in terms of, at 3%, there will be meaningful margin expansion. I mean, clearly, whatever the delta is between 3% and a higher number creates more of an ability for us to expand margins. And if we're closer to 3%, we wouldn't really be driving at that stage for margin expansion. But Mike, do you have anything to add?
J. Michael Bischoff: Just more specifics on the first quarter for the clarity. When we looked at the margin improvement in Risk and Insurance Services for the quarter, which was 310 basis points, we knew that, that was affected by the benefit -- the net benefit of the closing of the retiree medical plan post-65 in the United States. And so that's why we wanted to give the investment community much more specificity on the first quarter. So the benefit -- the net benefit that we indicated, the $23 million, was felt almost completely in the RIS segment. And so that's what I was saying earlier. If you just say, based upon the underlying growth in the segment, what would be the organic growth and what would be the margin improvement predicated on that. And thus for the RIS segment, it would be in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 bps. In Consulting, it's a different situation. The net headwinds and the net offsetting items essentially netted out. It was actually a $2 million or $3 million hurt in Consulting. So the margin improvement of 160 basis points was more of a true margin improvement for the segment in this quarter, excluding the impacts of the mitigating items and the macro headwinds.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Then a follow-up on the, sorry, on the Health segment. The organic growth 3% this quarter and -- just trying to see your view on, because last year -- end of last year, you have pretty meaningful increase in terms of your Mercer Marketplace, the private healthcare exchange. Just wondering how those grows, which translate into organic growth, in particular in the Health segment?
Daniel S. Glaser: Julio, you want to take that?
Julio A. Portalatin: Thank you, and thanks for the question. It allows us to provide some additional clarity and color around our Health growth, which we are actually very bullish on and I'm very pleased with. You might recall, a couple of years ago, we made an announcement that we will be incorporating our benefit admin business into our line of businesses. In this particular case, the Health and Benefits -- Benefit Administration business or Outsourcing was actually incorporated in our Health segment. And when we did that, of course, the results were -- have been actually pretty good, because we've been able to put profit improvement plans in place to improve our margins in that business. Part of that decisions -- part of those decisions that we make, of course, has to do with client and client retention, our ability to price adequately for the services that we give. So if you were to take the impact of some of the client retention challenges that we had because of anticipated action that we took to improve profitability in ben admin. If you were to take that impact out of the Health number, you would actually see what I think is a much more expected 7% growth. So our core Health, along with MMX, grew 7%. With the actions of ben admin, it impacted it to 3%. So we're very pleased, in fact. We had good performance in our Health business. We expect this to continue. Our client retention x ben admin is actually very strong, our commissions continue to increase. Mercer Marketplace will enhance this segment going forward. And it's important to keep in mind that we'll continue to invest in our exchange health business, because we think it's a robust environment for us to do so and to maintain our leadership position.
Operator: And we'll go next to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I guess, just a couple of questions. One is, so on the buyback -- I mean it's great to see you comment about leverage, Dan, and the buyback there. I guess, one question is, looking now running at the $200 million to $300 million quarterly run rate, 1Q seasonally light because of operating expenses, do you expect -- or should we expect that -- or can we infer that -- I mean, we'll look to maybe increase leverage a bit during the first quarter to sort of supplement the seasonally light cash flows there and to kind of adopt the, or espouse a run rate near this level on buybacks?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, I mean, I think the way you should look at it is more annual than quarterly. I mean, clearly, every year, we pay bonuses in the first quarter, and so it tends to be where we're cash light. And we have lots of items that -- and lots of ability to cover that. So that's not an issue. And as you see, we ended the year with quite a bit of cash on our balance sheet, including $260 million in the United States. And I would think, more over time, what you should consider is that we will be increasing our leverage over time and that by doing that will give us more capital flexibility, not only for share repurchase, but also for dividends and acquisitions. And we remain a very balanced player in those 3 areas. What I can be -- what you can infer from that is, is that our level of acquisitions will not necessarily impact our level of share repurchase that we're looking at really our ability to do more of each over time.
Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. Great, that's helpful. And then just on kind of to square the margin and FX and high-single-digit earnings comment. So if we think about the organic growth kind of sticking at this level on RIS, maybe we'll continue to see that sort of 50 basis point margin expansion through the year. So to get to that mid-single-digit EPS growth, does that mean that Consulting margins should -- we should expect to see this level of margin expansion? Or just -- I'm just trying to mathematically think about how we square kind of those points?
Daniel S. Glaser: So the way I would look at it is first look at last year, right, because that flip is not switched. Switch is not flipped and everything is different in the new year. And so if you look at last year, we grew overall as a company about 70 bps in margin, and RIS grew 30 bps and Consulting grew 160. When we think about this year in terms of 2015, I think what you'll see is RIS will probably be pretty similar to last year and Consulting will come off a bit from 160 bps. We're not expecting that for the full year, but we'll have some corporate benefit, because our corporate initiatives that we had in the back half of last year are unlikely to recur. So we'll have some benefit there. So overall, we feel like we'll end up with pretty good margin expansion for the company in -- during the year of 2015.
Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it, great. And then just the last quick one maybe, Julio, on the private exchange. Any update on enrollment from the last time we spoke? And one question I'd love to ask too is, thinking about like the employer size spectrum, I mean, can you talk about your initiatives or kind of hit rate in the sub-thousand or maybe mid-size or large on that front?
Daniel S. Glaser: Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin: Thanks for the question. As we've discussed in the past, it's our intention to give full updates of our Mercer Marketplace progress on a annual basis, it'll be towards the end of the year when we do that again. But I would like to remind of you a couple of things and maybe add some color to the size piece, because we did make some disclosures on that in the past. So as mentioned in the past, our total lives of eligible lives is over 1 million for both active and Medicare. And when you put those together, it's over 1 million. And when you add voluntary benefits and individual access mediums, we can add another 1.5 million or so. So we're up over 2 million when we talk about eligible lives. Mercer's U.S. Health and Benefits business touches millions of lives and gives us an opportunity to grow our exchange business over time as well as new prospects. We continue to have good interest from and dialogue with clients, both our current clients and new clients, both in the mid- and large-market companies, although we continue to see a little bit more momentum still in the mid-market versus the large market. And Mercer Marketplace has a key part of our future -- is a key part of our future, as you know. So if you look at some of the early adopters versus what our current numbers are, you'll see that in '14, we had about 67 clients. Now we have closer to 250 in '15. Talked about the number of lives already. If you break it down by client size, you'll see that nearly half of the clients that we have in our 2015 number is about, let's say, 5,000 or less on number of employees. So you still see a pretty good number of people going into the exchange that obviously are in the market space that is considered to be mid-market and below. And about 40% of our clients, by the way, would be somewhere in the area of over 5,000. But then again, when you look at jumbos over 20, it really drops considerably. So that goes to your comments earlier in terms of wanting more color as it relates to the size of the employees that we're currently having as part of our Mercer Marketplace initiative.
Operator: And we'll go next to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I was hoping to spend a little bit more time, I guess, on the acquisitions in light of your capital outlook for the year, a little bit lower in the first quarter. And I know if you guys can kind of just talk about what you're seeing in the acquisition pipeline, especially in terms of M&A, in terms of the MMA platform and if higher prices of deals have kind of caused you to walk away on that front, or just kind of what you're seeing there as we look for the balance of 2015?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. So I'll talk a little bit about acquisitions, and then I'll hand over to Peter to talk a little bit more about the pipeline within Marsh and in particular MMA. I think it's important to reiterate that our philosophy around acquisitions is that we have no budget or timetable associated with acquisitions. We work a pipeline and we develop relationships, and sometimes, it takes years to actually cultivate a relationship to where we then can have a discussion around whether they want to join with us or not. Our primary focus is on quality. We prefer companies that are growing faster than we are, that are trading at multiples below our multiples and where we can see that we can improve the business by working together. And from that standpoint, I might also say that we rarely participate in auctions. Auction environments -- they don't meet our philosophy, because actually, they're generally geared to optimizing the price for the seller as opposed to any kind of joining together of 2 different companies. So just to reaffirm, we develop relationships with really talented people over a long stretch of time. Now in terms of the multiples, I mean, it's clear over a number of years, there's been some expansion in multiples, generally fueled by low interest rates and the entry of many PE firms into the space. And multiples are important to look at, but it may be even more important to look at, well, what is the EBITDA, because these are private companies and you have to make assumptions around EBITDA. And sometimes, I would say that buyers can be far more optimistic about what those assumptions are than what we would be as a disciplined buyer. And so we also have to look at the projected growth rate. And from that standpoint, we're well practiced. As an overall company, last year was a fairly active year, and it added up to almost $1 billion worth of acquisitions. The pipeline overall for the entire company looks about the same. I'm not going to say it's fuller than what it was at this point last year. It's about the same. And we're working on some things that are consistent with our approach of a string-of-pearls strategy, where the average acquisition for us over the last 5 or 6 years has been around $40 million. And we're also working on some things that we would call more nuggets that might be a little bit more size, but those tend to take more time. And so Peter, you want to add in some on specifically about MMA?
Peter Zaffino: Sure. I think you summarized everything, Dan, for the organization, and it fits very well within MMA. We're working very hard to cultivate relationships. We don't have a budget, so it can be very lumpy from quarter-to-quarter or from year-to-year. And as Dan had mentioned, we very much focus on companies that can strategically position us differently, whether it's in a space like the SME or provide capabilities that we may not have. We made an acquisition of Torrent at the end of last year, which was a best-in-class flood servicing company with great technology. So we're very focused on making sure that we're cultivating those relationships. We tend not to be in a bid process. So in that cultivation of relationships, they tend to be just 2 parties involved. And if I can speak specifically about MMA and International, which is where we focus a lot of our acquisitions, we feel the pipeline is very strong for 2015. And we're optimistic that throughout the next several quarters, we should be able to move forward.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thanks. Elyse, would it be helpful if Julio talked a little bit about the investments that they've made where they haven't purchased 100% of a firm, but they've invested in Benefitfocus and Alexander Forbes?
Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Sure, that would be great.
Daniel S. Glaser: Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin: Okay, thank you. Yes, it's great to be able to give some additional color on this, because as we've talked about in the past, we have some very pointed strategies on how we want to continue to expand our business. In the case of Alexander Forbes, as mentioned earlier, it was very important for us to be able to get much more of a foothold and much more of a footprint in the Africa continent. And, of course, Alexander Forbes provides that in a very meaningful way. It's part of our focus to expand our new capabilities in growth markets, and of course, in the Investments and the Retirement space as well. So our investment in Alexander Forbes really helps us do that and continues to help us move forward. Benefitfocus, we're very excited about. I mean, obviously, we have a big investment going on in our exchange business. And we bought $75 million of newly issued shares of Benefitfocus, representing 9.9% of outstanding shares. And quite frankly, we're really pleased with the partnership that we've developed with Benefitfocus. We're developing proprietary approaches to the exchange base, and we want to make sure that, that was preserved over a long period of time, sustainable for us to count on for a long period of time. And we made the investment there, and we're very excited about our partnership in developing new things. As we continue to also invest in our Investments expansion, SEM came available to us. And through a lot of discussions over a period of time, we were able to secure that acquisition. Of course, that supports our Investments business, especially in the alternative investment space. So it really expands us in that area, because our clients have been asking us to actually provide great solutions in that space, and that helps us in that area. So as you can see, all of these acquisitions are really very strategic and very much aligned with our strategic purpose. And we'll continue to look for opportunities just like those.
Daniel S. Glaser: Any other questions, Elyse?
Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Yes, if we can also spend some time talking on Guy Carpenter. 2% growth in the quarter, just how you kind of think about the growth you can potentially see there on an underlying basis for the balance of 2015, especially in light of some of the price declines you've been seeing in the reinsurance market?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. Alex?
Alexander S. Moczarski: Sure, thanks. So the first quarter was actually a little stronger than we had expected, and the second quarter may be a bit tougher. We can expect -- it is a moderate or slight to moderate underlying growth environment for us. We expect to grow over the year slightly, maybe even moderately. But the next quarter may be a little bit tough. And we may have clumpy quarters, because when you're in that sort of environment where the percentages are small, one quarter will be stronger than the other. But we do believe that we've got a good pipeline. We continue to innovate. We continue to be relevant. As there are more options around capital, we are agnostic to where that capital comes from, and our clients are looking for -- there's interest in unbiased but informed alternatives. We have been specializing, as you know. We've been segmenting. We opened up a Mutual Company Practice in 2013, the Excess and Surplus Line practice, the Cyber Solutions Specialty in 2014, Healthcare in 2014 and just announced the Public Sector Specialty Practice. So we continue to seek relevance. We continue to seek innovation. We've got strategic advisory teams around the world, helping companies grow, helping companies face increased regulation. So we're optimistic about our growth -- about continued growth this year, though, at a, as I said, slight to moderate pace.
Daniel S. Glaser: To sum that up, GC is doing a terrific job in specialization and segmentation, and all that hard effort enables them to eke out some level of growth in a low growth environment. And that's our expectations for the year.
Operator: And we'll go next to Dave Styblo with Jefferies.
David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I think I'll flip the other side of the business on Marsh for the organic growth there. Another solid quarter of 3%. I guess, as I was looking at things, it's a little bit lower than any of the quarters last year. And obviously, the environment, as you mentioned, is a little bit more challenging. But I'm curious what you're seeing more specifically in the end market. Is there any sort of more material slowdown in activity or increased competition? Or on the other side, I'm just wondering if there's perhaps any sort of timing of revenue that might have been going on in the quarter?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. So I'll just take that broadly and then hand over to Peter. I think when you look at the segment overall, one thing to consider is that we -- for the last 17 out of 18 quarters, we have grown organically 3% or better. And so as you stated, we've had some periods of higher than that, but we've really done a good job creating that as essentially our floor in the segment. But Peter?
Peter Zaffino: Yes. I had commented on the United States earlier. So perhaps I'll just give a little bit of insight on International and its growth. First of all, we have a terrific International business. It's really balanced with strength across the entire geographical platform. But in the first quarter, it is heavily weighted towards EMEA. We had 2% growth in EMEA, 5% in Asia-Pac really led by Asia and 6% in Latin America. So there are couple of factors impacting the growth -- again, nothing to be concerned about. But we had modest renewal growth in the quarter, and that was primarily based on 2 factors. One is we had slow new business growth in the first quarter of 2014, so that had a slight impact on the rollover for 2015. And then pricing coming off a little bit more thinking mid-single digits led by Property in the International business had some impact. The real positives for us is that we had a terrific new business in the quarter. So we were up 7% in International. And in Continental Europe, we had 10% new business growth. And then in the U.K., we had 8%. Other strong performances we had, Africa at 15% and Latin America in double-digit. So we are winning in the marketplace. We are in a very positive way and a balanced way growing our portfolio through adding clients. And so we had a little bit of an impact from last year. Again, it's heavily weighted towards Europe and the U.K. So when you think about the macroeconomic factors and the slight impact, again, we had from rollover, new business and the rating environment, we were pleased with the performance.
David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Sure, okay. Is it more appropriate to think more like a 3-ish percent organic growth for the year as opposed to kind of 4% to 5% clip you were at last year then?
Daniel S. Glaser: No, I don't think that would be appropriate. I think the way you should look at it is the overall company, including RIS and including Marsh, has been operating in a 3% to 5% organic growth area. And we're just as likely to pop out of that as we are to go underneath it. But 3% to 5% seems the more accurate way to look at it over a longer period of time.
David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And then a little bit more coming back to Benefitfocus. I know you started to highlight that. I'm just curious to get a better sense of the rationale for the investment. Obviously, you guys have been working with them for a while. What was the reason for needing to actually help make the investment in there? I guess, at one point, the company was burning through a little bit of cash. Was it just to the help the company out, make sure the business was [indiscernible] so that they could focus on operations? Or was there something new in terms of the expansion of the contract terms and things and services that they were doing for you that is part of this new relationship?
Daniel S. Glaser: I'll say broadly, and then I'll hand over to Julio, that we saw a tremendous opportunity to develop a closer relationship where we could collaborate more deeply. And we certainly weren't needed as a cash source for them. They had all kinds of different choices. And we are very pleased that we were able to make an equity investment in return for some cash. But Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin: Yes, thanks for the question. As you know, the importance of Mercer Marketplace is high on our list of priorities. It's -- Mercer Marketplace is our proprietary benefit exchange solution. It's powered by Benefitfocus. And our relationship has flourished. We now serve a lot of lives together, including active and retirees, as well as their dependents in our Mercer Marketplace as part of exchange. This equity investment enhances that relationship. It strengthens our proprietary solution. And it allows us to more closely collaborate and align on employer and consumer development needs. And those were the primary reasons why we actually went in and did the equity investment. It solidifies the partnership, and in essence, allows us to look at things more strategically together, as the exchange business continues to evolve and grow.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Larry Greenberg with Janney Capital.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I guess, this is for Mike, and it relates to FX and other good stuff like that. So is it fair to say that the pension impacts, both the costs and mitigation efforts, are still expected to completely offset one another for the year and that the FX impact is now up to $0.30 a share from what you had indicated, $0.15 coming out of the fourth quarter?
Daniel S. Glaser: Mike, you want to take that?
J. Michael Bischoff: Okay, thank you. Larry, and I'm glad you asked for clarity. When we look at the total headwinds, pension, the lower interest rates essentially impacting our pension expenses on a year-over-year basis and foreign exchange, it comes to roughly $240 million to $250 million pretax dollars or roughly $0.30 a share. And it basically is roughly equal between the 2 macro headwinds. So about $0.15 of foreign exchange, about $0.15 of, call it, the impact of lower interest rates. That's very consistent with what we had said on the fourth quarter earnings call. The numbers just changed a bit, meaning a few million. But the total aggregate amount was still in that $240 million, $250 million category. So to be very clear, the foreign exchange impact is $125 million for the year, and we felt almost about $50 million of that in the first quarter.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Just on Guy Carpenter, I saw that there was a negative 2 point impact from M&A. I'm just curious what that was?
J. Michael Bischoff: Larry, that's just the category -- this is Mike. That's just the category, where we say transfers the businesses between different of our operating units and others. So that's really what it was. We wanted to be very clear when we showed just the underlying growth. It's true business growth to the investment community, and so that was really in the other category.
Operator: And we'll go next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I want to talk a little about FX. And obviously 1/1 is a big day for you guys. You -- and currency is currency is much stronger on 1/1. When you think about the new year 2016, is there much of an FX impact expected, I mean, I guess, particularly from Guy Carpenter or whatnot?
Daniel S. Glaser: Well, why didn't you tell us, Josh?
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Where interest rates are right now?
Daniel S. Glaser: Well, I think FX moves in a lot of different factors other than interest rates, and there's many variables. And it tends to move in cycles. I mean, we've looked at the movement of the dollar all the way since Bretton Woods. And the reality over that length of time, where it's sort of close to the median level of where the dollar has been, it feels a lot stronger, just because it was weaker over the last period of time. But actually, over a longer period of time, it's about at the median. And it's really the volatility rather than the -- rather than whether the dollar is strengthening. And we were -- I think the whole world was taken by surprise in the period from, say, late October, early November all the way through to, say, the end of January. And so we're not anticipating that, but ultimately, we're working on a series of mitigating actions to try to make sure that both a -- that we're as prepared as we can be in a situation of either a strengthening dollar or interest rates to where that could create an impact on 2016.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Well, yes. I'm just talking about as through January 1 though. Given -- when you guys -- or on the last conference call, you had, I would imagine, a good sense of where your FX would be by the end of year, because a disproportionate amount of the revenue for the quarter was already earned through by the time you held the conference call.
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, I mean, if you -- well, if you look at our quarters in general, Guy Carpenter is a little bit more weighted toward January than the other operating companies. Europe is a little bit more weighted toward January within Marsh. But Marsh actually, as the biggest opco, is pretty well balanced between the first, second and fourth quarter, and the third quarter is the shortest quarter. So I don't think you can read too much into the results as to whether we anticipate headwind January 1st or not from FX, because I think it's too early to say. I think the important thing to remember with FX is over a longer period of time for long-term shareholders, it has been a wash for Marsh & McLennan Companies, and that's over 10 years or 20 years. And so from that standpoint, this is a an issue that has arisen for this year. The last few years, we have worn $0.04 or $0.05 a year of headwind on it. This was just a spike year, in our view, but it's hard to tell where the macro world goes, and there's an awful lot of variables beyond interest rates that impacts the U.S. dollar.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: That's perfectly reasonable. And then, I can probably do the math myself and get it wrong. If I take all the puts and takes from FX, interest rates, pensions, the mitigation efforts, in terms of your long-term target of 13% EPS growth, where did the quarter shake out on a normalized basis?
Daniel S. Glaser: Well, I would say, I'd go back to what we said last quarter, which was when we were looking at 2015, we were saying, if we looked at the year of 2015 on a constant-currency basis, we thought that we would deliver a result which was akin to our 13% long-term growth target. And that's just the impact of FX. And so from that standpoint, we expect to be high-single-digit EPS growth this year taking into consideration all of those factors, and we're working on a series of initiatives now that could potentially be utilized for next year in the event that there's headwinds that we have to deal with.
Operator: And we'll go next to Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: 2 quick questions just for you. First one, Mike, just a question on the pension. Any changes to the expected cash into the pension plan this year with the changes that you've made?
Daniel S. Glaser: Mike?
J. Michael Bischoff: Good question. No, I think we're anticipating $190 million.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. So it doesn't change at all. Okay, great. And then secondly, I'm just curious, I noticed you hired somebody, a pretty senior person, for tax in the first quarter. Any kind of updated thoughts? I know you chatted about it on last conference call, but any kind of updated thoughts on what you can do to get your tax rate down?
Daniel S. Glaser: Well, actually we've hired 2 senior people within the finance department recently. Both the head of tax and also a treasurer. But Mike, you want to talk a little bit about tax more broadly?
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes, I would say with regard to the new head of tax, it's really just long-term planning -- succession planning, and we're very fortunate to get a very, very capable individual to add to our team. When you look at tax, obviously, we were looking at a lot of issues across the entire globe. The thing that would help us the most, but we can't wish for, is a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate. It's among the highest, if not the highest, in the developed world. The other issue with regard to the U.S. tax regulations is that it makes it very difficult to bring international cash back to the United States in a tax efficient manner. And so a lot of our efforts are predicated to that. When we look at what we've done over the last 4 or 5 years, the tax rate, either on an adjusted basis or on a GAAP basis, has averaged in a range of 29.5% and about 30%. And I think that's probably a good range to use for modeling purposes going forward.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then just quickly, from an on operations perspective, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about opportunities. With cybersecurity, what you've done to beef up, is there anything that you still need to do from an investment perspective to get yourself in a position to really take advantage of what looks like it's going to be a big opportunity for you all?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, I'm glad you mentioned that, Brian, because it is a tremendous opportunity for the insurance community at large. And it's probably one of those things that -- it's a journey without end. I mean, in terms of what kind of innovations we can do to help better prepare our clients to not only beef up and be aware about risks associated with cyber, but also gain some level of risk transfer protection. So the insurance industry has done a great job in other areas over a long period of time of helping spread best practice and actually help clients avoid and mitigate risks before they even think about transferring it. And we think that Marsh & McLennan Companies has a tremendous role to play, in not only risk transfer, but also risk identification, risk avoidance, risk mitigation. But Peter, do you have something to add to that?
Peter Zaffino: We just -- yes, Dan, with RIMS being this week, we just launched some additional cyber capabilities. So we do agree that the high-profile breaches, the awareness at the board level, risk appetite in new industries like financial institutions, retail and healthcare, there is definitely an increased demand. And I think insurance companies are being very thoughtful in trying to offer capacity. We have continued to expand our modeling capabilities and just launched Marsh Cyber Monitor and Marsh Cyber View. I won't go into great detail, but it's a fresh look at cyber by continuously updating different threat indicators, and the analytics side is looking outside in, provides a very interesting lens into companies in risk scoring. And so we're able to do that in a real-time basis and have partnered with a company called Cyence. We announced it on Monday and believe that we will be arranging capacity for clients and have already rated 40,000-plus companies in the U.S. So I think it's an emerging and evolving part of our business, well, one that we think will have high growth over time.
Daniel S. Glaser: So operator, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Thomas Mitchell with Miller Tabak.
Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: A couple of semi-philosophical questions here. First of all, when you think about the "mitigation opportunities" that you have, and you mentioned having more mitigation opportunities going forward, how does that tally with your general view of the value proposition you offer to employees who might expect to work until they retire?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. So I'll take that broadly, and I enjoy your semi-philosophical question, Thomas. But I think you're on to something, because ultimately, all mitigation in a company has to be finding ways of reducing organic expense as a way to mitigate some headwinds that can be anticipated. And then you look at, well, what organic expenses do you have to try to mitigate. And there is a whole serious of things, but compensation and benefits is the largest expense category of all professional services firms. And then you have areas like technology, real estate, travel and entertainment, et cetera. And so you have to look at those things really broadly. When -- I think, as a good example of the way we approach our work with colleagues, I mean, we really do believe very sincerely that our colleague base is the heart and soul of the entire company. And actually, when we're making decision as an executive committee, we always have the thought of is this good for colleagues on a mid- and long-term basis in our minds when we're making those decisions. So I really don't think it has anything to do with people as they're getting closer to retirement and that sort of thing. I mean we're an industry that actually builds knowledge, and historical knowledge is incredibly important. And so from that perspective, I think that we have a lot of people who have had significant experiences in our businesses over long periods of time, who are still working for us, and we're happy they are.
Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: And you're basically at a standard that's the same as the rest of the industry. So you're not likely to get producers taken away from you for any reason for that.
Daniel S. Glaser: I wouldn't have as a standard view us as being similar to any of the companies that you think our traditional competitors are. The fact of the matter is Marsh & McLennan Companies is a unique company and we do not have a single competitor in the world that competes with us globally across our operating companies. We have some competitors that come close to that. But in our view, we don't have the issue that you're citing about production or producers. We're not a producer culture. We are a content [indiscernible] and we employ people who enjoy working in a creative environment for smart people who are dedicated to working on clients, and it's self-selecting. So we attract those sorts of people, and we have not seen any abnormal blips in our voluntary turnover over the last several years.
Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: Okay. No, that's very helpful. I appreciate that. Now I have a sort of different kind of question for Mike, which is, if I -- just -- if we just sort of close our eyes and we're sitting a year from now, now our sort of base is essentially $0.76 a share, that is we're now looking at foreign exchange neutral as if there were no change from March 31, '15, to March 31, '16. So in that case, it's perfectly reasonable for you to make the comparisons to do against first quarter '14. I'm not talking about that. But now that we're looking at that, my basic question is, are the things that come in either on an annual basis or even a quarterly basis from this termination of this plan that would essentially benefit either quarterly or annual earnings going forward, perhaps not by as much as the one-time adjustment, but would be an ongoing or recurring savings for the company.
J. Michael Bischoff: Okay. So thanks, Thomas. Thank you, Thomas. And Mike?
J. Michael Bischoff: The answer is that we've been dealing with these 2 macro headwinds, depending on how you count, for 4 or 7 years. In aggregate, the interest rates -- lower interest rates have cost us probably $0.55 on our earnings, and the foreign exchange over the last 4 years has cost us $0.30, enormous amounts. Yet every year, we continue to have growth despite the headwinds. And I think that's what we're looking at in '16 and beyond.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Thanks, Mike, and thanks, Thomas. And I'd like to thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning. Specifically, and having Peter and I just returning from RIMS, I'd like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. Have a good day, everybody. Thank you.
Operator: And again, that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation, and have a great day.

Operator: Welcome to the Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Fourth quarter and Full Year 2014 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the Company's website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements.  Please refer to the company's most recent SEC filings, which are available on the MMC Web site for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Please go ahead sir.
Dan Glaser: Thank you, Matt. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO and our operating companies' CEOs, Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter, Julio Portalatin of Mercer and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh of Investor Relations. We had another year of outstanding performance in 2014 capped by a strong fourth quarter. We are a global growth company with many enduring qualities; talented colleagues, deep client relationships, a vast global footprint, depth of intellectual capital, a collaborative culture which seeks to harness our collective intelligence, a proven leadership team known for keeping its commitments and delivering results. At Marsh & McLennan we do important work enabling our client success by helping them address the challenges and opportunities of our time. The current global landscape is one brisling with increasing risks, but also opportunities. Cyber security, political and economic uncertainty in the euro zone, slowing economic growth in developing economies, plunging oil prices, historically low interest rates, a strong U.S. dollar all of these trends have gained momentum in the past six months illustrating not only the issues governments, multinational corporations and most organizations face but how the speed of change presents its own set of challenges. In an increasingly complex and dynamic world, C-suite needs answers and Marsh & McLennan Companies is ready to provide solutions around the globe.  We made a distinctly positive impact on the businesses, people and societies we serve by providing guidance and support during critical moments. Our competitive positioning as a trusted advisor to our clients has never been stronger. We are at the forefront of industry innovation and thought leadership around important issues such as advising in aging population how to save for retirement, managing global healthcare cost, developing and supporting client growth strategies, assisting our clients and anticipating and managing risks, navigating a new regulatory landscape in financial services and helping our clients capture opportunities in this world of risk.  Moving to our financial results, we had an excellent fourth quarter posting our strongest organic revenue growth of the year at 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 16%. The RIS margin rose 100 basis points to 21% and the consulting margin increased 120 basis points to 16.1%. We are proud of our strong financial and operating performance in recent years including our record of consistently higher earnings per share. Over the past five years, we have grown adjusted EPS at 14.5% CAGR and our consolidated adjusted operating margin improved almost 500 basis points.  Let's spend a minute on our strong performance in 2014. Adjusted EPS increased 14%, adjusted operating income rose by double-digit for the seventh consecutive year and underlying revenue grew 5% with contributions from each operating company. Margin expansion occurred in both the RIS and consulting segments, reflecting the broad-based nature of our growth. This marks the fifth straight year margins have expanded in both segments. At risk and insurance service the margin rose 30 basis points in line with what we communicated throughout the year. Consulting's growth was robust, the margin increased to 160 basis points and resulted in record consulting segment operating income approaching 1 billion. It's a powerful story and there is more to the story than financial performance.  We continue to enhance the value of Marsh & McLennan for our clients and our colleagues; we encourage innovation, creativity and challenge the status quo. We believe in the search to find the smarter way, our culture is vibrant, we're constantly building our talent with ongoing development programs, nurturing leadership capabilities and attracting the best and brightest at Marsh & McLennan. Fundamentally, our people are what set us apart.  The progress we have made not just in 2014 but over many years is a direct result of our investments for growth. Since 2009, we have invested nearly $5 billion for growth and efficiencies. This includes CapEx of $1.9 billion, 85 acquisitions totaling $3 billion and an increase in our headcount of over 7,600 colleagues. Our acquisition strategy is focused on growth market, not only geographically but by segment, by line of business and by capability. We were active last year completing 22 acquisitions and spending approximately $945 million and our pipeline remains robust. We expanded our international operations with acquisitions in Australia, Belgium, Scotland, Canada, Chile and Panama as well as in South Africa with our investment in Alexander Forbes.  Marsh & McLennan agency had an excellent year highlighted by the acquisition of Barney & Barney which established the agency's West Coast hub as well as eight other high quality agencies throughout the country. And we were pleased to host an Investor Day last March where we updated investors on MMC's long-term operating strategies as well as capital management initiatives. We're delivering on the commitments we made at Investor Day; we committed to long-term EPS growth of 13% and delivered 14% in 2014. We committed to double-digit dividend growth and delivered 10.4%, we committed to reducing our share count and reduced shares outstanding by 7 million, we committed to allocate 2.1 billion for dividends, acquisitions and share repurchase and utilized 2.3 billion.  For more than 140 years, we have been anticipating the changing needs of our clients as the scope challenges around risk, strategy and people grows and changes, the demand for our services should increase. We fully expect to continue to deliver on our long-term goals although this will not be without challenges. Over the past five years, we have faced a variety of macro pressures including low interest rates, weak global GDP growth and FX volatility just to name a few. We delivered each year for shareholders underlying revenue growth, margin expansion and EPS growth.  In 2015, we faced even more significant headwinds from the impact of low interest rates and a strong U.S dollar. Again we expect to deliver underlying revenue growth, margin expansion and EPS growth. Although our EPS growth in 2015 will be below what we achieved in 2014, we remain confident in our ability to grow EPS at a 13% CAGR over the long-term. With that let me turn it over to Mike. 
Mike Bischoff : Thank you, Dan and good morning everyone. In the fourth quarter, MMC delivered its 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and adjusted earnings per share an outstanding record of sustained performance. Revenue growth exceeded the increase and underlying operating expenses for the 17th consecutive quarter. In the quarter GAAP EPS was $0.54 and adjusted EPS rose 16%.  Risk and insurance services had a strong finish to the year. As revenue increased to $1.7 billion rising 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income rose 9% to $355 million. The adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 21%, the segments highest fourth quarter margin since 2003.  Marsh's revenue was $1.5 billion increasing 4% on an underlying basis. The international division was up 5% and the U.S Canada division rose 3%. Marsh's revenue growth was driven by record new business exceeding 300 million in the quarter. New business was strong in the U.S, Canada, the UK, Peru and Africa.  In a difficult operating environment, Guy Carpenter delivered 3% underlying revenue growth reflecting strong new business. On a geographic basis growth was led by U.S UK Facultative Asia Aviation and Marine.  Turning to our consulting segment revenue was $1.6 billion with excellent underlying growth of 8% adjusted operating income increased 13% to $251 million and the segments market expanded a 120 balance sheet to 16.1%. Mercer’s revenue increased 5% on an underlying basis to $1.1 billion with all major geographies contributing. Investments had 12% underlying revenue growth retirement grew 5%, health 4% and talent 2%. Oliver Wyman revenue reached $460 million underlying revenue growths of 15% was exceptional exceeding even our own expectations all industry's sector contributed to growth in the quarter. With geographic strength in North America and Europe. In summary, MMC produced another strong quarter both from a revenue growth and earnings standpoint. And the results for the year were excellent as well. With strong underlying revenue growth substantial margin improvement and adjusted EPS growth of 14%. As expected, investment income was de minimis in the fourth quarter it should also be de minimis in the first quarter. As we highlighted on our last two earnings call, investment income in the last half of 2014 was expected to be offset by cooperate initiatives Additional cooperate spending in the third quarter of $13 million and $11 million in the fourth quarter essentially offset investment income over the second half of the year. Going forward, we anticipate the quarterly corporate expense should approximate 45 million. We issued $800 million of debt in September and use the proceeds in October to fund $630 million of debt obligations and cost for the early extinguishment of this debt. We successfully utilized excess cash in 2014. This resulted in cash decreasing from $2.3 billion to $1.95 billion at year end. With $1.3 billion held internationally $332 million for nine acquisitions and investments was the cash utilized in the fourth quarter also including a $166 million for the second tranche of Mercer's investment and Alexander Forbes.  Returning capital of these shareholders remains the priority. In the fourth quarter, we utilized $154 million for dividends and $200 million to repurchase 3.7 million shares. And for the year cash deployed included $945 million for 22 acquisitions and investments $800 million to repurchase 15.5 million shares and 583 million for dividends. Annual dividends paid per share increased 10.4% last year. Looking ahead we remain optimistic about the underlying operating performance of our businesses. And our ability to deliver strong financial results over the long term. This year our results will be affected by macro-economic headwinds that have grown substantially in the last several months specifically the continuing decline in interest rates thus impacting our GAAP pension expense and the strengthening of the U.S. Let me make a few observations regarding our global retirement plans. Pension accounting considers many factors in addition to the effect of discount rates and asset returns GAAP pension expense reflects projected salary increases, mortality rates, demographics, inflation and contributions. Cash contributions to our global pension plans which were $181 million in 2014 should be approximately $190 million in 2015. At the end of 2014, average interest rates used to measure our pension liabilities declined from the prior year by approximately 100 basis points not only in the U.S but throughout the world. We expect retirement expenses for MMC overall including both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. The increase by approximately $125 million in 2015. We are currently implementing actions to mitigate all of this expense increase. The planned action with the greatest impact representing the substantial portion of our mitigation efforts to affect the post 65 retiree medical reimbursement program in the United States.  This benefit was eliminated for most colleagues in 2005. As a global multi-national company we are used to dealing with foreign exchange volatility. For example FX headwinds in each of the last three years negatively impacted EPS by $0.04 to $0.05 each year. As seen from our strong financial performance over this period, we absorbed this foreign exchange headwind. The significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar in recent months relative to the rest of the world's currencies will have a greater impact on us this year.  We recently updated our foreign exchange forecast which covers more than 60 currencies including the pound, euro, Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. If the dollar remains where it is today, operating income will be negatively impacted by approximately 120 million or $0.15 per share, well beyond what we absorbed over the past three years. We anticipate that the magnitude of the pension and foreign exchange headwinds on a year-over-year basis is by far the greatest in the first quarter. Our efforts to offset these two macro headwinds should be the most impactful in the first quarter as well. In conclusion, even though EPS growth this year will be below the growth of the past several years, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our 13% EPS growth target over the long-term. And with our growing cash flow, we expect to deliver double-digit dividend growth and to reduce the share account this year. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.
Dan Glaser: Thanks Mike. And Matt, we're ready to go to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb: Thanks. First, just wanted to follow up with Mike on the two major headwinds you outlined for 2015, retirement expense and impact of a strong dollar. Are you saying that the full impact that you outlined, $125 million retirement expense and $0.15 headwinds from a stronger dollar, that there will be mitigating factors to those in 2015? So it's not that full impact that will hit the bottom line?
Dan Glaser: Yes I'll take that Jay its Dan. Now what we tried to outline in our script we were saying to you that in terms of the pension expense that we are having planned actions to mitigate all of the pension expense headwind and so that's something that you don’t have to consider as having an impact on us, but we did point out that foreign exchange and the dollar in particular strengthening has much more of an impact than it would typically have in a given year. I mean when we look at FX as Mike was saying over the last three years, it's been $0.04 or $0.05 negative per year. The reality is over a 10 year period, it's an absolute wash and so it has no impact either way. As the U.S. multinational that's dollar-based they then operate in 130 different countries clearly we're going to always -- FX is always going to be a part of our results, but this is a higher level than we would seek to mitigate by taking operating actions. So we do expect foreign exchange ultimately to have a negative impact on our EPS for 2015.
Jay Gelb: All right. Thank you for clarifying that. Now, to follow up to that, understanding that you're saying MMC is unlikely to generate the type of 14% adjusted operating EPS growth that was delivered in 2014, but you're still committed to 13% long-term -- so in terms of what that means for 2015, do you still think you can do double-digit adjusted EPS growth this year? 
Dan Glaser: I mean at the end, we don’t give EPS guidance and so I don’t -- really don’t want to go down that path. I mean the only guidance we've given which we outlined on Investor Day last year was that we believe over a long period of time that we would deliver a CAGR of 13% a year and we still believe that. So any shareholder that is a shareholder over a long period of time, we are committing to a 13% CAGR on EPS. There's a lot of moving parts with respect to what generate EPS, it's way too early in the year for me to even have a view on that, I mean a lot has to do with top-line growth et cetera. And I would want to point also that on a constant currency basis if you looked at our business on that basis, we'd still be comfortable with saying that in 2015, we would deliver something akin to our long-term commitment of 13%. Next question please.
Operator: I'll move for our next question from Larry Greenberg from Janney Capital.
Larry Greenberg: The recent government budget proposal had some corporate tax rate suggestions. I'm just wondering what you're thinking about the tax rate prospectively. Obviously, if some of these proposals were to become law, it would certainly help. But maybe along the spectrum of where we are today to some of these potential positives coming to fruition, how you are thinking about the tax rate going forward.
Daniel Glaser: I will start with that and then I will hand it over to Mike. I do think that we've been watching the news in Washington and yes we start from the basis of -- well it doesn't appear that our tax situation can get worse as a country, so therefore we can only get better from here, so we're optimistic that that could apply. For a number of years now, we've actually been achieving double-digit adjusted EPS growth by actually improving our core business. And one of the reasons we are so focused on that not just because our leadership team is driven to achieve double-digit growth in adjusted EPS over the long-term, we also have ground to make up against many of our competitors who have tax positions which are superior to ours. So we have to develop the same kind of levels with cash flow working through operations because the U.S Tax Code is not a help. I mean specifically with regard to the U.S Tax Code our overarching view is that it needs to be competitive in order -- it needs to be reformed in order to be competitive with the rest of the world and currently it is not. So Mike you have anything to add to that?
Mike Bischoff : Yes, thank you Dan. Obviously with regard to corporate tax for in the U.S we would be very pleased to see a lower overall corporate tax rate. However, the other thing that's very difficult for us is the U.S multinational company is bringing our international earnings back into the United States for investments and returning capital to shareholders but anything that can be done to alleviate that and help us make U.S investments and return capital to our shareholders we would certainly be in favor of.  We do not count on reform until it's implemented and so in looking at your question on forward guidance I would point out just make a few observations -- point out a few things. First our overall tax rate has averaged 30% over the last five years and so that's probably a very on an adjusted basis and that's probably a fairly good number to model for 2015 until some legislative change occurs. We're just as in -- Scott pointed out in the fourth quarter it's lower on an adjusted basis it's about 29.5% and on a GAAP basis 27.7%. On the GAAP basis that's really due to the U.S tax treatment for the debt extinguishment. So, on a more normalized basis probably around 30%. 
Larry Greenberg: Thank you. Then I know you gave your exchange enrollee numbers after the third-quarter report. But I'm just wondering if Julio might just bring us up to date on how things were looking more towards year-end, beginning of the year, and just what's going on there.
Dan Glaser: Larry we're only going to give a formal update on the numbers once a year but having said that I am sure Julio has some color that he can add to the exchange, so Julio?
Julio Portalatin: So as we reported it back in October we're very pleased with the progress that we're making in our sane strategy, we reported north of 1 million lives that had summed up between active and Medicare and that continues to be robust in terms of pipeline that's building. Many of the clients that we had as you know in the middle market space but more importantly even for us 5,000 and above number of lives we actually doubled the amount of clients that came to us this year, last year was about 6%, this year is about 14%. So are beginning to see the edging up let's say of the type of clients that have a more volume in terms of employees.  Now it can be said also that if you compare that to middle market larger market clients or jumbo clients have been a bit slower to make this transition over but we're beginning to see some of it got to move over until high prices of employees. And that’s important because middle market clients well they continued increase we certainly want to have our share of also the jumbo market as that continues. So the pipeline is robust it's looking good for 2015. All of the numbers that we had projected in terms of number of lives per employee have come in right about what we expected, all of the savings that we also projected up to 15% are coming in right around what we expected, so, so far so good we're very excited about the prospects and continue to invest in our marketplace strategy for short, medium and long-term success. 
Operator: We will go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan: Good morning. Thank you. First question, Dan, you mentioned that the 2014 capital management plan, that $2.3 billion exceeded the original plan, $2.1 billion. Do you have an update for 2015? 
Mike Bischoff: Yes Kai, I would say that the $2.3 billion that we committed to an utilized in 2014 it will be at least that amount in 2015. 
Kai Pan: So in term of breakdown between, like, return to shareholders and acquisition, would that -- similar to what is seen in 2014? 
Dan Glaser: Acquisition we don’t budget for acquisitions. We have a pipeline and we worked the pipeline because so there could be a lot of variability with respect to acquisition. So it's a hard thing to peg right now I mean I would say and put it in the context we are committed to reducing our share account each year and we are committed to double digit increases in our dividend and so on that basis you can pretty much take what we did last year and extrapolate from there.
Kai Pan:  Then follow up on the acquisition front their recent press release that you might be interest in the UK broker. I understand you couldn’t comment on specific deals. But could you talk about your acquisitions strategy as part of your global growth strategy and reach markets with particular good markets or a geographic year is to the most of your interest. 
Daniel Glaser: Sure and I'm glad you recognize that we can comment on any specific deal or any speculation that can be out there from time to time. So I'll talk a little bit about acquisitions and if Peter, Julio, Alex and Scott want to add anything then we feel free. So first of all we have a philosophy right and our philosophy meanings that there is no budget or time tables acquisitions we're focused on quality above every other factor we prefer companies that are growing faster than we are they've traded a multiple below us and where we can see that we can improve their business or they can help us by adding some capability or geography that we currently don’t have. So somehow that they're going to make us better and generally we develop relationships with people highly talented people overtime and that’s why it's a slow, gestating pipeline I suppose to something that’s rapid. We're always as I mentioned looking at quality cultural fit consistent with our overall four pillar strategy focus on what kind of talent would be coming into the organization and how it makes us better and when all those things aligned usually economics work out. So we rarely participated in options we've been a disciplined acquirer and that maybe one of the reasons why we don’t acquire all that many things compared to the numbers that we look at because we're disciplined about our approach. We're not limited by geography as you can see we've committed over the last several years most of our acquisition capital has been in the United States as we have follow through on our agency strategy in the U.S. But fundamentally we're very interested in international acquisitions and we're looking from both from geographic basis from a line of business from a capability basis all kinds of different types of companies. And so I would say that our pipeline is robust. And folks you have anything to add, Peter you want to add to that. 
Peter Zaffino: Of course very consistent with what you just said Dan its quality each companies that have a track record of growth once that have geographical compliments. And we also are a very disciplined on our segmentation strategy. We like to be patients I think that’s evidence in how we pursued agencies Marsh & McLennan agency we're now entering our sixth year in the journey. But we feel very proud of the high quality agencies that we've been able to acquire. We integrate a group of best practices and so not only do we grow through acquisition we've been growing organically and have a very strong pipeline and we always are very committed to investing in business after we acquire them. So we like the SME space I can't see its expanding across the world overtime but again will be patient and try to find the right fit.
Daniel Glaser: Julio you have anything to add to that.
Julio Portalatin : Again very supportive of Dan's comments in terms of what our umbrella is as we go after acquisitions. But you probably took notice that in 2014 we had an increase of acquisition opportunities that came versus way of course starting with the Alexander Forbes investments that we made just north of $300 million in addition to that we've made the Jeitosa Group acquisition which is significantly important to us for work day implementation in both Europe and the U.S. And we've made the strategic acquisition for HCM which is an alternative investment base that we want to expand because we opportunity there and I'm sure you see the numbers that investments management business is really growing for us. So we're going to continue and concentrate on were the growth areas are and where the opportunity for growth is. And that is our number objective right now and all the culture issues are taking care et cetera we're looking for expansion of growth opportunities geographically and within segments.
Operator: We'll go next to Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee. 
Dan Farrell : Hi, good morning. A question on the pension costs and then the offset in the medical costs that you said. Is the medical cost offset a cash benefit? The reason I'm asking is your cash pension costs really aren't moving much at all. So it's really only on a GAAP basis that pension is moving. But I'm wondering if the offset that's helping the GAAP is a true cash benefit. 
Dan Glaser : No it's accounting in both ways. So both the pension headwind and offset are both accounting items. 
Dan Farrell: Okay. Then just switching over to your comments at the beginning, where you really talked a lot about the difficult and challenging environment we're in globally and how that's creating a lot of work and projects for you. I am wondering with regard to the Consulting segment, particularly in Oliver Wyman. Very good organic results; tougher comparisons. But do you see an environment where you're getting increasing flow of projects and other revenues that could keep overall Consulting organic growth at a healthy level? 
Dan Glaser : Scott, you want to take that.
Scott McDonald: Yes I'll talk a little bit about Oliver Wyman, but keep in context this is the smaller part of our consulting segment, I mean we have a good fourth quarter finishing off a strong year overall. And that was driven by pretty robust amount across sectors and across regions and in fact a little more robust than we'd expected. But we do expect consulting demand across the world to grow slightly faster than GDP in the years to come as the world remains pretty complex and we think the successful top-tier firms will grow faster than that as they take share from others and we're squarely in that group, so we expect to grow faster than that. I think the numbers we grew out in 2014, again we wouldn’t expect to see that in 2015 and the best guidance I can give there is still mid to high single-digit growth rates for our business.
Dan Glaser : Sure, next question operator.
Operator: We'll go to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, good morning. I was hoping to spend a little bit more time just going back to the capital plan and your outlook. Does that assume -- take into account potentially taking on any more leverage during the year? And then can you just update us on your view on just more long-term how much leverage you would potentially look to add? 
Dan Glaser : Sure I'll start with that and then I'll hand over to Mike. Clearly and as we discussed at Investor Day and after Investor Day our view overtime is to reduce the cash on the balance sheet somewhat and increase our overall level of leverage as well and put that extra amount of money to work and so if you look at year-end 2014 versus year-end 2013 we increased our debt by 433 million and we reduced our cash by 362 million and so that's part of a strategy and so I think you'll see that on an ongoing basis and emphasis on reducing cash on the balance sheet and increasing our overall level of leverage but Mike what would you add to that.
Mike Bischoff: Yes Dan I probably can't add too much but just to start with premise, it's nice that we have four operating companies that generate increasing amounts of not only revenue and earnings but cash flow, so it's a very nice position to be in as a Chief Financial Officer to work with my colleagues in these operation. So the first premise is that we expect our operating cash flow to go up in that regard. Dan I would completely agree with you, we used about 350 million of excess cash that was on our balance sheet. We're certainly going to try and do that probably in the same magnitude this year, limited a bit to what international acquisitions we may see and our ability as I mentioned earlier to bring cash back -- international cash back into the U.S. in a tax efficient manner, so in that regard we're looking to fairly robust year in 2015 above what we did in 2014.
Dan Glaser : Any other question, Elyse?
Elyse Greenspan: Yes, thank you. If we could also just flip and talk a little bit about what you are seeing at Guy Carpenter. I know the growth has been steady towards the end of the year. We've continued to see growth there even while we continue to talk about headwinds in the reinsurance pricing environment, which we've heard intensified during the January 1 renewals. If you can just comment on what you are seeing there, and just a little bit about your outlook for 2015. Thank you. 
Dan Glaser : Sure, Alex why don’t you take that?
Alex Moczarski: We're really pleased with the year. But also, considering that we were flat in the first quarter, to be able to end up with 2% underlying growth for the year is good but it's now been six years where we haven’t had a single quarter that's been negative just one flat the rest good. So we're leaning forward and I'm really proud of the team and what they do that in respect. The fourth quarter from a point of view of rating not terribly important because we don’t have a lot of renewals there we had high retention and good new business and our outlook for 2015 is somewhere between slight and moderate growth as we continue to have a good pipeline of new business and retention rates are high, due to, I believe good service and innovation.
Dan Glaser : Thanks Alex, next question operator.
Operator: We'll go to Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. Good morning. I'm to follow up on that topic. Is there any direct or indirect benefit from the recently increased amount of consolidation that we are seeing in insurance and reinsurance?
Dan Glaser : Yes I mean I'll just take that I mean at the end of the day the consolidation in both insurance, reinsurance and insurance broking is really a 25 year story and so there's been new capital formation, there's been consolidation and that's kind of story continues. We exist to serve our clients and so having a robust competitive market with a lot of choices is good for our clients and good for both Marsh and Guy Carpenter and even with the recent consolidations and announce consolidation, there is a significant level of competition in the insurance industry at multiple levels and multiple fronts. And so I don't there has been any direct or indirect impact on our business as a result nor do we plan for there to be impacts as a result of consolidation in the insurance sector. 
Meyer Shields: Okay. And I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the risk and insurance organic growth in Latin America?
Dan Glaser: First of all it's really a Marsh question I suppose to a broader risk and insurance services question because they don't specifically outline Carpenter on a Latin America basis. Latin America is one of our strongest growth regions and has been for quite a period of time as a company -- as a full company. One of the reasons why if you look at our acquisition strategy and then look at 2014, we made acquisitions in Peru, Panama and the Dominican Republic, so we're absolutely committed to Latin America as a region and we see it as having tremendous growth potentials in the future. Peter you want to take the specific question. 
Peter Zaffino: Yes, sure thanks Dan. So we had underlying growth of 3% and it certainly is not reflecting its historic growth rates on a quarter-to-quarter basis. But there is a few things that happened in the quarter, so I will try to give a little bit more detail. One is we had a challenging comparable from the prior fourth quarter which had 13% growth, we had some one-time items from prior year acquisitions that didn't repeat in the fourth quarter of 2014, we had significant non-recurring business so some of the really strong business we saw in 2013 did not recur and we're seeing some impact from the economic slowdown. But as Dan said if you take a look at the full year we had 10% growth it's going to be lumpy from time to time if you look at even international we had 5% organic growth, if you look at each quarter there have been different parts of international that have contributed 130 countries and so we think it is very well balanced, it's a major contributor to what's in terms of top-line organic growth as a percentage basis but just putting context it's about 7% of Marsh's total revenue. 
Operator: We will go next to Chris Cliff Gallant, Nomura.
Cliff Gallant: Thanks for taking the question. Mike I was wondering you mentioned that I believe in talking about the pension calculations that globally you are assuming an interest rate that's down a 100 basis points now and I was wondering on an absolute basis what that number is today?
Mike Bischoff : Okay, thank you, yes we're not assuming it is actually based upon where interest rates are at the end of 2014 which is used for the measurement for pension going forward. And just an example the discount rate was roughly 5.3% at the end of '13 in the U.S, it was 4.3% at the end of '14. In the UK it was 4.6% at the end of '13 and about 3.65% at the end of '14; those are the two largest plans. But if we look at it throughout the world it was unusual that in almost every geography we dealt in whether it was Canada, Ireland or what have you interest rates across the maturity ladder that you use for pensions which is more mid to longer-term were down a 100 basis points. 
Cliff Gallant: Okay. That makes sense. The second question I had was just on the -- when I look at the brokerage margin for the full year, the 22.4% -- very good number and improvement over the year. If we were to set aside the impact of some of the macro things like interest rates and foreign exchange, I was curious: how would mix change affect that number as we go forward? In terms of where you're growing, where you're not, and so forth. 
Dan Glaser: Well let me just take the question broadly as the margin question. As we've said couple of times before well margins improve in our organization as an outcome of us growing revenue at a faster rate than we grow expense. We're most focused on revenue growth and organic revenue growth in particular and increasing our earnings. And the margin improvement sort of comes a little bit further down on the Hit Parade. Having said that for both RIS in the quarter up a 100 basis points and consulting up 120 bps and MMC for the quarter being up 70 bps points and for the year being up 70 bps we're very pleased with that performance, we think it's strong margin performance and our 7th straight year of margin improvements and the 5th straight year that our margins were up in both segments. And so we feel very good about our margins and I just want to say that on a going forward basis and in particular for 2015 we believe we can improve our margins notwithstanding the headwinds that we're facing, we believe that we will improve our margins in 2015 in both segments. 
Operator: We will go next to Vinay Misquith with ISI. 
Vinay Misquith: The first question is on pensions, just wanted to clarify that there is no impact on cash paid for pensions.
Mike Bischoff: It is a very limited impact on cash not material to the organization. I think that’s $9 million or $10 million.
Dan Glaser: I indicated it in 2014 our contributions into the pension plans were roughly 180 million and we're expecting this year for it to be roughly 190 million.
Vinay Misquith : Okay. What level of interest rates should we see that would take the contributions higher?
Dan Glaser: What we are going to do is the pension issue of one year at a time. I'm hoping that’s it sort of that you have seven years of fam and seven years of fees to them ready for my interest fees at some point. So bear in mind what generally when something a headwind for you and is macro it can turn around and become a tail wind and it could last for a long period of time. And so obviously the many analysts how are much more experts and I for several year have been predicting movement towards higher interest rate. And there is been significant amount of macro factors that have inhibited that move. But ultimately we feel over time that interest rates over several years are more likely to higher than lower. But Mike you have anything to add.
Mike Bischoff : And Dan I would start with you’re the same promise that you did which is we will only deal with it year by year. But as I said there is many factors that go into the issues with regards to not only pension expense but with regards to funding requirements and one of the main things is our assets and however assets done. And the nice thing that our asset performance last year was very substantial growing not only in the U.S but very strongly in the UK and around the world. And so we had very good asset performance. So not withstanding that what happens is the liability goes up with regards to interest rates most at the end of the year which we think to some extent is transitory of course many firms now six years and over a low interest rate environment would use the word transitory. I wonder what deterioration of that would be. But that said is really with regards to the asset level and the performance. But based upon what we're seeing today we're not anticipating a more change in our cash contribution into the pension plans but as Dan said we'll take it year by year.
Operator: We'll go to Thomas Mitchell with Miller Tabak.
Thomas Mitchell : My first question is -- I think it would probably be for Scott. And that is, there's been a tremendous amount of turmoil in the European banking sector over the last number of years but more recently -- the Italians are apparently going to reorganize totally and so forth. Is that something that either represents an opportunity or has already represented a significant opportunity for the Consulting side? And if it has, how does it look from here? 
Dan Glaser: Well you're right Tom that is probably on the consulting side geared more to Scott then to Julio, Scott you want to take that question.
Scott McDonald : Yes I guess I just make a couple of points some. But the first is I mean I think there will be continued restructuring in the European banking sector and hopefully as they strength in each of the domestic and overall regional banking markets that will help support some growth in the Europe in the future. I think it has already represented a significant opportunity for us because we do work with the private and public sector and we've been heavily involved in the restructuring of the industry. And it will continue to represent a significant opportunity for us in the future. I don’t expect that to change for a number of years. So this is going to take a long time to restructure the sector.
Thomas Mitchell : Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. Then a separate kind of follow-up is that -- is there something not similar to that at all, but separately are you seeing interest in the US banking sector -- either coming from foreign interest or domestic -- that would indicate an increase in either restructuring or M&A activity? 
Dan Glaser: The U.S is a little different in Europe and they restructured earlier in the crisis and it's a more stable system now I think with less solvency and capital issues. But it's a factor that has most of you on the call no enormous growth challenges in the years ahead. So I think there will be it won't be what necessary in Europe which is wholesale restructuring of the banking sector. But here there is got to be refinement for the banking model and that could involve people from outside the U.S or from inside the U.S but it also represents a pretty big opportunity for us.
Operator: We'll go to Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. 
Paul Newsome : Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to know if we've seen any changes in the structure of contingent commissions recently, under the thesis that typically when you start to see a softer market those structures change in terms of what they reward, whether it be profit-sharing versus growth versus new products. Any changes that you've seen yet? 
Dan Glaser : I'll speak broadly and then hand over to Peter. I would look at this subject more broadly as carrier revenue streams. And there's always certain parts of our company where we actually earn contingent commission, but clearly there's carrier revenue streams for all brokers in multiple countries. The most important thing around carrier revenue streams is principles around them of putting clients' interest first and being transparent, so Peter you have something to add.
Peter Zaffino: Yes Dan there has not been much change in terms of the question on contingents or insurer revenue. As you said, we have been working very hard at Marsh to lead the industry in transparency and disclosure, and avoid business practices that have conflicts of interest. So we have not seen any increases or demands of changing how insurer revenue remunerates brokers.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Paul any other question?
Paul Newsome : Almost an accounting question. Does it matter financially with any of your debt covenants or anything in regard the book value impact of pension and FX that runs through, versus the cash and the GAAP EPS impact? 
Dan Glaser: We'll follow it up to make sure we give you a precise answer with Keith, but nothing that I'm aware of. Next question operator.
Operator: And we'll go to Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Mike Nannizzi: Thank you. Just one question; most of my questions were answered. But the Investments Consulting business within Mercer, that's been growing, underlying double digit for some time now. Can you talk about: what is your expectation there? What's driving that? Is it some of the pension items, or something else that we just generally see in the market? How should we be thinking about that line? Thanks. 
Dan Glaser: Sure, so Julio.
Julio Portalatin: Growth this quarter for investments was driven by new money from clients' wins and market performance for greater regulatory oversight and governance requirement it also led to increased demand for de-risking advice, insurance company buyout solutions and implementation advice. So we did cross the 100 billion mark of assets under management in the third quarter and we ended the year over 115 billion in assets under management, so the equity market obviously also help us as some of that is on a fee-based and in relation to the performance, but I will also say that we monitor that very carefully so we can control volatility and much of our growth also comes on a fix-fee basis.  And we have a pretty robust investment business across the globe, it's not just in the U.S. right it's about one-third of it that actually ends up being our financial services business in Australia, about one-third of it is investment consultancy which is mostly in the U.S. and Europe and then we have the investment management business which you're referring to onto the assets under management. So we continue to have a pretty robust growth trajectory there, good mix in business growing with great ambition for the future, we'll continue to invest as well.
Dan Glaser: Mike, any other question?
Mike Nannizzi: Thanks. Yes, so just one follow-up, Dan, I guess, on the capital management front. The one thing I remember you mentioned from Investor Day -- I thought it was a very earnest comment about you're an operator, you've come into the role of CEO, and thinking about deployment and managing capital and using earnings, buybacks relative to earnings. Now the one thing where Marsh is very different than others is very high interest coverage, very, very low leverage. That clearly is a lever. Is that something that may be an evolution as well, as you think about managing for optimization? Maybe, at what point -- and maybe you are already; I'm sure the conversation is happening. But just trying to get an understanding of that. Because it certainly is an outlier relative to others. Thanks. 
Dan Glaser: Yes, sure. Most leaders are outliers on one basis to another you don’t get to be great by following a path and so we do set our own path at Marsh & McLennan and part of that path is we're a balanced organization when you look at our return of capital to shareholders it's via acquisitions and growing our company for the betterment of shareholders and clients and colleagues overtime through repurchases and through dividends and so you will see us deploying more levels of capital and as Mike indicated the 2.3 billion that we did last year will almost certainly be higher in 2015 than it was in 2014 so we're very much committed to returning capital to shareholders and but also a very balanced organization in terms of our strategy and our thinking of the ways that we return that capital so I'd hope that answers your question Mike. Operator I think that might actually do it and let's -- we could take one more question I think other than that I think the conference should be over.
Operator: And so we do have a follow-up question from Larry Greenberg with Janney Capital.
Larry Greenberg: Thanks for the color, just on the FX being most impactful in the first quarter. It seems intuitive that it would almost be like a straight-line projection downward in terms of how impactful it will be over the course of 2015. Is that a fair assumption?
Daniel Glaser: No it's not because it really is a mix of business issue. As an example if you look at RIS some of the European renewals happened in January and January 1 is the biggest date of the year in Continental Europe, June 30th is the biggest date of the year in Australia and so it does vary on that basis although the largest portion of the impact would happen in the first quarter. But Mike do you have something to add. 
Mike Bischoff : Yes just had additional color as Dan said approximately half of the impact will be felt in the first quarter for the reasons that Dan articulated. And then if you look at over the course of the entire year whereas risk and insurance services will feel it most dramatically in the first quarter, over a course of entire year consulting will feel it a little bit more than risk and insurance services. So we will get through the big year-over-year headwind in the first quarter and then it will tail off a bit but it will still be fairly robust against us but like I said about half of it in the first quarter. 
Dan Glaser: And operator and all those on the call thank you for joining us on the call this morning. I just want to reaffirm that I am tremendously optimistic about our future, our core operations are very strong, I feel privileged to lead this great company and I would like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. Thank you. 
Operator: And that does conclude today’s conference call. We thank you for your participation, have a good day.

I'd also like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs, Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter, Julio Portalatin of Mercer and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman Group. Also with us is Keith Walsh of Investor Relations. We live in an age of risk and uncertainty. Two years ago the world was reading about the eurozone crisis escalating tensions in the Middle East. The possible effects of climate change and the North East US was bracing for Superstorm Sandy. Today, recent headlines include cyber security, Ebola fears, healthcare cause and pension volatility to name a few. Our clients face greater challenges than ever before as they try to anticipate and react to what lies ahead. Across the spectrum of global companies, we believe Marsh & McLennan is uniquely positioned to advice clients around the issues of risk, strategy and people.  We have many positive attributes including, a tremendous depth of talent in our colleague base, a collaborative and cohesive culture, market leading positions and a proven management team. In this uncertain environment, there should continue to be strong demand for our services and capabilities, which we believe will produce the same growth in revenue and earnings while we continue to reinvest in our businesses. We also have balance sheet flexibility and believe we’re well positioned to profit from a variety of market conditions.  Moving to our results, in the third quarter, the company delivered its 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share. MMC’s revenue growth was 7% with all operating companies contributing. This performance was achieved both organically and through our strategy of executing on quality acquisitions. On an underlying basis, revenue expanded 5%. This growth exceeded the increase in underlying operating expenses for the 16th consecutive quarter. This ongoing record of consistent performance drove our adjusted margin up 50 basis points to 14.6%, our highest third quarter margin in more than a decade.  Adjusted operating income rose 11%, while adjusted EPS grew 22%, extending our record of double-digit EPS growth to 13 quarters.  Looking at risk and insurance services, revenue increased 7% to $1.6 billion or 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 6% to $242 million, notwithstanding the impact of increased hiring at Guy Carpenter and the negative effects of foreign exchange both of which we highlighted last quarter. Marsh’s revenue increased 8% to $1.3 billion or 5% on an underlying basis. This was an outstanding performance, reflecting balance growth across geographies. The international division increased 5%, matching a strong average annual growth rate over the past five years. Latin America with growth of 11%, reported its eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Asia Pacific rose 5% and EMEA grew 4%. Underlying growth in the US/Canada division was 4%.  Marsh's revenue growth was driven by strong new business, particularly in countries such as the US, Canada, UK, Brazil and Peru. Guy Carpenter delivered 3% underlying revenue growth in the third quarter, its highest of the year. This is a good performance, considering the ongoing rate reductions in many lines and increased retentions of risk by clients. Solid new business and penetration beyond our larger clients produced higher revenue in the quarter. Revenue growth was driven by the US, continental Europe, UK Facultative and Global Specialties such as marine and aviation. In Consulting, revenue increased 7% to $1.5 billion or 6% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income reached $274 million, up 19% from the prior year. And the segment’s margin expanded 180 basis points, to 17.8%, the best in over 30 years. Mercer’s revenue increased 4% to $1.1 billion or 3% on an underlying basis with all major geographies contributing. When viewed by line of business, growth continues to be driven by investments, which expanded 10% and by Health, up 4%. Two weeks ago, we provided an update on the excellent progress of Mercer Marketplace. Over 240 companies have chosen our exchange for their active and retiree solutions with approximately 40 new clients to Mercer health and benefits. These relationships cover 500,000 employees and retirees and provide exchange assets for a total of more than one million lives. This represents nearly five times the reach of Mercer Marketplace when compared with last year. Oliver Wyman continued to deliver outstanding results in the third quarter with revenue expanding 18% to $429 million. This reflects excellent underlying growth of 16%, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter. We anticipate that Oliver Wyman’s growth will moderate in the fourth quarter. The growth in the third quarter was driven by balance performance across industry groups with particular strength in financial services and geographic strength in North America and Europe. In summary, we produced outstanding third quarter results and we remain well positioned to deliver on the long-term goals we committed to at Investor Day in March. Growth in revenue, long-term EPS growth of 13%, increasing cash flows, and return of capital to shareholders through reducing the share count and double-digit dividend growth.  With that, let me turn it over to Mike.
J. Michael Bischoff:  Thank you, Dan and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, Marsh & McLennan’s revenue increased 7% to $3.1 billion, or a 5% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 11% to $458 million, and the adjusted margin rose 50 basis points to 14.6%. GAAP EPS increased 20% to $0.54 and adjusted EPS rose 22% to $0.56, so another outstanding quarter both from a revenue growth and earnings standpoint. Investment income, investment income was $26 million in the third quarter, including $24 million of carried interest in Trident III. We expect that the investment income in the fourth quarter should be de minimis.  We had highlighted on our second quarter earnings call that any investment income that may occur in the last half of the year would most likely be offset by corporate initiatives, including strengthening our cyber security protections, expenses related to strategic investments, and transformation efforts, primarily within HR and finance. Approximately half of the investment income in the third quarter was offset by these initiatives, brining third quarter corporate expense to $58 million. The level of spending in the fourth quarter for corporate initiatives should be similar to the amount spent this quarter. Foreign exchange, as expected the negative effects of foreign exchange on risk and insurance services continued in the third quarter and most likely foreign exchange will negatively impact the fourth quarter as well. Mercer completed its investment in Alexander Forbes in early October. As previously announced, Mercer’s investment of approximately $300 million consists of two tranches, 15% last July when Alexander Forbes completed its initial public offering and approximately 19% in early October following the completion of customary regulatory approvals. This transaction will be accounted for under the equity method and reported on a one-quarter lag basis. Accordingly in the fourth quarter, we will include the initial 15% share of Alexander Forbes’ earnings, net of tax and amortization.  Beginning in the first quarter of next year, the full 34% ownership will be reflected as net revenue in Mercer’s operating results.  Debt, in early September, we issued $800 million of debt, including $300 million of 2.35% five-year senior notes and $500 million of 3.5% ten and a half year senior notes. In early October, we used the proceeds to pay down $630 million of future debt obligations, including $230 million that was due to mature next September and $400 million due in 2019. Expenses of 135 million for the early extinguishment of this debt were approximately $0.17 per share will be shown as a discreet item on our fourth quarter income statement. This expense will be excluded from our adjusted results in the fourth quarter. The recent debt refinancing allowed us to take advantage of low interest rates, extended the maturity of our overall debt portfolio, lowered our annual interest expense and reduced future refinancing risk. As our next bond maturity of $250 million is not due until April 2017. We have now completed the reshaping of our debt maturity ladder that began three years ago. At the end of last year debt on our balance sheet was $3 billion with an average interest rate of 5.1%. Today our debt outstanding is $3.4 billion with an average interest rate of 3.9%.  Cash utilization, cash was $2.65 billion at the end of the third quarter including the $800 million debt financing in September. Approximately $1.8 billion was held internationally. As I just discuss, $765 million was used to pay down the two debt maturities in early October. Cash utilized in the third quarter included $154 million for dividends, a $173 million for acquisitions and investments including Mercer’s initial investment in Alexander Forbes of a $137 million and $250 million to repurchase $4.8 million shares. This marks the tenth consecutive quarter of share buy backs.  Through nine months, cash deployed included $612 million for acquisitions and investments, $600 million to repurchase $11.8 million shares and $429 million for dividends. In total we have utilized more than $1.6 billion for dividends, acquisitions and share repurchase this year. This certainly has us on track to reach our target of $2.1 billion for the year.  At the end of the third quarter shares outstanding declined to $542 million from $547 million at the end of last year. In the third quarter the quarterly dividend increased 12% with the board having authorized the fourth quarter dividend of $0.28. Annual dividends per share this year will grow 10.4%. Clearly we’re delivering on our Investor Day commitments to reduce the share count every year and to increase dividends by double-digits on an annual basis.  Lastly I would like to reiterate what Dan said earlier. Our results in the third quarter were outstanding continuing the excellent performance we have achieved throughout the first nine months of this year.  With that I’m happy to turn it back to Dan. 
Daniel S. Glaser:  Thank you, Mike and operator we are ready to begin the Q&A. 
Operator:
 : Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) I’m going to take our first question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan – Wells Fargo Securities:  Hi, good morning. I was hoping to start off by spending I guess little more time on what you’re seeing within more specifically on the organic revenue growth side. It picked up in the US and Canada in this quarter, can you just comment a little bit more about what’s driving that and also what you’re seeing in terms of the pricing environment on the primary side and just your expectations I guess for the organic growth there in Q4 and maybe looking forward to some initial indications for 2015.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thanks, Elyse. It’s Dan. Let me just start by talking about the overall company for a little bit, I mean clearly we’re happy with the growth. The quarter was 5% for Marsh & McLennan Companies and year-to-date is also 5%. Within this and as we’ve said before each OPCO is different, some have more headwinds than others. If I look at both March, Marsh’s 4% year-to-date, Mercer’s 3% year-to-date, Guy Carpenter at 1% and Oliver Wyman at 15% and that mix taken together gives us our 5%. I would still bracket us though in a 3% to 5% organic growth world. I think that’s really where the performance has been and there’s a lot of uncertainty out there. So generally when we’re looking at our planning cycle and how we run the business and how we prepare for investments etcetera, it’s anticipating that we’re still on a 3% to 5% organic growth world, but Peter you want to talk about Marsh specifically. 
Peter Zaffino:  Sure, Dan. Thanks, Elyse for the question. Let me start by just giving you an overview on what happened in the quarter for Marsh. Again the 5% underlying revenue growth really proud of, it’s the eighteenth consecutive quarter for us of organic growth. It was very balanced across the world, so we had all major geographies from international contributing and as you mentioned US and Canada did quite well too, with 4%. What drove that really was a lot of fundamentals. We had improved renewal revenue retention as well as client retention, so that contributed more in international than in the US and Canada because US and Canada had 1% growth at this time last year. But in the United States and Canada, we had terrific new business in the quarter. We had 13% growth year-over-year in new business. All the businesses that are in the US and Canada division did contribute to the top line, so when I look across the world, really pleased and proud of the performance, but it really was the fundamentals in executing across the world, which generate the revenue growth. 
Daniel S. Glaser: Any other question Elyse?
Elyse Greenspan – Wells Fargo Securities: Yes and then just in terms of Mercer Marketplace and the healthcare exchange enrollment, I know you mentioned the 500,000 employees that you have in your exchange this year. How would you in terms of describe I guess the headwind in terms of just the number of companies I guess that you spoke to and those that shows to join your exchange and maybe was there a difference what you saw this year versus last year. Also if there were some companies I guess that showed kind of wade – and make wade and not on your exchange this year, was that more that they were just holding off on their decision for another year or people just decided not to pursue a private health exchange entirely and on. One last question just based on the enrollment figures that you saw this year and a strong growth, do you expect to start to generate positive earnings from your healthcare exchange when we look out to 2015. Thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thanks, Elyse. That’s a hell of a question. So let me start by first giving some kudos to Julio and the team. We’re very pleased with the early results of Mercer Marketplace. Now, Julio and the Mercer leadership team recognize the opportunity and they created a strategy to develop a comprehensive exchange capability that is user friendly, dynamic and flexible. They’re now executing on that strategy and we expect this to be a big business for us someday and eventually a solid contributor to the results of Mercer’s U.S. H&B business. However, from an MMC perspective let me just say, we really aren’t counting on any meaningful contribution to MMC’s overall earnings for the foreseeable future. But Julio, little bit more detail please. 
Julio A. Portalatin:  Thank you. Thanks for the question. I really want to set it in context first by talking a little bit about Mercer and where we’ve come in and leading into the Mercer Marketplace and the questions that you ask. We are really pretty pleased with Mercer’s third quarter performance. We were able to once again deliver a solid step forward in financial performance while making good progress on execution of our key strategic priorities and objectives. We produced another solid quarter of earnings growth and margin expansion. Our top line came in as Dan mentioned earlier 4% and then 3% on the underlying basis, up from our growth rate last quarter. We continue to be very actively involved in managing our cost base and investing in new opportunities while being disciplined across the board.  Last quarter we discussed our strategic investment in Alexander Forbes and crossing the $100 billion assets under management mark in our investments business. This quarter we are really pleased with – that we’re able to report significant growth and progress in our exchange solution Mercer Marketplace whether it is the roughly five fold increase in employees or our active exchange the growth in our retiree exchange or the lives that we have access to through delivery of voluntary benefits in individual insurance.  Mercer Marketplace exchange platform on any measure has had a really good sales here and I’m very proud of the team for the work that they’ve done in this regard. Now as we position Marsh’s marketplace today and into the future, we continue to look at covering trends and how and why our clients are being attracted to what we’re offering. But the reality is that we are finding that our exchange solution has a number of key attributes that are very attractive to our client base and prospects.  First, we stand the market and our exchange is available to companies with a few, has a hundred employees and with no real upper limit. Second, we had built in flexibility that many companies find to be of value, insured all self insured medical to find contribution or traditional funding as well as an array of voluntary benefits.  Third, we have a single solution that spans every segment of an employer’s population, from benefit, ineligible to sponsor group plans, to Medicare retirees. And finally, we’ve seen very strong early proof of concept including cost savings and high energy and high employee appreciation of the support they receive from our benefit councils.  So when you speak about why people are so attracted, those are some of the reasons we have seen and we’ve heard from our clients as being the case and it’s a full spectrum attraction and yes, there might be some early movers that are more likely to be considered in that middle market space, but we already are seeing for 2015 early adapters on the large market space and that’s been a lot of competition most recently as well. So this is an evolving platform. It’s an evolving business and we continue to lead and we expect to continue to be in that leading position for a long time to come.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Julio. Well, that answer certainly matched the question. Next question, please, operator.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan – Morgan Stanley: Good morning and thank you for taking my call. So first question on the Guy Carpenter, the reinsurance brokerage actually, the organic growth 3% is very strong relative to the market condition. So on that, I just wonder your thoughts on – in the near term, what do you see the upcoming January renewal pricing and what could potentially impact on your business? And then on longer term if you think the change in the marketplace to see if there's more alternative capital and the primary company probably either ceding less to reinsurance market. So what's your – how do you adapt to the changing market there?
Daniel S. Glaser :  Thanks, Kai Pan. So Alex, Bischoff comment about your growth and then looking a little bit further, what’s the potential impact of alternative capital.
Alexander S. Moczarski : Yeah, so we’re really pleased about the third quarter 3% underlying growth is pretty good given the circumstances. On top of 5% growth the same quarter last year. How are we doing it? I think we are executing – I believe we are executing our strategic plan well. Our book of business has improved from the point of view of its robustness. We have less reliance on the very, very large clients that we still have, but we would rely on a lot go back five years. Bear in mind actually this is now I think its 23 quarters where we haven’t gone backwards organically, only one quarter we were flat the rest have shown organic growth. So we have – we do lean forward, which I think is good.  Our book of business has moved to being more of a recurring book of business as we’ve done less transactional business in like Quill and other one-off products, as well as moving into our segments such as the mutual, the excess and surplus where they’re slightly smaller clients or oftentimes much smaller clients, but they need us and so I feel pretty good about our book.  I feel pretty good about the way we are focusing on growth areas such as accident and health, cyber, and also around innovate – innovation is really how Guy Carpenter was founded, the base on which Guy Carpenter was founded and we continue to innovate and I’m pretty happy about the pipeline of new services and new client base in technology that we’ll be coming out with over the coming year. So we continue to lean forward. We’ve got, I believe, the best team in the business. We listen, we learn, we provide advice, we have insights and we look after our clients and I think without being arrogant and complacent that we continue to do that will maintain our relevance in there for our value.  Going forward around pricing, it makes – you kind of hear every now and then, we are bouncing along the bottom and then you get surprised by further reductions in pricing. We will see. We will see. We are – we’ve had adverse wins for a long time and we continue to be able to eke out growth and we hope to be able to do so going forward. That’s something within our plans.  And really that – so as far as alternative capital is concerned, we are agnostic to capital, we need to understand it. We need to make sure that our clients have free access to the best advices as regards where to go, who to rely on and that’s what we are working on. There will be – there’s some talk every now and then about this intermediation I think as long as lots of options and we're on our game we stand to be in good stead.
Daniel S. Glaser : Thanks, Alex. Next question operator. 
Kai Pan – Morgan Stanley: Thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser : Thank you, Kai Pan. Next question operator.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Larry Greenberg with Janney Capital.
Larry Greenberg – Janney Capital: Good morning and thank you. I’m just wondering if we had turned back to the exchange and who – can you just elaborate a little bit on your strategy in the retiree market. I know you had decent growth there, but it seems like it’s moving more slowly certainly than the employee numbers. So I am just wondering where you see yourself positioned relative to the competition there and any other comments you might have on that? Thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser: So Julio, specific comments on the retiree exchange and our capability for retirees.
Julio A. Portalatin: Okay. Thanks, thanks, Larry. From the beginning, our exchange strategy has been to use the strength of our organization and creativity to put together the most flexible and comprehensive offering in the market and we are well positioned to continue to do that. It’s obvious that the largest piece of the opportunity lies in the active space, all right, where there is 165 million employees, who are receiving their medical benefits through their employers and if you were to prioritize where you want to stand a lot of your early time certainly there in positioning yourself not just early, but for this long marathon run, you certainly want to do it then and that’s where we’re focus. Now, having said that, as you know we did make an acquisition with Transition Assist, we do have a continued investment in the call center capabilities and the technology capabilities for that sector and we will get our fair share of that business as we continue to grow and as always you have to continue to prioritize and reprioritize as the opportunity presents itself and we will continue to invest.
Daniel S. Glaser: That’s a great answer. So our priority initially has been on the active space. We are still in the retiree market and we are in there swinging, but our focus has been more on actives than on retirees at this stage. Any other question Larry?
Larry Greenberg – Janney Capital: Yeah, just numbers question. I know you are – the number for your – of Marsh employees that were included in actives, was there – were there any Marsh retirees in the retiree bucket?
Julio A. Portalatin: The answer is yes. There were Marsh retirees and it’s about 2600.
Larry Greenberg – Janney Capital: Great. Thanks very much.
Julio A. Portalatin: It’s about 20,000 on the active side.
Daniel S. Glaser : Yeah, so 20000 on the active side for Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Julio A. Portalatin: Yeah, it’s about 20,000 on the active side and retirees –
Daniel S. Glaser :  That’s 2600 retirees for Marsh. Perfect.
Larry Greenberg – Janney Capital: Great, thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser :  Next question, please.
Operator: And we will go next to Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.
Dan Farrell – Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Hi and good morning. Just a free cash and sort of near-term sort of cash flow question, the debt pay down in the fourth quarter would seem to be using a lot of the U.S. cash and I’m wondering if that means anything from a short-term perspective on buyback?
Daniel S. Glaser :  Okay. So Mike, you want to handle that question.
J. Michael Bischoff : Yeah and good morning Dan, thank you for the question. You are absolutely right as we manage our cash needs across the year, we have to take into account the seasonality of the needs, any acquisitions, obviously the dividend payments that we make, but then the appetite we have for share repurchase, and as you know from our Investor Day in March of this year, we’re anticipating a fairly significant amount and level of a share repurchase throughout the entire year. I think it was 600 million through the first three quarters and we certainly are planning to continue to do that through the fourth quarter.  Specifically to your question, the U.S. cash and the international cash, we typically build our cash positions throughout the company in the second half of the year and work them up towards our bonus payments that occur at the end of February of the following year. So looking at this year, we basically utilized our cash in the first quarter and then we began to build it up and that will continue to build up through the fourth quarter. But specifically on repatriation, we have not done that much repatriation of our international excess funds into the US through the first three quarters. We are planning to begin to do that more so in the fourth quarter, as well as in the first quarter in anticipation of the bonus payments, as I said, at the end of February of 2015.
Daniel S. Glaser : Thanks, Mike. Dan any other question?
Dan Farrell – Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Just one quick one on reinsurance, you guys have made a lot of hires and investments in the reinsurance business this year. Have you seen any benefit from those hires yet in the revenues? Or is that something that could be coming through down the road? Thanks.
J. Michael Bischoff: Yeah, so a couple of things on that, first of all, most of the hiring was last year as opposed to this year but we are still very alive to the opportunity that Guy Carpenter has as a premier provider in the space to hire more people now or in the future. So – and in terms of – I always shy away from those types of questions and answers that I hear across the space about production, people and production talents and what they would generally produce. We are a content company. Our job is to build the skills and capabilities of the organization. And when we hire people, we are largely hiring them to serve existing clients and we expect that our great service of existing clients will lead to more opportunities on that business and on perspective business on new clients in the future but it’s never a calculation for us as to we are hiring these people and we are hoping they create revenue this amount this year and certain amount the following year after that. So we are building capabilities as opposed to sales capacity per se. It’s sales based upon content capability. Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you very much.
Daniel S. Glaser : Okay. Next question, please.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Thank you. On the risk and insurance services segment for the year-to-date, it’s 3% organic revenue growth and 5% operating profit growth. I’m trying to get a sense of whether at some point we should expect that profit growth to accelerate and if there are any headwinds currently, if you can outline those that will be helpful too? Thanks.
J. Michael Bischoff : Jay, this is Mike. I think on an adjusted basis, it was 6% year-to-date. I just want to make sure that in operating income growth, make sure everyone has the correct facts. Okay, but your question is still right considering that we’ve been delivering across MMC double-digit adjusted operating income growth for quite a period of time now. I think that we are in our sixth straight year of double-digit adjusted operating income growth for the company. We look at what we’ve said before that 3% is – 3% organic growth is sort of the sweet spot for the company and then when we grow above 3%, it’s easier for us to not only drive adjusted operating income growth but also margin as well. And clearly when you look on a year-to-date basis, Guy Carpenter year-to-date has grown 1%, which basically means we are not looking for any margin expansion from Guy Carpenter and in fact we’ll spend any amount of money to protect the franchise and build the franchise for the future.  And so underneath the covers, you can pretty much imagine that Guy Carpenter is having a year where we’re treading water at best on a margin basis and margin is still rocketing forward and that overall arrives in a result. And so when we look forward into the future, we live as we were mentioning earlier in a tremendously uncertain environment with a lot of moving parts. But I don’t think there is a finer risk and insurance services organization in the world nor finer risk and insurance services leadership team, so I would bet on us in terms of being able to optimize whatever value is available in the world with respect to risk and insurance services.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Okay and then on a separate topic, there were a number of changes announced in the financial function across company, I was wondering if you could touch on those in terms of how we should be thinking about that?
Daniel S. Glaser :  Sure. Well, I mean, we have – we’ve had a number of changes on the colleague front across the organization and within Marsh, Mercer specifically we’ve had a number of announcements of management moves and management changes and clearly you’ve seen some things that we’ve done on the function side where we’ve announced that both Marsh and Mercer are getting new CFOs and Mark McGivney has moved from Marsh into a corporate function. We have a very strong finance function and we are just positioned in ourselves to optimize that financial function for the benefit of the overall firm. And generally when we are making these moves, finance or otherwise, it shows the health of the organization and I was very excited to see particularly in Marsh and Mercer recently with several of the announcements that have been made giving high quality people who are a big part of our future, new opportunities to hone and test and develop their skills.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Okay. So it’s all being done for position and strength?
Daniel S. Glaser : Absolutely.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: All right. Thanks, Dan.
Daniel S. Glaser :  Next question.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields – Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. Dan, can you talk a little bit about whether you are seeing signs of, I guess, or what signs you are seeing of possible global economic slowdown?
Daniel S. Glaser : Sure. Why don’t I start with that and then I’ll move it around the table so each of the operating company CEOs can give some commentary on it. But as I mentioned in the script, I really do believe we are living in unprecedented times, essentially in Asia, risk and uncertainty. It’s also in Asia relentless acceleration. Opportunities and challenges develop faster than any point that I’ve seen in my career. Over the past few years, the world has seemingly traded a set of financial concerns whether that’s global growth, financial stability, unemployment, or a new set of financial and economic concerns, which is less about stability and less about unemployment and more about growth.  And so you’re reading now a lot of growth concerns whether that’s with regard to continental Europe, the developing market, particularly China, et cetera. And the looming potential threat of recession or even deflation in certain economies and into all of that economic bucket is a set of political and geopolitical concerns that we just haven’t seen really until the last couple of years. And so then, I guess, you could add to the mix discreet items such as Ebola or cyber attacks and it creates quite a mixture of concern for us. I mean, from our perspective being so well positioned around the world and in 130 different countries, issue on an economy basis, if you are talking macro, really it’s about continental Europe more than any other factor because as we have mentioned before, if we look at Europe including the UK, it’s about a third of our business. UK is about a half of that.  So you’re still talking about continental Europe representing 16, 17% of our business. If you recall in mid 2013, so not too long ago, about a year ago, most economists became cautiously optimistic about European prospect and believing that GDP had dwarfed. We still seem to be bouncing around the bottom as far as we concern – as we are concerned. When we look at the data points month-to-month, it’s very consistent. It’s one step forward, two steps back, two steps forward, one step back, particularly in continental Europe. It’s clear that relative to the US and the UK continental Europe is choppier and has a more uncertain economic environment. In the past, insurance has acted kind of as a lagging indicator and consulting has pretty much been a forward indicator in terms of business activity and confidence but why don’t I stop there and just move it around the table and get some commentary. Scott, you want to kick this off?
Scott McDonald : Yeah, good morning Meyer. I’ll try and give you a little bit of insight from what we are seeing on the demand for consulting, which has done sometimes at least as a leading indicator. In the US, there is nothing surprising. The US economy remains relatively slow but there is growth, there is still business confidence there and we’ve got a very robust and – for consulting across almost all sectors of the economy. So that hasn’t changed.  In Europe, you all have the data and clearly there is an enormous slowdown in Europe on the economic side. We still don’t see that on the consulting side of the business, so at least in Oliver Wyman, where we’ve got – it isn’t as robust as in the US, but it’s still strong demand and again it’s across all sectors ranging from manufacturing to financial services. So it’s not focused on a specific part of the economy.  I think that must be a lag because the economy has slowed down so much there. I would expect that had some impact on our demand. It’s hard to imagine how it couldn’t. One bit of good news on Europe, I’m sure you’re all aware of is the ECB completed their asset quality review and stress test over the weekend.  Oliver Wyman supported them with that work and we do hope that will now provide some more confidence in the banking system and may provide some impetus for growth in Europe we will see. And then outside North America and Europe, it’s mixed across the world. We are definitely seeing some weaker growth everywhere but nothing severe and again it hasn’t fed through into consulting demand which remains strong in almost all markets with maybe the possible exception of Latin America.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Scott. Will it stay in the consulting segment for now and Julio, give us some commentary please.
Julio A. Portalatin: Yeah, a lot of what Scott mentioned certainly applies to some of our business for sure. I mean, in general we are pretty bullish on the U.S. in terms of our value proposition solutions. Pipelines were good. We continue to see demand for our very large set of solutions. Little bit tempered just about everywhere else, give-or-take, we see a certain market slowdown in Europe. Now in our case about 50% of our European business is out of the UK.  The UK is fairing slightly better than the rest of the continent, but of course, it’s not going to be immune if the continent continues to slow down, but we are seeing a demand for our services and pipeline improvement in the UK. It’s kind of stabilization of pipeline in Germany, a little bit of an improvement in some other parts of the continent. We’ll see if that actually results in revenue increasing. But when everything is said and done, even if we do see a bit of a softer side on the revenue side, we are seeing earnings growth this year and we expect that we will be able to position ourselves for continued earnings growth even in a slowing revenue environment.
Daniel S. Glaser:  Thanks, Julio. Peter?
Peter Zaffino: Try not to be repetitive, I think the economic factors that really drive insurance in terms of growth, total insured value, sales, payroll, employee count, are all growing – growing modestly across the world. So it’s fairly balanced and a little bit of a tailwind that that’s offsetting some of the pricing. As Dan highlighted, if we look at continental Europe, again we are cautiously optimistic that we are in a stable environment, but if I look at our revenue growth in the quarter, we had 33 countries that generated more than 10% organic growth, a 11 of those came from continental Europe, so third of our growth, so it’s encouraging. I want to be cautiously optimistic, but we are in a fairly stable environment. So overall I don’t see a material impact and that contributing to the slowdown.
Daniel S. Glaser: Alex, do you have anything to add. 
Alexander S. Moczarski: Just to say that – you mentioned the Ebola and cyber, Ebola, we've brushed off our SARS files and we're looking to be able to relate it with the time when SARS came out and so we have our working party on that, so I view that as a side opportunity. Cyber we are certainly seeing opportunity there. As it gets tougher to grow, we are seeing more demand for our strategic advisory help, so in general, we are still I believe, on the wake internationally and I think given that this opportunity to grow, so I’ve remained cautiously optimistic.
Daniel S. Glaser: So Meyer, I hope that wasn’t too much for you, but that’s our take on the macro question.
Meyer Shields – Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: No, that was outstanding and if I could just throw one numbers question to Mike, do we have a sense yet of corporate expenses in terms of run rate for 2015?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yeah, I will just take that. Our expectation would be our corporate expense in 2015 would revert back to something akin to the 45 million or so per quarter. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.
Daniel S. Glaser : Next question, please.
Operator: And we will go next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Joshua D. Shanker – Deutsche Bank AG: Yeah, good morning everyone.
Daniel S. Glaser: Good morning.
Joshua D. Shanker – Deutsche Bank AG: If I look at the pledged capital deployment shareholders for 2014, you guys talked about 2.1 billion and said it probably wouldn’t be lower than that for 2015. Obviously net operating profits are lower than that right now and they will be for a few years I assume. I’m not asking for a long-term capital deployment plan, but when you guys think about your strategy, are you going to grow into that $2.1 billion number over multi-years or do you think the capital return to shareholders is inflated over the near-term?
Daniel S. Glaser: I’ll absolutely – I’ll start with that and then hand it to Mike. We absolutely believe that we will continue to grow our adjusted operating income and our cash flow will grow even faster is our expectation over the course of our three or four-year planning cycle. And when we spoke at Investor Day and made a commitment to $2.1 billion or [they are about] (ph) for 2014 and that 2015 would be similar to that. Our position on that has not changed and then I’ll hand over to Mike who will fill you in some of the details on how we would arrive on that kind of number for 2015.
J. Michael Bischoff : Well, thank you, Dan. And Josh, excellent question, and as Dan indicated, there is a number of premises with regard to our commitment to investors. The first premise and something that we’ve shared with investors is for many years our free cash flow was basically diverted into other activities. But starting several years ago and currently and going forward, that free cash flow is available for reinvestment in the business, acquisitions, capital expenditures, it’s in return on capital of the shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends. So when we looked at 2014, we had a few things going on.  First we had a very high level of cash going into the year more than just on a seasonal basis and our intent was to utilize our excess cash over the course of 2014, which we have been doing and we will continue to do. Then the second thing which is one premise of your question then is, well, is that all there is and what does that mean for the implications going forward? Well, as Dan indicated and we would like to anticipate, we plan on very healthy increases in our free cash flow going into next year and continuing.  The third thing has to do with debt capacity and we came into this year with $3 billion of debt on our balance sheet and we have $3.4 billion as it stands today. We feel our credit metrics have improved over the last three, four years and in fact, we think that the credit metrics will continue to improve over the next two to four years. However, it also means that within that improvement of credit metrics basically because of earnings growth, we feel we have a little bit more capacity to grow our debt. So overall, it’s a combination of utilizing our excess cash, little bit higher debt levels, but mainly the core of it is very strong operating earnings, very strong cash flow, and the growth of that cash flow.
Daniel S. Glaser : Any other questions, Josh.
Joshua D. Shanker – Deutsche Bank AG: Yeah, just a quick one. On the last conference call, you said we might want to expect there could be some investment income from Trident coming through, but generally that would probably be offset by incremental corporate initiative expenses. Did we see the corporate initiative expenses this quarter? Does that mean that margins are slightly depressed or that didn’t happen?
Daniel S. Glaser : Mike, you want to take that?
J. Michael Bischoff: Yeah, thank you, Josh, and I’m sorry if we weren’t clear on that. We did say on the second quarter earnings call that for all intents and purpose is investment income over the last six months of this year would be offset by corporate initiatives.  There is many smaller corporate initiatives, the three larger ones that we spoke to and so when we looked at the third quarter, we had some idea of what investment income would be but we had a very little idea of what fourth quarter would be. Now sitting here at the end of October, we have a fairly clear idea that investment income over the course of the last six months would be in that neighborhood of $26 million. That said the corporate initiatives over the last six months of the year or the additional corporate initiatives will absorb that, about half of it in the third quarter and about half in the fourth quarter.
Joshua D. Shanker – Deutsche Bank AG: And will those corporate initiatives continue into ’15 or there is some sort of inflation of corporate spend right now going on?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes there is a – there is higher levels of corporate spend, which we believe to last on a temporary basis and we don’t expect much of it to continue into 2015.
J. Michael Bischoff:  And you’ll see that all in our corporate line as you did this quarter with corporate expenses being $58 million, as Dan indicated our normal run-rate of corporate expenses is around $45 million. So you saw it very clearly in this quarter and you’ll see it most likely to the same extent in the next quarter. 
Joshua D. Shanker – Deutsche Bank AG:  Thank you and congratulation on the quarter.
J. Michael Bischoff:  Thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser:  Next question operator.
Operator:  We will go next to Vinay Misquith with Evercore.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners Inc: Hi, good morning. The first question is on the pace of margin expansion in consulting, so it seems that Oliver Wyman is probably driving a lot of the pace of margin expansion given the growth, I was curious if that’s true and should we see a slowdown in the pace of growth there because of global slowdown. Should we expect the pace of margin expansion to also slow?
Daniel E. Glaser: Okay, so let me address that. We don’t break out the margins in the – in either segments, I mean the operating companies. We would say that as a leadership team several years ago, we identified consulting’s, margins as an issue for us to address as a leadership team and to get underneath because we thought that with greater levels of financial discipline and sales capability that we could actually drive consulting margins far higher than what they were and so this is not a one year story at all. If you look at it in terms of – in 2012 consulting was up 150 basis points, in 2013 consulting was up 160 basis points and year-to-date consulting is up 170 basis points. So we have had three years of dramatic change in consulting’s margins.  We’re right in the middle of our budgeting and planning cycle for the next several years and so it’s really too early for us to tell, I mean clearly from a margin expansion we will work in both segments to expand margins with higher levels when we have higher levels of organic growth, we will seek to do that. And we expect in both segments over the course of the next three to five years that there’s tremendous opportunity that we have to go out there and execute on which would help our margins. But also as we’ve said many times, we’re not driven by – we don’t have a margin issue in the company, we’re not driven by margin expansion. We’re focused much more on revenue growth, earnings growth and margin expansion is an outcome of having our revenue almost always exceed our expense growth and so that’s our position with regard to margins. Any other question? 
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners Inc: Yes, just on Mercer. What percentage of their business is recurring versus this consulting revenue?
Daniel E. Glaser: Mercer.
Julio A. Portalatin: Okay, so just to clarify, of the consulting segment just keep in mind that Mercer makes up about three quarters of the revenue of the consulting segment, so when you make assessments or some estimates about improvements it would have to be a lot on that side in order for it to happen. So let me clarify that point. Second point is that when everything is said and done, we continue to work hard to improve over a long term our results and we have a sustainable strategy to be able to do that and we will continue to do that as we go forward. 
Daniel E. Glaser: The recurring revenue, how much is –
Julio A. Portalatin: It’s about – it depends on the overall, so the – for Mercer it’s about 70% recurring and 30% project oriented.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners Inc: Thank you.
Daniel E. Glaser: And the next question. I think we have time for one more question. 
Operator: Thank you. We will take that final question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.:  Thank you, just a quick one here on exchanges. Most of my questions were answered. It seems like the investments in exchange are going to offset the margin benefits in the near term. Is there a level of enrollment where margin contribution would outpace the potential for expenses or do you expect that you’ll continue to kind of manage the business that way until you reach scale?
Daniel E. Glaser:  Yeah, so let me address that. I mean, first of all as we’ve said a couple of times, we are in the very early stage of a new business. A business that has dramatic amount of potential for us, but we are also cautious because we’re in such an early stage and we don’t necessarily think that every competitor that could be in this segment is already in the segment. Today at the end of the day business attracts completion and so it’s very hard for us to make any kind of long term assessment.  What I would say is that we really aren’t expecting any earnings contribution and that we will invest whatever money is necessary to position Mercer as one of the leaders eventually in this exchange segment. So on that basis it’s not a situation that that we’re seeking earnings from the exchange segment, we will be recycling any benefits that we get in any kind of short or midterm back into the business as we grow and position ourselves to be one of the leaders.
Michael Steven Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs Group Inc:  Okay, so – I mean, if you think about those investments as you recycle those dollars, I’m guessing that either the ROI or something about investing in the exchange makes that an attractive place to put dollars to work. How about operating margins, if we clear out the infrastructure expenses or investments, is there a way to think about that even relative to your kind of baseline benefits business.
Daniel E. Glaser:  Yeah, Julio you want to take that without getting into details about the margin?
Julio A. Portalatin: Yeah, thank you. I mean our exchange business has the potential to take business for us, we’ve said that before and in near we’re not expecting significant contribution to earnings as Dan said. Longer term, we expect margins on the exchange as we said that the investor meetings that we had back in March, we expect margin of the exchange to be roughly in line with our margins in our health focused business today, which is one of our highest margin businesses that we have in the company. So investment in the rapidly growing business lies, significant ramp up in the administration and that’s why we have an servicing and that’s why you have some early moderation as far as impact on earnings on a positive sense and if sales pace continues modest dilution will happen of course in the earliest, but as we said in 2014 we’ve managed to invest and still deliver great margin and great earnings improvement for the segment. So we’ll continue – meaning the Consulting segment for MMC.
Daniel E. Glaser: Did that take care of it, Mike? 
Michael Steven Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs Group Inc:  Sure, thanks.
Julio A. Portalatin: Okay, thank you.
Daniel E. Glaser: Okay, so I’d like to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning and in particular I’d like to thank our clients for their support and our collogues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. Have a good day everybody.
Operator: And again, that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Second quarter 2014 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind you the remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's most recent SEC filings, which are available on the MMC website for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO. I'd also like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino, Alex Moczarski, Julio Portalatin and Scott McDonald. Also with us this morning is Keith Walsh. MMC continued to deliver excellent financial results in the second quarter. We produced strong revenue growth, meaningful margin improvement and double-digit growth in operating income. We also returned capital to shareholders through increased share repurchase and announced a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend. MMC's revenue growth was 7%, with all operating companies contributing. This level of growth was achieved both organically and through our strategy of executing on quality acquisitions. Revenue grew 5% on an underlying basis. This growth exceeded the increase in underlying operating expenses as it has for 15 consecutive quarters, driving our consolidated adjusted margin of 60 basis points to 19.8%, our highest second quarter in a decade. Adjusted operating income rose 11%. This is the fourth straight year that we increased second quarter earnings by double digits. Looking at our Risk and Insurance Services segment, revenue increased 6% to $1.8 billion or 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 5% to $454 million. The second quarter margin declined slightly to 25.4%. But more importantly, during the first half of the year, the margin increased 20 basis points to 26.3%. For the full year, Risk and Insurance Services remains on track to produce solid underlying revenue growth and meaningful earnings growth as well as deliver slight margin improvement driven by Marsh. Marsh's revenue increased 7% to $1.5 billion or 4% on an underlying basis. All major geographic regions contributed to the strong underlying growth in the quarter. The International division increased 5% as revenue continued to expand throughout Marsh's vast geographic footprint. Latin America, with superb growth of 16%, reported its 7th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Asia Pacific also continued to generate strong growth, rising 9%; EMEA grew 1% in the quarter. In the U.S./Canada division, underlying growth was 3%. Marsh's revenue growth is driven by strong new business growth in Canada, Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America as well as high client retention across the organization. Marsh continues to identify opportunities to enhance global growth through acquisitions. Marsh & McLennan Agency added the largest independent insurance agency in North Carolina. Also in the quarter, we closed 2 other acquisitions in Marsh & McLennan Agency and reached an agreement to acquire a majority stake in Marsh's long-standing correspondent broker in Panama. Guy Carpenter delivered 2% underlying revenue growth in the second quarter despite ongoing rate reductions in many lines. New business wins and penetration beyond our larger clients drove higher revenue in the quarter. While the U.S., Guy Carpenter's largest geography, was essentially flat, revenue growth was driven by international operations reflecting increases in the U.K. Treaty, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Continental Europe. In the Consulting segment, revenue increased 8% to $1.5 billion or 6% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income reached $247 million, an increase of 20% from the prior year. And this segment's margin increased 160 basis points to 16.2%, the best in over 20 years. Mercer's revenue increased 3% to $1.1 billion or 2% on an underlying basis. This increase was spread across all major regions with particular strength from the U.S. and Mercer's growth markets. When viewed by line of business, growth was driven by Investments, which increased 6%; and by Health, up 4%. In June, Mercer announced that it would acquire a 34% stake in South Africa-based Alexander Forbes, a leader in the retirement, investments and employee benefits space in South Africa and broader sub-Saharan Africa. The Alexander Forbes initial public offering was completed last week. This investment is consistent with our strategy of seeking quality businesses with a strong operational and cultural fit that provide geographic expansion opportunities in fast-growing markets. We have a close relationship with the Alexander Forbes management team. You might recall, we purchased its risk and insurance broking operation 2.5 years ago. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the second quarter reached a record $449 million, reflecting outstanding underlying growth of 17%. The results reflect substantial growth in Oliver Wyman's largest practice, Financial Services, and strong growth from consumer and Lippincott. We are very pleased with Oliver Wyman's first half underlying revenue growth of 14%. In the second half of the year, we expect Oliver Wyman's revenue growth to moderate. In summary, our excellent second quarter and year-to-date results are consistent with our 2014 business plan. And we remain well positioned to deliver on the long-term goals we committed to at Investor Day: growth in revenue, long-term EPS growth of 13%, increasing cash flows and return of capital to shareholders through reducing share count and double-digit dividend growth. With that, let me turn it over to Mike.
J. Michael Bischoff: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, revenue increased 7% to $3.3 billion or 5% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 11% to $656 million, the highest level of second quarter profitability in our history. The consolidated adjusted margin rose from 19.2% to 19.8%. GAAP EPS increased 12% to $0.77, and adjusted EPS increased 10% to $0.79. As we highlighted on last quarter's call, we anticipated that this quarter would be impacted by a meaningful reduction in investment income and, within the Risk and Insurance Services segment, the impact of planned expense growth and the negative effects of foreign exchange. The adverse FX impact was slightly less than the $0.02 we have projected since several major currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar. In the third quarter, we expect foreign exchange to impact Risk and Insurance Services by the same magnitude as this quarter. Investment income. We had an investment loss of $2 million this quarter compared with investment income of $23 million in the prior year, a reduction of $0.03 per share on a year-over-year basis. For modeling purposes, we'd like you to note that any investment income from Trident III that may occur in the last half of this year will most likely be offset by corporate initiatives. As you may recall, income from Trident III only represents our general partner carried interest. And the timing of this we do not control. In the second quarter, MMC issued $600 million of 3.5% 10-year senior notes. This allowed us to fund the July debt maturity of $320 million. By refinancing at attractive interest rates, the average cost of our debt has declined 60 basis points over the past year. Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 27.6% in the second quarter. As you know, the tax rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter, reflecting our geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years and the impact of changes in international and/or state tax rates. For example, in the second quarter, we completed the federal tax audit with the IRS for the 2012 tax year. Since we expect our tax rate to be approximately 30% for the remainder of this year, the effective tax rate for the full year should be around 29.5%. Our 34% interest investment in Alexander Forbes will cost $312 million. This investment will occur in 2 tranches, with approximately 15% completed last week and the remaining 19% subject to normal regulatory approvals, which should occur during the third quarter. Consistent with the guidance we offered at Investor Day, CapEx for this year is trending at about $400 million, with $202 million spent year-to-date. Approximately 2/3 of this spend relates to technology and systems and about 1/3 is for real estate. These investments are enhancing growth, improving efficiency, expanding client and colleague capabilities and reducing real estate cost as we consolidate office locations when leases expire. We follow a balanced capital management philosophy: reinvestment in each of our businesses for growth and return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. Cash was $2 billion at the end of the second quarter, consisting of $1.66 billion held internationally and $340 million in the United States. Cash utilized in the second quarter included $138 million for dividends, $72 million for 3 acquisitions and $250 million to repurchase 5 million shares of our stock. This marks the ninth consecutive quarter of share buybacks. For the first 6 months of this year, we have deployed over $1 billion for dividends, acquisitions and share repurchase. As we communicated at Investor Day, we plan to grow both organically and through quality acquisitions. We will consistently return excess capital to shareholders, both through double-digit growth in dividends and meaningful share repurchase. We're committed to reducing our share count year-after-year. Overall, looking at both our financial and operating performance, a very strong first half of the year. Looking forward, we expect adjusted EPS growth in the second half of the year to exceed the 10% growth we reported in the first 6 months. We are on target to deliver strong EPS growth for the full year. With that, I am happy to turn it back to Dan.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Mike. Jamie, we're ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I was hoping that we could spend more time talking about what you are seeing at Guy Carpenter. I mean, the growth did stand out in the quarter, especially in light of the market commentary that we're hearing in terms of prices down double digits. If you can comment on what you saw price-wise during the recent June and July renewals. And also, your expectations for the balance of the year, if you expect that you can kind of sustain that 2% growth level? Or what we might see in the back half of the year?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. So thank you, Elyse. It's Dan here, and I'll just kick off some commentary on the market in general. I think it's important to know that everyone I have sitting around this table is a seasoned hand in the risk and insurance services space. And from that perspective, we operate over many, many years in all kinds of markets. And usually, the risk and insurance services market, for one reason or another, is usually softer, softening, and so we're quite used to the idea that the market is competitive and that there's downward pressure on rates. And so Guy Carpenter has done a good job anticipating the future, really starting many quarters ago. And so, Alex, do you want to dig in a little deeper?
Alexander S. Moczarski: Sure. Thank you very much. So yes, echoing what Dan has said, we've been -- it's now 5.5 years where we haven't gone backwards in any quarter. So 22 quarters without going backwards, which I think is a testament to the strength of the management and the people that we have within the company and our relationships with our clients. And as we've said in Investor Day, we've continued to look at bringing new products, new services into our portfolio. And we've also executed on segmentation, which we talked about. So we're widening our net. We have many more smaller clients than we had before. We've invested in people. We've actually increased our headcount probably around 140 people over the last year or so. Many of those are what we call strategic hires that relate to bringing in new business. Others are based on bringing in new services around our strategic advisory. Others are related to acquisitions that we've made in what we consider to be growth areas, like Accident and Health and Agriculture. And then finally, we have been able to bring in some very good people to look after the increased client base that we have because we have many more clients. So yes, rates have been coming down. But it's interesting because some companies have found that the contingent capital is very interesting. They're actually changing that strategy around buying reinsurance. Others are using some of their budget now to buy casualty reinsurance. So it's not a tale of woe, it's just -- it's around execution. It's around client relationships. It's around leaning forward. It's around investing. And I think we'll be able to show modest growth, mild growth for the rest of the year.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Alex. So Elyse, just to summarize that, it's -- it won't be a banner top line year for Guy Carpenter, but we do expect to see growth over the entire year.
Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then one other, in terms of RIS just looking at the overall margins, you guys did say about modest margin improvement for the full year. I think you used the word slight in your prepared remarks.
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes.
Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Now has that changed from where you were sitting last quarter? I know you guys pointed to some negative impacts from foreign exchange, as well as the expense growth in the second quarter. But when you're looking at the back half of the year, has your expectations changed? Or is that kind of similar to where we were sitting a few months ago?
Daniel S. Glaser: It's very similar to where we were a few months ago. So nothing's really changed on that front. I mean, let me just address RIS margins in general because our view is we will continue to expand margins over time, while we invest for future growth. The level of margin improvement is going to move around and vary a bit based upon where the top line is and the pace of our investments, which can be lumpy from time to time. This year, in particular, we expect good revenue and good earnings growth in RIS but slight margin expansion for the year.
J. Michael Bischoff: And I would just add on our foreign exchange modeling. Obviously, the currencies can move dramatically across the dollar. But from the beginning of the year, we essentially gave guidance, and then we updated that guidance in the first quarter earnings call. It really did not change. And as I just indicated, our current modeling, despite marked movements in the euro and the pound, still indicates that the second and third quarters will feel the most negative impact for RIS. And in fact, every quarter, RIS, most likely, will feel foreign exchange negative impacts. So our view on the impact of foreign exchange has not changed. I would also point out that the -- just seasonally, the third quarter is the smallest for RIS, so foreign exchange may impact it slightly more in the third quarter vis-à-vis the second. But just to reiterate what Dan said, no, our view has not changed at all.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Dan, if I recall correctly, last quarter and the Investor Day, you have reiterated that you have more of a focus on profit growth in Risk and Insurance Services than margin expansion. I just want to see if that's still the case.
Daniel S. Glaser: That's absolutely right. I mean, when I -- to be frank, I don't spend 5 minutes worrying about our margins or our ability to expand margins in the future. And when I look at our raw absolute margins in RIS, even though they were down 20 bps, they were up 170 bps in the second quarter of 2013, and they're up 20 bps through the 6 months this year. And then when I look at just the absolute amount, 25.4% through 6 months, in my mind, is very competitive in the marketplace. And so it's really about how do we take this terrific business and grow it faster both on the top line and on earnings while maintaining and improving our margins over time.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: All right. That's helpful. And then on Guy Carpenter, unlike one of your major competitors that saw a pullback in organic growth in reinsurance brokerage, Guy Carpenter actually accelerated versus the first quarter. It will be helpful to get some color on that maybe from Alex. Was that account wins? Was that some other factor that helped drive growth to a better level?
Alexander S. Moczarski: Yes, we had very good new business. And that's -- again, that's part of 2 things, really. It's the segmentation strategy, it's focusing to get the right products to the right type of clients and going into areas where we -- perhaps, we had some business, but we didn't realize how strong it was, and so we've created a segment around it, and we've focused people on it. That's been very effective. And our retention has been good as far as clients. We haven't lost -- no, I don't -- I could name maybe one that we've lost in the last quarter. So all in all, good retention, good new business and selling new product.
Daniel S. Glaser: And then I think it's important to reiterate, Jay, what Alex had said earlier as well, that even though this is a slow growth environment for Guy Carpenter, we believe Guy Carpenter is absolutely one of the jewels in our crown. And we are continuing to invest. Guy Carpenter, over the last several years, it's been our fastest grower, they're competitive in the market, they've got a great leadership team, and in many ways, they've become the employer of choice. And so from our basis, we're continuing to grow the top line. The numbers that -- the headcount, the numbers that Alex had referred to earlier in the call when he was talking about more than 100 different hires, that represents 6% or so of Guy Carpenter's headcount. So you can see, in the last 12 months, we've made a bet on Guy Carpenter and the reissuance business in general.
Operator: And we'll take the next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I guess just one question. You mentioned revenue growth outpacing expense growth overall. Can we talk -- drill down maybe a bit into the Risk segment, where it looks like maybe that hasn't been the case here. Recently, I know you mentioned some expense initiatives. We'd love to sort of understand those and just sort of get an idea of what's happening to natural margins, excluding these types of initiatives. And if those are still on pace to deliver the same type of performance that you sort of talked about across the whole book.
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. I mean, in the RIS segment, when I look over the last, really, 5 years or even slightly longer, virtually, in every quarter, revenue growth for RIS exceeds expense growth. That's a discipline of the company. It's a philosophy of the entire firm, and it's how we operate the business. And so it is not that we intend for that to reverse. Sure, there may be the odd quarter here or there where we get upside down. But believe me, we won't stay upside down. Now if I look on the expense side for the whole company, including RIS, we've been operating in a managed expense environment all the way through the financial crisis and its aftermath. And so if you look at the last 8 quarters, our expense growth this quarter at 3%, it's actually the highest expense growth we've had in the last 8 quarters. But certainly, 3% is not a worrying trend to us from that standpoint. And we expect RIS to continue to invest as they see necessary in order to generate future growth.
Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. Okay. And then on the Consulting side, would it be possible to understand what sort of happened to Mercer margins year-over-year and what happened to Oliver Wyman, where -- can we -- should we make the assumption that in each of those subsegments that margins were flat? It's just a larger share of the total pie that Oliver Wyman earned this year?
Daniel S. Glaser: I mean, I would look at a couple of things on this basis. First of all, the margins are far from flat in our Consulting segment. I mean, the overall segment was up 160 basis points in the quarter, and that's on top of 120 basis points in the second quarter of last year. The 16.2% margin in the quarter, the highest quarter that we've had in our recognition but certainly over the last 20 years. So there's been tremendous margin expansion in the Consulting segment not only last year, but we've got growth-on-growth this year. And both -- Oliver Wyman, we don't break out our margins by operating company because it is a Consulting segment, but I can say, Oliver Wyman and Mercer have both contributed to the margin expansion within Consulting.
Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And then just lastly, on the tax rate. It looks like it declined a bit year-over-year. Maybe some thoughts on that. And generally, like how do you think about taxes relative to your peers? And is that something that you want to address or where that you feel like you're comfortable where you are?
Daniel S. Glaser: Well, Mike, do you want to take that?
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes, I'd be more than happy to. And Jay, you're absolutely correct. Tax is a fairly complex topic. With regard to our peers, I won't comment too much on that. Obviously, we have peers that we're competing against that have a tax rate higher than we do, and we have peers that have a tax rate lower than we do. So we really do focus on what we can do and how we can manage it. I would say one thing is different than when we reported it in the second half of last -- in the second quarter of last year. In the second quarter of last year, we had given guidance to the investment community that our tax rate would be about 30% for the entire year. And over the course of the first 6 months, the tax rate was trending slightly lower than that. And we still said that it should be about 30% for the entire year. It's different this year. It's different this year in that we did have some discrete items. I did mention the larger one, which is that we completed the open year of 2012 with regard to our federal return with the IRS. And so our tax rate for the first half of the year was below the 30%. But as you could hear in my prepared remarks, we don't think we'll give any of that back. And so we're hopeful that our tax rate over the last 6 months would be 30%. So our effective tax rate will be 29.5%. That's the -- for the year. And that's the lowest that we've seen in many years, so we're encouraged by that.
Operator: And we'll go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So first question is on buybacks. It looks like you -- today, you said you're going to a capital management plan for this year $2.1 billion, including $800 million acquisitions; $600 million for dividends. About -- that leave about $700 million for buybacks. You did $400 million, so just in the first half. So I just wonder, is that math indicate that in the second half you're going to slow down? And also related to your cash balance in the U.S., $340 million, will that be the limiting factor how much you can -- how quickly you can buy back your shares?
J. Michael Bischoff: Excuse me, this is Mike Bischoff. I just want to get the math correct. We did $350 million of share repurchase in the first 6 months. We did $100 million in the first quarter and $250 million in the second quarter.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I'm sorry. My bad. My math is bad.
J. Michael Bischoff: Sure.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So basically, you're looking for about the same pace then in the second half?
Daniel S. Glaser: Well, yes. I mean, but -- and the thing is what we outlined on Investor Day in terms of that $2.1 billion and sort of the, let's say, the hold we had with regard to our expectations around acquisitions, leaving $1.3 billion or so available for dividends and share repurchase, that's as good a number as any for you to use right now. I mean, it certainly, in our expectation, won't be less than that amount.
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes. Just to add clarity to that so there's no ambiguity. We are fairly clear on Investor Day. We were indicating that return of capital to shareholders would be about $1.3 billion. That would be comprised of dividends and share repurchase. Tracking through the first 6 months, dividends were $275 million, and shares, as I mentioned, were $350 million. You're absolutely right that Dan, in -- at Investor Day, indicated that we had kind of allocated in our own thinking about $800 million for acquisitions over the course of the year. Nice to report that our pipeline has been very robust. Our acquisitions through the first 6 months were $439 million. With the investment that you just heard us describe in Alexander Forbes, that's another $312 million. So we're roughly $750 million already against that $800 million that Dan articulated in Investor Day. So in every category, we're not only tracking but feel very good with regard to what we articulated at Investor Day.
Daniel S. Glaser: And thanks, Kai, because it really is a good question. And like we said at Investor Day, even if we go over our placeholder of $800 million, we don't expect that, that would impact the $1.3 billion that we're thinking about in terms of share repurchase and dividend.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Great. Then secondly, can you give update on the private health exchange and what the pipeline looks like, and especially going into the second half, probably the peak of the enrollment season?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. Julio, do you want to take that?
Julio A. Portalatin: Thanks, Dan, and thanks, Kai for the question. Last time, we updated the numbers at Investor Day. We said around 300,000 lives or so spread across about 80 clients. And we have -- that included both the active and the retiree space. Our sales process continues very aggressively. Our pipeline is very, very strong. The selling season is at its height. And we continue to have clients who are choosing the platform, and they will sign up as of the first of the year 2015 and then throughout the year as well because, as you know, we have a lot of middle-market clients that have different enrollment dates. So it's great to be able to pace that throughout the year. And as we said in the last call, we plan on updating sales activity in lives as we get through the third quarter and early fourth quarter. And it's going to be, I think, a very good outcome for us. The -- I can say the activity has been stronger. We're very, very pleased. We think it's best to give that update towards the end of the year, when the full picture is well known, and the sales season is complete. But I have to tell you, the level of dialogue we're having with our clients and prospects around these changes is very high, and we're just very pleased with how it's going. And stay tuned for the announcements, I guess, later on.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Larry Greenberg with Janney Capital.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Just to nitpick a little bit more on margins, you mentioned FX about the same in 3Q as 2Q. When we think about expense comparisons in the third and fourth quarters, I mean, is there any unevenness to those quarters in comparison with the year ago?
Daniel S. Glaser: No, I think what Mike was alluding to is, particularly in RIS, the third quarter is our smallest revenue quarter. And so expenses, some of which are straight line throughout the year, tend to look a little bit higher. We always have our lowest margins in the third quarter, and that's been the case for many, many years. And so that -- but there's nothing that is anticipated which is changing the trajectory. And as Mike mentioned earlier, we're expecting a better second half of the year from an earnings growth standpoint.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Right. Good. That's helpful. And then can you just elaborate a little bit more on the acquisitions that you've made, including Alexander Forbes? And just what that brings to you guys either strategically or geographically?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. So I'll take that to start with, Larry, and then I'll hand off to Peter in the first instance to talk about some of Marsh & McLennan Agency because that's really been a focus for us over the last number of years in terms of acquisition strategy and philosophy. And then we'll hand over to Julio, who will specifically talk about Alexander Forbes and how thrilled we are to be the anchor investor on their recent IPO. Let me just say, just to begin with and reiterating some of the thoughts that we had on Investor Day, acquisitions have really been a core part of our strategy and philosophy over many years. We developed relationships over a long period of time. And frankly, when we do acquisitions, more times than not, it's both sides thinking, hey, we'll be better together than we are apart, so why don't we get together? I mean, our focus is certainly on the 4 pillars that we always outlined to you, but also talent, quality, cultural fit, economics. And we generally prefer companies that are growing faster than we are or trading below our multiple or where we see the business and we believe we can improve the business and improve its margins. So Peter, do you want to talk a little bit about MMA?
Peter Zaffino: Sure, Dan. Thanks. Well, MMA is a very consistent story, continues to drive organic growth. We've done 39 acquisitions since 2009, and our annualized revenue is closing in at around $650 million. We did 3 acquisitions in the second quarter. Dan mentioned in his opening comments one in North Carolina, the largest independent agency, Senn Dunn, which has a real balanced property and casualty employee benefits portfolio mix. And it's really becoming a core differentiator for us in the United States. If I could add one thing before handing it over to Julio is that the Alexander Forbes insurance acquisition has proven to be incredibly valuable for Marsh, giving us a footprint in sub-Sahara Africa. It's been a strong contributor in connecting our multinational clients, and so that has been a real differentiation for Marsh. And it's contributing to organic growth in the EMEA region.
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, so we've really been quite active in Marsh, not only in MMA but also Africa, Panama, Peru, Dominican Republic. Julio, do you want to talk about Alexander Forbes?
Julio A. Portalatin: Thanks, Dan and Peter. For quite some time now, we've been articulating a strategy to want to become much more significant in the growth market economies around the world, and this is obviously a further step in that direction. Through this investment, we gain great exposure to a great management team, great clients and a fantastic footprint in a geography that's going to be growing certainly over the next decade. And Mercer will have a role on Alexander Forbes Board of Directors. We will contribute strategic expertise in a global perspective. We'll be supportive to African clients who want to become global outside of Africa, as well as our clients will have the benefit of a great structure inside of South Africa and sub-Sahara Africa when they're expanding into Africa. We believe that the transaction offers just some real significant value to both the client base of both sides of the transaction and also the employees and opportunities for the future. We're really pleased with this transaction. I couldn't be more excited about it, and we're looking forward to maximizing it's value as time goes on.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thanks, Julio. Does that cover it, Larry?
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Yes, it's helpful.
Operator: And we'll go next to Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Just a question on your international cash. Does your 30% tax rate for the balance of the year include any plans for movement of international cash over to the U.S. holding company?
Daniel S. Glaser: Mike?
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes, very good question. I think we generally indicated that we have about $1.4 billion of international cash going into the year dedicated on a permanently invested basis. And you can see with regard to Alexander Forbes, that's one way that we plan to utilize international cash. With regard to the U.S., yes, we do have repatriation strategies. We look at it over multiple years. As you know, the main driver of need for cash in the U.S. is for share repurchase and dividends, in addition to funding the acquisitions in the U.S., predominantly MMA. And then specifically to your question, which is does the 30% tax rate guidance for the last 6 months and 29.5% for the entire year include the repatriation of funds that we need from our international operations into the U.S. for these purposes that I just mentioned? And the answer is yes, it does.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then also just a question on some of the investments that you're making in the business. Your capital expenditure has been running higher than a lot of your peers, and I was wondering if you could just maybe expand a little bit on some of the things that you're doing. And are these investments targeted towards more operational efficiency, growth efforts? Maybe just some color around them would be helpful.
Daniel S. Glaser: Well, if you say operational efficiencies, growth and reducing risk, you would have had the trifecta. So well done, Dan. The main drivers are those 3 areas, so initiatives to improve growth, to drive efficiency and reduce risk. Mike, do you want to add some color to that?
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes, I -- once again, I won't mention our rate of CapEx compared to competitors because they may have their own needs. But with regard to us, our CapEx spending did increase fairly significantly from the levels of '09, 2010 and building up to where it was in 2013 and 2014, tracking at about $400 million. And like I've said, about 2/3 of that is in technology for, really, IT upgrades. There's finance transformation. We have new fiduciary revenue and billing systems not only in the U.S. but introducing that in the U.K. We have data centers and client analytics. And so we really have been spending over the last several years to make MMC even stronger and more efficient with expanded client and colleague capabilities. The other roughly 30% is, as I mentioned, reducing our global real estate footprint, more efficiency, collocations, cost savings and also putting in the smart office concepts for our colleagues.
Operator: And we'll go next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Given the growth at Oliver Wyman, has the business become seasonal in terms of revenues? And does that have any impact on exacerbating seasonality in Consulting margins?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, no, it's an interesting question. I would approach it in a couple of different ways, and then I'll hand off to Scott to give a little bit more flavor to it. First, if you look at our overall business between Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting, it's reasonably well balanced. And so from that standpoint, you don't see large seasonal shifts as we go throughout the year on the Consulting side. And as we mentioned earlier, on the RIS side, you tend to see a seasonal dip in revenue in the third quarter, and the other 3 quarters for RIS are reasonably similar to each other. You also have to bear in mind that when we look at the RIS segment, Guy Carpenter is much smaller than Marsh. And when you look at the Consulting segment, Oliver Wyman is much smaller than Mercer. And so even though Oliver Wyman may be growing much faster for a period of time, its impact on the overall numbers for -- particularly on earnings for the Consulting segment is muted just because of its size relative to Mercer. But Scott, do you want to talk about potential seasonality?
Scott McDonald: Sure. I don't think, Josh, that the seasonality has changed. In management consulting, typically, we see slower months in July and August and then in December and January as there's lower client activity in that. That's been that way for many years and hasn't changed. Specifically, the growth we're seeing now, I think, is driven by -- not by seasonality but by 3 things. The first is we had a pretty weak 2013, and so our comparison to that is excellent. It will get harder through the second half of the year as our second half of the year was better last year. The economic environment has been supportive of corporate confidence, and they've been spending money on Consulting. So that has been helpful for us. And we've made a lot of changes at Oliver Wyman over the last 18 months or 2 years around the organization and approach to market. I think we've made it a better firm, and we're being more successful in the market and that should continue. So I'd expect we'll still see strong continued growth. The seasonality won't be different than the past, but the current growth rates in the high teens are unsustainable, we think.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And so when you say moderating growth -- I mean, I know you don't give specific guidance, but maybe I'm looking for a little bit. Does moderate mean high single digits? Or does that mean in line with the rest of Consulting?
Daniel S. Glaser: I would say -- and it's Dan here, speaking for Scott. I would say moderating growth means to the mid- to high single digits at least in my business plan and, hopefully, in Scott's.
Operator: And we'll go next to Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Going back to Guy Carpenter, is there any dislocation in the reinsurance brokerage arena where maybe more clients than you would've expected are open to the idea of switching brokers?
Daniel S. Glaser: I'll take that to start with, and then hand over to Alex. I mean, the client retention levels in reinsurance broking in general, and certainly Guy Carpenter specifically, are extremely high and would be the envy of all of our other Opcos. I mean, the -- so the switching that you might see more often on the retail side in either consumer businesses, retail businesses is not prevalent on the reinsurance side. So this is -- so when companies switch, it's usually a multi-year relationship development. And Guy Carpenter is showing its innovative skills in creating a relationship of trust and then a movement happens. It's not a price-spaced or a point-in-time type of shift. But Alex, do you have something else to add to that?
Alexander S. Moczarski: I would say I'd echo again what you said. I'd maybe say that there's been changes in the brokerage structure within the marketplace, okay, and that's brought some changes. The other thing -- the other reason why we might get a -- lose a piece of business -- but actually, we haven't been losing -- but when a piece of business is because there's a change in management in one of the insurance companies or change in ownership. And there's been some of that going on. So -- but I don't see any major change or shift in the landscape that you might be questioning.
Daniel S. Glaser: So we have seen no secular dislocation, Meyer. Any other questions?
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Yes, just one quick one. Once you've acquired the 34% stake in Alexander Forbes, where does that impact the income statement? Is that investment income?
Daniel S. Glaser: Mike, do you want to take that?
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes. No, actually, it will be the equity method of accounting. So it will be the earnings of Alexander Forbes. And then our proportional share, which will be 34% when we complete the tranche in this quarter. And then it will be tax affected. And then it will be added to the revenue each quarter for Mercer.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Vinay Misquith with Evercore.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: The first question is on the Risk and Insurance segment. I believe you said margin expansion will be modest this year, and this was, in large part, due to the foreign exchange. Just curious, on a more normalized basis, how much of margin expansion do you expect in that segment?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes. I mean, I'm not setting a margin target for the RIS segment over time. I would say that we expect our revenues in RIS to generally be exceeding our expenses in RIS as we march forward. I would also say that the margin levels in RIS are very competitive in the market, and they may actually be market leading at this stage. So our view is to focus our attention, as we mentioned at Investor Day, in growing top line revenue and also growing our earnings in this high-margin business as opposed to overly focusing on margins. Margins will -- margin expansion will be an outcome rather than a driver of our activity. Any other question?
Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Yes. Just in the Consulting segment, you've shown very strong margins first half of this year. Should we see a small slowdown in the pace of margin improvement in the second half?
Daniel S. Glaser: I mean, the Consulting margins have been rocketing forward over the last 2.5 years. And really, that's down to the leadership team and everyone getting behind the idea of running the business more like an overall advisory and transactional firm and less like a pure consulting firm. And so they -- we've made tremendous strides in running the business from that standpoint. We -- when we look forward over not only the back half of the year but in the future, we believe both of our segments have the ability to grow their margins. And so that is a focus of the company a little bit more so these days in Consulting than in RIS. But overall, I would say, for both segments, the primary interest of ours is growing organic revenue, followed by growing earnings and margin expansion as an outcome of us growing our revenue at a faster pace than growing our expenses.
Operator: And we'll go next to Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.
Charles Sebaski: Was curious about growth at Marsh, and I wonder if we could get any color on contribution to organic growth from Marsh Agency. I know the comment about $650 million in revenue, but as that sort of earns in and becomes organic over time, can we get some thought on how that's helping versus the traditional Marsh business?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. Sure. Well, I'll just start by saying if you look at the RIS segment in total, we've had 17 consecutive quarters of 3% organic growth or better. So we're quite pleased with our growth in this tough market environment of our RIS segment. And Marsh, specifically, has had 4% growth 3 quarters in a row. So Peter and his team are doing a phenomenal job in developing organic growth in a very big company. And so Peter, do you want to give us more color?
Peter Zaffino: Sure. If I -- thanks, Dan. If I start with MMA, we look at some of the peer companies outside of the organization for middle market business, and they are performing at or above what we expect on organic growth. I mean, the U.S. and Canada division has multiple businesses in it, and therefore, it is a big contributor. But we also have the core U.S. business for brokerage. We have Canada. We have an MGA, a private client. We have a program business. We have a technology business in STARS. And they all contributed, perhaps, not all in the same quarter, but MMA has been a really steady contributor. We have been investing for organic growth as we outlined at Investor Day. And as we continue to expand our footprint, we feel we have more balance for that growth.
Charles Sebaski: Okay. I guess on another segment, saw some commentary that there's been a change in U.K. pensions, and curious if this is a U.K.-specific or company-wide and what the potential effect on expenses are on making a pension change away from a defined benefit.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. So a couple of things. One, the U.K. plans both have assets and liabilities above GBP 4 billion, which makes them the largest within MMC. Our goal in the U.K. -- and you're right that we recently made a change. Actually, it's effective, I believe, August 1. But we recently decided upon a change, in consultation with our colleagues in the U.K., to move from a defined benefit plan to close it and freeze it and move to a DC plan. And our goal in the U.K. was not to achieve cost savings. So let me just tell you that right off the bat. Our objective was to create a DC plan, which is highly competitive in the market, consistent and fair to all colleagues and which reduce risk over time for MMC. And we believe we've achieved that. Now in terms of other plans, we periodically review our plans to assess market competitiveness, consistency across MMC, risk, costs, all of those things. But right now, we have no current plans to amend any of our other DB plans at this point in time.
Charles Sebaski: And there isn't -- in terms of when you say reducing the risk, and I'm assuming the volatility, but that doesn't -- I mean, that doesn't equate into a cost save? I mean, I realize that the plan of it is to limit volatility, but that volatility would seem that it would be a volatility up, right, that's in the long term, maybe not next couple -- next quarter or 2, but the next couple of years should be some inherent cost savings, no?
Daniel S. Glaser: The -- any savings on large DB plans are driven more by interest rate movements and discount rate movements, a little bit of asset returns, that sort of thing as opposed to whether you're a DB or DC. The cost to the company for providing the benefit is actually quite similar. And we did have benefits in terms of mitigating -- essentially closing the DB plan and freezing it. We did receive a curtailment gain, which we cycled back largely to the colleague base in the U.K. in terms of mitigating the impact on some of our colleagues. So there's really no material financial impact based upon that change.
Operator: And we'll go next to Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes. Just a couple of quick ones here. The first one, Mike, just a clarification on your comment with respect to the Trident III. Did you say that it's going to be offset, largely, any income by additional corporate initiatives?
J. Michael Bischoff: That's correct.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So we should expect just kind of breakeven for the investment gains for the remainder of the year?
J. Michael Bischoff: I think for modeling purposes, Brian, that makes a lot of sense.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then one other quick one for you, Mike. I noticed you guys raised $600 million, paying down $320 million, so you're going to have a little more debt on the balance sheet. Is there any kind of conscious initiative to maybe increase leverage here a little bit going forward?
Daniel S. Glaser: I think in general -- and I'll start off and then hand to Mike to add a little bit more color. I think our objective over time, and we talked a little bit about this at Investor Day, is to, over time, reduce cash on the balance sheet to the extent that's practical. Over time, to raise our level of debt as well still as a conservatively run company. But overall, our ability to handle more debt is certainly prevalent and interest rates are pretty low. We have a balanced approach. And so I think you're going to see both of those factors as we move forward over the next several quarters and a couple of years. But Mike, do you want to add to that?
J. Michael Bischoff: No, Dan. I think that's well said. It's a balance. We're improving and have improved our credit metrics, but we can continue to improve our credit metrics even with this steadily -- well, not steadily but beginning to expand the overall debt on our balance sheet. And that's, obviously, only one issue of leverage. It has to do with the pension obligations, present value of our operating leases, and we've worked very diligently on those areas as well. So as Dan said, it's a balance.
Operator: So that final question comes from Cliff Gallant with Nomura.
Clifford H. Gallant - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: I just want -- I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about some of the comments you made earlier about the underwriting environment and the cycle, particularly on the insurance side. I believe a few quarters ago, there was a comment made on your call that reinsurance pricing weakness was -- historically, has always led to a weakness on the primary side, and I'm curious as to what degree do you think things are different this time? Are things meeting your expectations? Has been there more or less disciplined among the insurance companies?
Daniel S. Glaser: It's Dan here. We don't think things will be different this time. We think, fundamentally, that as reinsurance prices reduce, it gives more flexibility for primary carriers to adjust their strategies and figure out other ways to grow their business. And some of that may be giving up some of the gains that they've obtained on their own reinsurance programs. But Peter, do you want to talk about what's happening in the retail?
Peter Zaffino: Sure. I think when we talk about reinsurance, it's been primarily driven by property cat and property declines. When we look at our overall portfolio, we're in so many different countries across the world, that they all tend to have different dynamics based on mix of business, based on geographical footprint. But if I was to comment and see what's happening on pricing on the primary side, we have seen more reductions; nothing dramatic, but a modest reduction continuing in the second quarter. If I look at some of the regions, Latin America probably had pricing falling off the most but it's still low to mid-single digits. Line of business was really driven by property. Having said that, we're cautiously optimistic that we're seeing more exposure increase on the overall book of business. And so looking at total insured values, payroll in the U.S., sales across the world has been a modest offset to some of the modest price declines.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thanks, Peter. And I think that about does it for the call. So I'd like to thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. I'd also like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. Have a good day.

Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. First quarter 2014 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They’re available on the company’s website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risk and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company’s most recent SEC filings, which are available on the MMC website, for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I’ll now turn the call over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Dan Glaser: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I’m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO. I’d also like to welcome our operating companies’ CEOs – Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter, Julio Portalatin of Mercer and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman Group. Also with us this morning is Keith Walsh, Head of Investor Relations. I am pleased with our first quarter results. We’ve had a strong start to the year and are continuing the earnings momentum we’ve achieved over the past several years. In the quarter, we produced several underlying revenue growth, substantial margin improvement and double digit growth in earnings while returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. This performance was very much in line with the themes we laid out in March at our Investor Day which I would like to spend a few moments reinforcing. First, MMC is a unique company with several competitive advantages, including the quality of our colleagues, deep client relationships, a vast global footprint, depth of intellectual capital and capabilities and a cohesive, collaborative culture. We are strong strategically, operationally and financially. And we are getting stronger. Our strategy is to focus on growing revenue, earnings, margins and cash flow with low capital requirements and to manage risk intelligently. We are committed to long term EPS growth of 13%, increasing cash flows, reducing our share count each year and delivering double digit dividend increases. With this level of growth, combined with lower polls on our cash for pension and restructuring, we anticipate generating substantially higher levels of cash flow with dividends, share repurchase and acquisitions. In 2013, we allocated $1.2 billion to these three items. In 2014, we expect capital available for dividends, share repurchase and acquisitions to grow 75% to $2.1 billion. Now, let me give you a little more color on our first quarter results. MMC’s underlying revenue growth was 4%. This exceeded the increase in underlying operating expenses as it has for all but one quarter over the past six years. Our consolidated adjusted margin rose 120 basis points to 20.9%, our highest quarterly margin since 2004. Even as we produce exceptional financial results, we continue to make ongoing investments. Our level of capital expenditures reflects this approach and is part of our balanced capital allocation strategy to drive sustainable growth to revenue, earnings and cash flow. Looking at our Risk and Insurance Services segment, revenue was $1.8 billion with underlying revenue growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income increased 6% to $500 million and the margin rose 60 basis points to 27.2%, the highest in a decade. This margin expansion is notable when you consider that it is on top of a 210 basis point expansion in the first quarter of last year. At Marsh, revenue was $1.5 billion, an underlying revenue increase of 4%. This growth reflects solid renewals with strong client retention in all major areas and strong new business growth in Asia Pacific and in the Middle East. All major geographic regions contributed to the solid revenue performance in the quarter. In the US-Canada division, underlying growth was 2%. The international division expanded 4% as underlying revenue growth continued throughout Marsh’s vast footprint. Latin America with growth of 11% reported its sixth consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Asia Pacific also continued to generate strong growth, rising 9%. Guy Carpenter’s revenue was flat on an underlying basis, in line with our expectations. Revenue growth in international operations, marine and facultative was offset by higher levels of capacity, increased retentions by clients and significant rate reductions in many lines [ph]. In the consulting segment, revenue was $1.4 billion, up 5% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income was $225 million, an increase of 19% from the prior year. And the segment’s margin increased 190 basis points to 15.8%, the highest first quarter margin in at least 20 years. Mercer’s revenue was $1.1 billion, an underlying increase of 3%. The revenue increase was spread across all geographic regions with particular strength from growth markets. Growth was driven by investments, which increased 8%. Retirement growth of 4% reflects strong levels of benefit administration work unique to this quarter. Oliver Wyman’s revenue in the first quarter was $371 million, reflecting strong underlying growth of 11%. The results reflect significant growth in the financial services business and strong growth in Europe and North America. In summary, we are well positioned to deliver on the long term goals we discussed at Investor Day which should lead to superior returns for our shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Mike.
Michael Bischoff: Well, thank you, Dan, and good morning everyone. MMC had a strong first quarter. Revenue was $3.3 billion, an increase of 4% on both GAAP and in underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 11% to $682 million, the highest level of quarterly profitability in a decade. The consolidated adjusted margin rose 120 basis points to 20.9% and adjusted EPS increased 11% to $0.81 from $0.73 last year. Investment income was $13 million in the first quarter compared with $21 million in the prior year. We anticipate minimal investment income in the second quarter. Foreign exchange was a slight negative in the quarter, impacting both segments. Corporate expense decreased to $43 million on adjusted basis. Our quarterly run rate should average about $45 million. With our strong first quarter results, we remain on target to deliver excellent EPS growth in 2014. We would like to share with you some insight into MMC’s quarterly earnings growth this year. For example, consistent with our view expressed during the last earnings call, we expect foreign exchange to be a drag throughout the remainder of the year with the greatest impact approximately $0.02 in the second quarter occurring within the RIS segment. In the second quarter, we expect investment income to be approximately $0.03 lower on a year-over-year basis. And in keeping with our 2014 business plan, we expect higher expense growth in the second quarter for the RIS segment. Looking forward, our business plan and current outlook calls for stronger earnings growth in the second half of the year, well beyond what we reported this quarter. Thus, we expect our performance for the entire year to be consistent with what we indicated at Investor Day in March. So we are pleased with our first quarter results and are confident of a successful operating and financial performance this year. Debt. Even with a higher level of debt, interest expense in the first quarter decreased to $42 million from $44 million of the first quarter of last year. By refinancing at attractive interest rates, the average cost of our debt has declined 50 basis points to 5.1%. As we approach the July debt maturity of $320 million, we will crystallize our thinking as it relates to the amount, timing and maturity of the refinancing. We also increased MMC’s financial flexibility on the quarter by amending our revolving credit facility which increased the size from $1 billion to $1.2 billion, extended the maturity from 2016 to 2019 and reduced both the drawn and undrawn pricing. Finally, we are pleased that earlier this week, Moody’s upgraded MMC’s senior debt, reflecting our strong financial position. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.38 billion of cash with approximately $260 million in the United States. Cash utilized in the first quarter included outlays for our annual variable compensation programs, $360 million for acquisitions, $138 million for dividends and $100 million to repurchase $2 million shares of our stock. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter of share buybacks. Finally, to reiterate what we stated at Investor Day, we plan to grow both organically and quality acquisitions. We will consistently return excess capital to shareholders, both through meaningful share repurchases and double digit growth in dividends and we are committed to reducing our share count year after year. With that, I am happy to turn it back to Dan.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Mike. Operator, we’re ready to begin the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, sir. (Operator instructions) And we’ll take our first question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Could you talk a bit about kind of what happened more specifically at Oliver Wyman and whether or not that was an exaggerated curve of growth or if some of the items that you talked about in your prepared comments should lead to sort of outsize growth relative to every other quarter since this one for the remainder of the year?
Dan Glaser: Okay, a couple of things and then I’ll hand over to Scott. I mean, first I think you’re seeing some of the impact of an improving economy and improved business confidence. But also, the year-over-year comparison is a fairly easy one for OW. I’m giving a wink to Scott right now, but it’s a fairly easy one for OW because it was a short quarter in the first quarter of last year. But Scott, you want to give us some more flavor?
Scott McDonald: Sure. Mike, we had a good first quarter and it was driven by pretty broad base strength in the business, a big performance from our financial services business which is our largest business, but also strength across most the other business, including our – the Lippincott, the branding firm, our manufacturing, transportation, energy retail services businesses. And that’s picking up on the continued modest strength in the US economy. I think there’s been surprising strength in the European economy, a little more than we would have expected six months ago. Still modest but surprisingly stronger. International remains mixed, driven by different things around the world. But overall, the business feels strong. The only caveat I’d make is the one that Dan made. We’ve had four quarters of improving performance and that means our comps were pretty easy this quarter. But I expect continued strong growth through the rest of the year but the comps will get harder.
Michael Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs: Right. Yes, I mean, this was usually even higher than ‘08 one Q, so I think it was the highest first quarter you guys have experienced at Oliver Wyman so – I mean I get obviously you got to be down drafting one Q last year but even on a run rate basis, I mean it seems like this is a pretty good top line quarter there. Okay. So I guess the next question; in reinsurance, did you have any negative impact from softer reinsurance pricing and can you talk about any capital markets activity that you saw there?
Dan Glaser: We’ve certainly seen some impact – negative impact from reinsurance pricing. Alex, do you want to go deeper?
Alex Moczarski: Yes, sure. So we talked about the headwinds we would face at Investor Day. The good news is actually our new business was very, very strong in most regions and very health in the US due to our segmentation execution where we should also discuss at Investor Day. This filled the void left by reduced demands for our transactional products that we’ve successfully marketed in the first quarters of the last two years. So we’re replacing one-time transactions with recurring business for new clients. And that’s also reduced the dependency on the large clients that are – that tend to have stronger balance sheets now and are probably buying, in some cases, less reinsurance. And it’s fair enough [ph] in other cases, more reinsurance because the cost of capital is interesting. As regards to capital market transactions, we actually just closed a good one yesterday which I’m happy about. But it’s a lumpy business and so the first quarter didn’t see much of that [ph].
Michael Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs: Got it. So is that capital market activity able to offset some of the margin pressure that you might see from a lower reinsurance pricing?
Alex Moczarski: We’ll take it off.
Dan Glaser: I think what you’re seeing would be multiple things. You’ve got higher levels of capacity, you have insurance companies, some of the large ones retaining more risk. You have increasing alternative capacity and that creates a bit of a competitive activity on how some of the traditional reinsurers are trying to maintain their book in the face of income and capacity. But there’s an awful lot of factors that are at play. And so our feeling about Guy Carpenter was, as we said last quarter, we anticipated a pretty tough year. Guy Carpenter has been our fastest grower over the last several years really in that 5% to 6% organic range. And this year, we’re expecting to see some growth. But it’s modest growth and so it’s not a year that we would drive for margin expansion within Guy Carpenter. It’s one of our finest businesses, it’s a true jewel and this is a year that we’re going to focus on serving clients and getting new ones. I would just make the comment because sometimes brokers miss stating that lower pricing and broader terms and conditions are good for our clients. And we are in the client business, and so from fundamentally, many of our clients will look to obtain other products that they may not have had before because of the lower pricing and broader terms and conditions. So next question, please.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Larry Greenberg with Janney Capital.
Larry Greenberg – Janney Capital Markets: Good morning. It’s a hard exercise from our position but it looked to me like the contribution to revenues in RIS from acquisitions was a little bit lower than I would have expected. I mean is there anything you could comment on there or perhaps any visibility you could give us going forward based on the number of deals that you’ve already done?
Dan Glaser: Yes, there’s a couple of things and then I’ll hand over to Mike who will summarize sort of our acquisition strategy. But I think what you’re seeing is some element of our string of pearls strategy. Marsh’s base and RIS’s base is quite significant. It’s a $6.5 billion segment and so you have to do a lot of pearls in order to see some real shift in movement on the top line. Mike, you want to add to that?
Michael Bischoff: Yes, Dan, you’re absolutely correct. I think what we saw in 2012 was a lot of increased activity in MMA because of the changes in the tax law. And so as we look at the acquisition impact in the Risk and Insurance Services area over the course of 2013, you felt that. Conversely, because so much was done at the end of 2012, it was fairly limited over the course of 2013. What we did and what I indicated in the first quarter of this year is that we had six acquisitions, the largest of which is Barney & Barney which is part of our MMA long term strategic plan. Barney & Barney essentially closed for us in mid quarter, so you wouldn’t feel the full impact of that. So when you put all of that together, Larry, with what Dan says, just the size of insurance services operations, that’s why you end up with the impact that you have in the quarter.
Dan Glaser: Peter, do you have something to add?
Peter Zaffino: Yes, Dan, I think in addition to Mike saying that Barney & Barney closed mid first quarter, the first quarter in terms of revenue is they’re small. And so you’ll start to see more even distribution in the second, third and fourth.
Dan Glaser: Okay, perfect. Any other questions, Larry?
Larry Greenberg – Janney Capital Markets: I’m okay with that. No, I guess just in general, Dan, we’re seeing a little bit of shift in the firm in this – on the primary side of commercial lines. Are you seeing anything surprising or unusual at this point?
Dan Glaser: I’ll address it a little bit and then if Peter has anything to add, but I think first of all, in my 30-year career, most markets will have downward pressure and upward pressure on terms and conditions. I mean that is sort of the pain of the insurance marketplace. And so we have these little periodic short periods of firmness which give away very quickly. And so we’ve built our business really to operate in a shoulder environment and generally a softer environment. I mean there’s a lot of insurance and companies out there competing for business. So having said that, I’d also look at differences between the United States and international. Internationally, it’s been relatively soft forever. And so we’re still seeing softness. That hasn’t changed. And even in areas where there’s catastrophe exposure. There was a firmness in pricing over the last couple of years and that’s beginning to come off. And so we’re seeing that internationally. In the US, the US is probably the best market from a ratings point – from an insurance company’s perspective. But still, it’s not quite as – it doesn’t – the upward trajectory doesn’t feel that it’s stable. So Peter, do you have something to bring in?
Peter Zaffino: I agree, Dan. What we have seen is modest decreases if you look at quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year. They’ve been low single digits driven more by property, as Dan said, where they – peak exposures or companies are deploying cap. They did enjoy some rate increases over the last couple of years and so those are coming off. But where we are seeing that offset a little bit is that Scott mentioned the economies are starting to recover. So – and the US is an example in the low single digits, we started to see total insured values increase, payroll modestly increase as well as sales. So we’re seeing that offset the slight decreases in pricing.
Dan Glaser: Okay. Thanks, Larry. Next question, operator.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Sean Dargan with Macquarie.
Sean Dargan – Macquarie Capital: Yes, thanks. Could you maybe help us frame what the impact of FX headwinds was in the quarter?
Dan Glaser: Sure. Mike?
Michael Bischoff: Yes. When we were looking at it going into the year, we were modeling it out where foreign exchange would have been at the end of January and how that would feel for the entire year. And as we indicated, it was in the neighborhood of $0.04 to $0.05 with a fairly minimal impact in the first quarter. Most of the impact in the second quarter in RIS segment and then the rest of it probably equally split between the third and fourth quarter. That certainly was between $0.00 and $0.01 in the first quarter.
Sean Dargan – Macquarie Capital: Okay, thank you. And I guess another numbers question. The intangible amortization expense increase was fairly modest but thinking about the acquisitions that you just mentioned a few minutes ago, will that be moving higher in a meaningful way this year?
Dan Glaser: Mike?
Michael Bischoff: No. It’s something that we’ve seen over the course of the last four years building up gradually bit by bit. And as we continue to pace, which has been a fairly consistent pace, notwithstanding what I just said in the answer to the prior question, and so some of the prior intangible amortization from earlier acquisitions start to roll off as we add in new. So we would expect it to go up but only go up modestly.
Sean Dargan – Macquarie Capital: All right, thank you.
Dan Glaser: Okay.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.
Kai Pan – Morgan Stanley Smith Barney: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I have the same question on the margin side. First on the RIS segments, the margins have improved quite a bit the last few years. And you mentioned that the increased spending level like in the second half of this year. So does that imply the pace of the margin improvement was slowing down from the last two years?
Dan Glaser: Okay. So a couple of things. You’re correct in noting that the company overall in RIS in particular have had a terrific run of margins over the last several years. When you think about the overall company with a margin of 20.9% and RIS at 27.2% and consulting at 15.8%, both for RIS and consulting, these are the highest margins in 10 years and 20 years or more respectively. So we have been able to drive margins. As I’ve mentioned, in the past, our focus as a leadership team is first growing revenue and earnings. And margin expansion is an outcome of our philosophy in almost all quarters growing revenues at a pace which is greater than growing expenses, and so saying all that. Now in terms of the second quarter, we really didn’t say anything about the second half of the year or the next couple of quarters. We basically said in the second quarter there would be a blip in RIS expenses and it’s for the reasons that Mike mentioned. I mean there’s a blip in RIS expansions, expenses. There’s a bit of a headwind in terms of foreign exchange within RIS as well. And when you look at it overall, we’re still very comfortable that we have the ability over time to grow margins in both segments. Our overall feelings about RIS is that they’ve had a few years head start on our consulting segment. And so from that standpoint, we think that the pace of margin expansion in RIS in the mid and – or in the year and mid-term will be slower than the pace that we see in consulting. But having said that, in the long term, both segments have significant expansion opportunities. Mike, you have anything to add?
Michael Bischoff: Yes. Let me just kind of go back and restate some recent history and put it into context. As far back as ‘07, I think the margins in Risk and Insurance Services were below 9%. I think they were around 8.6%, 8.9%. And as you saw a tremendous improvement in the senior management leadership, you saw those margins improve up through 2010 to 19.3%. And then in 2011, they improved but only to 19.4% So the question was asked then, is all the margin improvement behind us, is that it, do you have to essentially grind it out? And I think Brian Duperreault and Dan said at the time, no, we have a lot of room for further expansion. And you obviously saw that margin go from 19.4% to 20.6% to 22.1%. And just to reiterate and be very clear of what we’re saying, we’re looking for margin improvement in for Risk and Insurance Services this year and beyond but we just wanted to share with you the sequencing of the quarters because it’s been built into our business plan and we wanted to be very clear that you would see probably more growth, in fact, EPS significantly more growth in the second half of the year but wanted to make you aware of the nuances of the second quarter.
Kai Pan – Morgan Stanley Smith Barney: They were thorough answers. And then on the buybacks, $100 million buyback in the first quarter seems a bit low consider the run rate for the full year guidance of $700 million-ish. So is there any particular reason because the cash flow in the first quarter or the stock price getting softer?
Dan Glaser: Okay, thanks for the question. Mike?
Michael Bischoff: Yes. And very insightful question because it does have to do with the seasonality of our cash flows. And our cash rebuilds up through the second half of the year and peaks at the end of the year and then in anticipation of the variable compensation programs and payouts that occur at the end of February and early March. So you can see that our cash position went down fairly dramatically from where it had been at the end of the year through the end of the first quarter. But that notwithstanding, we’re very committed to share repurchased and in the first quarter of last year, we did $100 million and we felt that it was appropriate to do $100 million in the first quarter this year even when it was the heaviest quarter of cash utilization. Now with all of that said, and you’re absolutely right, we will expect to pick up the pace of that for the remainder of the year.
Kai Pan – Morgan Stanley Smith Barney: Thank you so much.
Dan Glaser: All right. Next question, operator.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Hi, good morning. I was hoping to spend a little bit more time talking about just what you’re seeing in with the economic conditions globally. I know you did mention some improvement in the US when you were talking about that earlier just as we kind of frame just organic growth expectations within Marsh both in the US and internationally for the balance of the year.
Dan Glaser: Okay. So I’ll start and then I’ll hand it over to Scott. I mean, one of our enduring advantages is our global footprint. So basically, where there’s growth anywhere in the world, we are on the ground and we will get it. And so when we look at the – and the world is always a choppy place, right? So you’re going to have areas of significant growth and an area of challenge or modest growth in different parts of the world. When we’re looking at the – it’s kind of interesting when we were all at Davos this year because the US sort of over the last four years has gone from the gold to the era [ph]. And so the US level of growth not only in the US but also expansion opportunities around the world is at a better pace than what we’ve seen in the last few years. Although, to be sure, it’s not buoyant out there but it feels a lot better than it did three or four years ago. But Scott?
Scott McDonald: Thanks, Dan. I don’t have too much to add to my comments before but let me go a little deeper. I mean, we’re seeing across the US modest improvements in the economy and at no greater pace than we saw in the first quarter things to improve and we see this in the Oliver Wyman business. I see – I think we see this in the rest of the MMC businesses, too, to an certain extent. Business confidence is improving again at a modest pace and the businesses we’re involved with seem to be spending more on both continued restructuring and on growth initiatives. As I said before, Europe has been a bit of a surprise. I mean, Europe was at a pretty low point. They’re coming off faster than people expected. The economies are recovering a little faster, very good performance in the UK and the politics are a little more stable than ever when expected. All of this is of course in the context of Ukraine and the continued pretty volatile geopolitical environment. So there are things that could throw us off track but we feel pretty comfortable with the US and Europe. And outside those markets, though, we are seeing a lot of volatility. And in most of the growth markets in Latin America or in Asia – I won’t talk about Russia now but – and beyond that, they’re more choppy but there’s more volatility. But we are seeing a reasonably good trend. So we’ve remained mildly optimistic and I don’t have too much more to add than that.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Scott. Elyse, anything –
Elyse Greenspan – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay.
Dan Glaser: – any other question?
Elyse Greenspan – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Yes. I was hoping you could also just provide us a little bit of an update of what you’re seeing with Mercer Marketplace. I guess, when we sit here, it’s a little bit ahead of next year’s enrolment season but just kind of a little bit more of a feedback from last year and just some of your expectations as we look forward and you’re speaking to clients, better thinking about coming on the exchange for 2015.
Dan Glaser: Okay. Perfect. Julio?
Julio Portalatin: Thank you. Elyse, so the question on the Mercer Marketplace; last time, we updated numbers on Investor Day. We had mentioned that there was about 300 lives or so that we had already included in our active and retiree space for Mercer Marketplace. Our sales profits, as you can imagine, is very robust; pipeline continues to grow. It’s good and we continue to have clients going live on the platform throughout the year, especially our middle market clients. Given that we are heavily into the sale cycle for this year, we think it’s best to probably update towards the beginning or at the end of our market sale cycles which is at the end of this year and the beginning of 2015. But you can be assured that the level of dialog and clients – with clients and our prospects and our exchanges is very high. And I look forward to updating you as the year goes on and towards the beginning of next year. Well, you did mention that you also would like to get some color around some of the things – early information that we’ve been able to also get from the enrolment data that we already established this year. I mean, I want to really reiterate that on Investor Day, we talked a little bit about starting to get information out but we’ll be still on early enrolment process. And on balance, we see employees making different choices and buying less life insurance. Many of them were over insured and they’re kind of life sizing the actual plans to their needs. And the result of these choices is an average annual medical cost reduction of about $800 per employee that we’re seeing with the employers seeing about $550 of that savings and employees seeing $250. So as a reminder, Mercer Marketplace enables employees to gain control over their medical insurance course while at the same time offering real value to their employees. And by giving them more choice and control over how they spend healthcare [indiscernible]. So we’ll continue to strive to make sure that there is a differentiated difference for both employees and employers.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Julio. Okay, operator, next question.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Hi. I have two questions here. The first one in the consulting side. The slowdown in the health and benefits growth rate, is that something we should expect to continue here going forward or is there something unusual in the first quarter?
Dan Glaser: Okay. So Julio, you want to take that?
Julio Portalatin: Thank you. A lot of things contributed to softer results but let me just first say that our foreign breadth of business offers that we have for our clients globally gave us an ability to be able to maximize the diversification of numbers in our book [ph]. And in this particular case, a little bit of a slowdown is helped by other businesses that obviously moves up. But our – the softer results is really our US consumer business. As you can recall, we announced quite some time ago came over from Marsh, we knew that we would face a tough comparison to last year in the first quarter and was anticipated in our plans that we would do so. Other things like in the US, Europe, in Asia, we have been doing a lot of work to restructure and improve the profitability of our book of administration clients as it relates to H&B. And in some cases, we ended up with a bit of low revenue but with higher margins. So in the long run, we think that that will benefit significantly as we continue to grow both top line and bottom line. So it isn’t just one thing but a lot of things coming together that result in being a quarter that’s a bit softer than we’ve been running in the past.
Dan Glaser: Thanks. Brian, your next question?
Brian Meredith - UBS: Yes. The next question I guess more for Peter. If I take a look at the growth that you’re seeing in the developed countries, EMEA and the US business, it looks like it’s kind of running in line and maybe blow nominal GDP growth. I guess my question is, for Marsh, do we just expect nominal GDP growth as kind of what you guys can grow or is there any kind of urgency out there that kind of get that – get the growth kind of picking up here?
Dan Glaser: Yes, I’m not sure about the nominal GDP growth in the US in the first quarter because I saw something in the other day that said it was 0.1. So I think we’re not going to cover off the ball, but Peter, do you have some comments?
Peter Zaffino: I agree with you. And Brian, the underlying and fundamentals of the US and Canada business as well as Europe are quite strong. We have very strong client retention, strong rollover from prior year, meaning that we’re retaining the clients that we’re adding for – from prior year for new business. We have strong new business – so overall, I don’t think the 2% is the world we want to live in and we are aspiring to do 3% or more. And to think that the underlying fundamentals support that overall longer term basis. I mean in the US, we had a couple of things that hurt us in the quarter with two large programs that are runoff – again, not an excuse but just pointing towards that the underlying fundamentals I think are stronger than the 2% and we’re optimistic in the future.
Dan Glaser: Thanks, Peter.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Thanks.
Dan Glaser: Next question, operator.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Thomas Mitchell with Miller Tabak.
Thomas Mitchell – Miller Tabak + Co., LLC: Thank you. This is just a little back of the envelope calculation but we started about $2.20 a share available for various allocations of excess cash in capital in 2013 and that’s going to go about $3.60 a share in 2014. I guess one question I have related to that is, can we expect it to stay at that level or are there reasons why it would fall back? And then secondly, on a sustained basis looking out a number of years, would you continue to see the cash flow available for different uses continue to grow although probably not at a similar pace?
Dan Glaser: Yes. It’s a good question. So basically, yes, we were looking at 2013 of having cash available for acquisition, share repurchase and dividends of about $1.2 billion. As we noted earlier, we expect that number for 2014 to be about $2.1 billion. And we believe that that kind of level is going to be available to us as we go forward beyond 2014. We also, as we grow the business both organically and inorganically, we expect to see mild increases in our cash flow as we go forward. And so that is our expectation where we are today. I mean, it’s important to know that some of the calls on cash that we had before whether it was pension or restructuring kinds of things don’t exist right now. And in our planning horizon, we’re not expecting them to.
Thomas Mitchell – Miller Tabak + Co., LLC: And that – the other question I have is sort of related, but is that availability of cash flow – and Mike might be able to detail this – is that availability something that has to be moved geographically or is it – are the opportunities to make use of it in place or are the amounts easily enough transferred that it doesn’t matter where it comes from?
Dan Glaser: I’ll start to comment and then I’ll hand over to Mike. In terms of our business, right now, about 44% of our business is in the United States, so we have significant amount of business and profitability outside of the United States. Having said that, our uses of cash include not only share repurchase and dividends but also acquisitions. And when we look around the world, we see opportunities throughout the world in both segments. And so our – I wouldn’t make the assumption that all the cash that we have around the world has to come back to the United States. And that’s where good capital management and good cash flow management come in. And Mike, do you want to –
Michael Bischoff: You’re absolutely right. And the one pressure that exists for the company is returning capital to its shareholders. And with the dividends and share repurchases that we indicated and in fact for this year, I think we’ve said at Investor Day that we’re planning about $1.3 billion of capital return to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividend. That’s obviously all US oriented. So it does mean that over not just this year but every year and going forward, we have to bring international cash back into the US in a tax-efficient manner to return capital to shareholders. We think we’ve been able to do that very judiciously in the past and we think we can do it judiciously going forward.
Thomas Mitchell – Miller Tabak + Co., LLC: That’s terrific. Thank you very much.
Dan Glaser: Cheers. Next question, operator.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Arash Soleimani with KBW.
Arash Soleimani – KBW: Hi, thank you. Just a couple quick ones here. I know you’d mentioned [indiscernible] at the Investor Day you had cancelled out some ancillary products to the exchange platform. So I’m just wondering, looking forward, what’s the margin potential there to just try and get a sense of how really [ph] that could be.
Dan Glaser: Okay. Julio, so the question is about ancillary products on Mercer Marketplace.
Julio Portalatin: All right. Thank you. As we sit back in Investor Day and in fact when we first started with Mercer Marketplace moving in this – in the direction of having a whole list of solutions for employers and employees, we started off with ensuring that we had a very good win-win value proposition for employees and employers. And we thought one way to be able to do that is to make sure that we gave a very broad breadth of options to employees to choose from. So as they choose on their core medical programs, perhaps options of higher deductibles, we wanted to make sure that ancillary products were available. We wanted to fill some of that gap like with critical illness coverages, active [ph] health coverages, et cetera. And so we continued to expand our ancillary product offers to employees to give them options that perhaps others may not offer in terms of their structure. And we continue to do that. We announced on Investor Day that about 25% of those that took higher deductibles are actually buying ancillary products. That continues to be the case. We continue to see good movement in that direction. We’ve added in addition to some of the products that I mentioned earlier, now Auto and Home that just recently launched and we don’t have any other numbers on that yet but we’ll see how that develops throughout the year and at the beginning of next year. But it is our strategy to continue to add and to bring strong decision solution tools to aid people in making decisions as to when they should be using ancillary products to subsidize some of the decisions they’re making on core medical.
Arash Soleimani – KBW: Okay, good. Thank you. And just quickly, with Oliver Wyman, I know you had also mentioned some potential cross all opportunities there. I’m just wondering if those have come to fruition and to what extent you can benefit from those as well.
Dan Glaser: Just to make sure that we have the question, were you talking about OW cross-OpCo opportunities? Or are you – I’m not sure we heard you clearly.
Arash Soleimani – KBW: I was just referring just in general to cross opportunity, yes, between Oliver Wyman and the other MMC businesses.
Dan Glaser: Okay. Okay. So let me take that because it’s really broader than Oliver Wyman. We have, as you know, two segments and four operating companies within those two segments. And when we look at it, there’s opportunities to have significant amounts of activity in support of one OpCo for the other in servicing our clients. And so, it’s not specific op to Oliver Wyman. Let me give you some examples. So outside the United States, Mercer and Marsh work jointly on employee benefits. Within the insurance company segment, Guy Carpenter and Oliver Wyman communicate regularly with regard to different types of capabilities that they can bring to insurance companies. Those are just two examples. We would have a list of a dozen. I’m always wary, though, in a company that produces the kind of business and new business that we have, this is gravy and this optimization, making sure that we don’t leave anything off the table in servicing our clients and giving them innovation and new opportunities. But when we look at our business, not only do we see advantages of being part of Marsh & McLennan Companies and advantages in our intellectual capital. So you’ll see more of that but you won’t see us combining operating companies. We believe in the strength of our present structure and the ability of each operating company to deliver value to clients and seek advice and solutions from the other operating companies as well.
Arash Soleimani – KBW: Okay, good. Thank you. That was very helpful.
Dan Glaser: Okay, cheers. Next question, please.
Operator: And at this time there are no further questions. I’d like to turn the call back over to you, sir, for any additional and closing remarks.
Dan Glaser: Okay. Well, thank you very much, operator. And I thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning. I would like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. Have a great day. Bye.
Operator: And again, that does conclude today’s conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies conference call. Today's call is being recorded. Fourth quarter and Full Year 2013 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risk and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's most recent SEC filings, which are available on the MMC website for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn the call over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Daniel S. Glaser : Thanks Sherry and good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO.  I'd also like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald, who was named CEO of Oliver Wyman Group on January 1st. Scott succeeds John Drzik who has moved to Marsh to become President of Global Risks and Specialties, overseeing Marsh's Global Industries and practices, analytics and technologies in the Insurer Consulting Group. John has also been named Chairman of the newly formed MMC Global Risk Center where he will strengthen collaboration on risk issues across the firm. This exemplifies the depth of our senior management team and our successful efforts to move talent throughout the organization. Also with us this morning is Keith Walsh, Head of Investor Relations.  I am very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which capped an excellent year for MMC. Underlying revenue growth was 4%, exceeding the increase in underlying operating expenses, as it has for 22 of the past 23 quarters, a record that stands out in the industry. Our consolidated adjusted margin rose 130 basis points to 16.3%, our highest fourth quarter margin in a decade.  In the Risk and Insurance Services segment, adjusted operating income grew 9% and the margin expanded 80 basis points to 20%. Marsh had strong underlying revenue growth of 4% in the quarter, the international operations rose 4% and the U.S. Canada division grew 3%.  Guy Carpenter generated underlying revenue growth of 6% its best performance in 2013. In the Consulting segment adjusted operating income grew 16% and the margin expanded 160 basis points to 14.9%.  Mercer grew underlying revenue 4% for the third consecutive quarter driven by outstanding results in health and investments. Oliver Wyman’s 5% increase in underlying revenue was its strongest performance in the past six quarters, reflecting significant growth in financial services.  For the year we delivered underlying revenue growth of 3% while managing underlying adjusted expense growth to 1%. This produced strong operating leverage with 14% growth in adjusted operating income and an increase in the adjusted operating margin of 180 basis points to 17.4%.  Adjusted EPS increased 15%. In 2013 each of our segments produced double-digit growth in adjusted operating income. Notably this was the fourth quarter consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted operating income and margin expansion in both segments. In recent years we've made tremendous progress in improving productivity, capturing efficiencies and reducing risk.  This progress was driven in part by investments in our businesses. One indicator of our level of investment is capital expenditures which has increased over 40% from two years ago. We are well positioned to deliver on our long-term goal of 13% annual EPS growth.  In Risk and Insurance Services revenue for 2013 was $6.6 billion with underlying revenue growth of 3% at Marsh and 5% at Guy Carpenter. Adjusted operating income increased 11% to $1.5 billion. This represents the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted operating income. The adjusted margin rose 150 basis points to 22.1%, the highest in a decade. To put the outstanding long term performance of this segment into perspective, since 2007 adjusted operating income has more than tripled and the adjusted margin has expanded by more than 1,300 basis points.  At Marsh revenue was $5.4 billion in 2013 as all major geographic regions contributed to underlying revenue growth of 3%. In the U.S. Canada division underlying growth was 2%. The international division expanded 4% as solid underlying revenue growth continue throughout Marsh's vast international footprint.  Marsh continued to produce strong levels off new business with $1.1 billion for the year a new annual record. Last week Marsh & McLennan Agency announced the acquisition of San Diego based Barney & Barney, the country's 34th largest insurance brokerage firm with 100 million of annual revenue, 500 employees, strong leadership and an outstanding record of growth. Barney & Barney will be MMA's Western regional hub.  Marsh has also continued to expand its international footprint. Recent acquisitions include the leading insurance advisors in Peru, the Dominican Republic and most recently in Scotland where Marsh acquired Central Insurance Services.  Guy Carpenter produced record revenue of $1.1 billion in 2013, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis. Three quarters of this growth came from outside of Guy Carpenter's 25 largest clients reflecting our strategy to broaden relationships by customer size and geography.  Revenue growth was broad-based across North America, international, global specialties and UK Facultative. Guy Carpenter has grown organically for 20 straight quarters with average annual underlying revenue growth of 5%. As a result of building headwinds, including record levels of capacity, higher risk retentions by clients and significant rate reductions seen in January we currently expect modest underlying revenue growth at Guy Carpenter in 2014.  In 2013 the Consulting segment continue to make substantial progress to increase profitability. Revenue was $5.7 billion, up 2% on an underlying basis. Focused expense management held underlying adjusted expenses flat, producing adjusted operating income of $847 million, an increase of 100 million or 13% from the prior year, and the segment’s margin increased 160 basis points to 14.9%.  Mercer had solid underlying revenue growth, fueling record profitability. Revenue was $4.2 billion, an underlying increase of 4% for the third consecutive year. This was driven by health and investments, which led the way with increases of 6% and 9% respectively. Growth was spread across all geographic reasons.  We have experienced success in the U.S. healthcare exchange space with the launch of Mercer marketplace which just last month became a standalone division within Mercer. Mercer marketplace has delivered a differentiated platform to both middle market and large clients. Oliver Wyman’s underlying revenue growth steadily improved throughout the year culminating with strong fourth quarter growth of 5%. For the year revenue was $1.5 billion, a modest decrease from 2012 as solid growth in financial services, Lippincott, NERA and the international regions was offset by declines in other practices.  In summary, MMC’s excellent performance in the fourth quarter and full year represents the continuation of our strong earnings momentum. We are especially proud of our record of generating consistent earnings growth.  Adjusted EPS rose 13% in 2011, 16% in 2012 and 15% this past year and over the three year period the adjusted operating margin improved 330 basis points. We are well positioned to deliver on our long term goals, which should lead to superior returns for our shareholders. With that let me turn it over to Mike.
J. Michael Bischoff: Thank you, Dan and good morning everyone. In the fourth quarter, MMC's revenue was $3.1 billion, an increase of 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income rose 13%. The consolidated margin increased 130 basis points to 16.3%, and adjusted EPS grew to $0.57 from $0.52 in the prior year. Both GAAP and adjusted EPS included $24 million of expense or $0.03 per share due to the early extinguishment of debt.  Full year result, MMC's revenue rose 3% on an underlying basis to a record $12.3 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 14%, with the margin increasing 180 basis points from 15.6% to 17.4%. GAAP EPS increased 14% and adjusted EPS grew 15%.  Investment income was $11 million in the fourth quarter. While difficult to forecast we anticipate investment income could approach $10 million in the first quarter. MMC's tax rate for the year was 30% on both the GAAP and adjusted basis, which is also appropriate to use for modeling purposes this year.  Interest expense in the fourth quarter decreased to $43 million which reflects the debt funding that occurred last fall. Most likely we will utilize the commercial paper market this quarter for the first time since 2007 and as we approach the July $320 million debt maturity we will refine our thinking concerning the amount and term of the refinancing.  Now let’s turn to MMC pension plans. We would like to update you on the funded status, cash contributions, changes to our U.K. pension plans and pension expense for the year. At the end of 2012 on a GAAP basis the net funded status of our global defined benefit plans was a deficit of $1.5 billion. At the end of 2013 this has moved to a surplus of approximately $100 million. The significant improvement was due to strong market returns, cash contributions and an increase in the discount rate of 85 basis points in the U.S.  Last year we made total cash contributions to our defined benefit plans of $650 million. The anticipated funding this year is approximately $200 million.  Changes to our UK pension plans; after an in-depth review UK retirement plans we are implementing a new defined contribution plan effective in August. We're moving from several diverse plans to one unified competitive easy offering for all UK colleagues. We anticipate very modest impact on profitability from this change.  Based upon the year-end measurement which takes into account such factors as the discount rate, asset returns, mortality, inflation, salary increases and cash contributions, annual pension expense will decrease in 2014 for the first time since 2008. We anticipate the year-over-year decline in pension expense, net of compensation considerations will be approximately $0.10 per share.  The impact of foreign exchange on MMC's operations throughout the year could partially offset this benefit. If exchange rates at the end of January hold for the remainder of the year EPS will be reduced by $0.05 per share. Less than half of this relates to our four major currencies Sterling, euro, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar. Unlike prior years the currency impact from emerging markets could be meaningful. We expect minimal impact in the first quarter from the foreign exchange with the greatest impact coming in the second quarter. In summary we believe the net result of the pension benefit and the FX impact could increase EPS by $0.05 this year.  Moving on to cash; cash on the balance sheet at year-end was $2.3 billion of which $940 million was in the United States. These cash levels anticipate payments for variable compensation, several recent acquisitions, the largest being Barney & Barney and returning capital to shareholders. Our cash utilization in the fourth quarter included a $139 million for dividends and a $150 million to repurchase 3.2 million shares marking seven consecutive quarters of share buybacks.  For the year we bought back 13.2 million shares for $550 million. We plan to continue our share repurchase program in the first quarter.  With that I'm happy to turn it back to Dan. 
Daniel S. Glaser : Thank you, Mike. And operator, we are ready to begin Q&A. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We'll have our first question from Gregory Locraft with Morgan Stanley. 
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley & Co.: Hi, good morning guys. Great quarter and great year, congratulations. 
Daniel S. Glaser : Thanks a lot, Greg.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley & Co.: Wanted to ask a bit about the organic growth, specifically in Guy Carpenter, I mean it was the best quarter of the year and your competitors are in some way showing the same not quite as strong but still decent growth also. What's the disconnect between the top line performance in global reinsurance brokerage and the pricing declines that seem so widespread across the reinsurance marketplace?  And if you could tie that to why you think you will be able to grow that business this year as you stated in your outlook that would be great. 
Daniel S. Glaser : That's great. It is Dan; I'll take the first part of that and then hand over to Alex to give a bit more detail. Let's say a few things, you have to really to really look at what has happened in reinsurance brokerage and advisory over the last number of years, five, six year period. There has been very few players who have been able to build out very strong advisory capabilities. And so it's not just the reinsurance transaction that drives results any more.  In many ways Guy Carpenter is far closer to their client, their client base than any other advisor with those clients. And so the [inaudible] of reinsurance companies come to rely very heavily on the advice and capabilities, analytic capabilities, relationship of Guy Carpenter. So it's a more balanced organization than it was in the past.  Having said that, obviously rating levels have an impact because they do participate in transactions but it maybe more muted than it had been, five or ten years ago, but Alex, you want to give us some more detail.
Alexander S. Moczarski : Yes, sure, the fourth quarter was a great quarter for us. It’s not a very big cat's quarter. And it’s really in the cat space that prices have fallen so much. First quarter is quite a strong cat quarter for us. However, the reason why we believe it will grow is one, we have a very effective segmentation strategy which has allowed us to increase our penetration in mutual market, the excess and surplus markets, our international footprints continue to grow. So we feel good that we can encapsulate some growth in this year.
Daniel S. Glaser : And one thing I would just like to say is that because January 1 is a big date and it’s a big transactional date when we’re looking at Guy Carpenter for the year we are expecting to see modest growth and are not quite sure what we will see in the first quarter. So we’re really looking at GC over the course of the year rather than in one individual quarter.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley & Co.: Okay, okay great and then shifting gears entirely towards the capital deployment, you guys bought back a lot of stock on the year at least you bought back more than you have in many years. Yet, the share count still is not yet going down. When do you expect the impact of the more aggressive share repo to impact the share count?
Daniel S. Glaser : Okay, first of all I am glad you noticed that we have been buying back more shares because that is certainly something that we are committed to and being really a consistent buyer of our own company shares is something that this management team is very interested in. Your specific question in terms of share count and vending that share count is important to us as well, and Mike, you want to give us more flavor.
J. Michael Bischoff: Yeah, I’d be more than happy to and thanks for the question, Greg, and I apologize it is going to be a little bit more detailed but I think you need to have color in how we look at it. As I talked on the third quarter call, if you go back to the end of ‘09 the overhang on potential shares outstanding because of colleague equity grants in previous years was about 69 million shares that included stocks options and restricted stock units of various kinds.  If you look at what that overhang has worked its way down to by at the end of this year it was actually 26.8 million shares. So what that meant, Greg, is that in the last few years we have seen a significant amount of stock options exercised from prior years is probably close to 13.5 million total shares, including restricted stock grants in 2012 and about 14.5 million in 2013.  So if you do the math if 14.5 million shares were required for this overhang to work down in 2013 and we repurchased 13.2 million shares the actual net change was 1.2 million. So now to go to the heart of your question, with that history and backdrop we think that the overhang has been significantly worked down. We can never totally know what the amount of stock options exercised would be in any given year. But in aggregate we are modeling for 2014 and most likely 2015 only half the levels that we saw in 2012 and 2013.  So as Dan and I have indicated we plan to continue our share repurchases program. It’s the balance with regard to other return of capital to shareholders, acquisition, investing in the business that we think we will start to bend that curve down this year.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley & Co.: Thank you. Great…
J. Michael Bischoff: Sorry, you have something else, Greg?
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley & Co.: Well, if I may just to clarify, Mike it was incredibly detailed, just roughly half of what you’ve seen in terms of the exercises, that's roughly 7 million you just bought back 13 million shares. So we should be seeing I’m just giving you the math back, you know, five plus million decrease in share count all else being equal, if you were to do the same exact buyback activity this year as before, is that what you said?
J. Michael Bischoff: That’s what I said but all else is equal the average stock price we would hope goes up this year but we can’t control that factor.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley & Co.: That’s perfect, great, thanks for the clarity.
J. Michael Bischoff: Plus I imagine that sometime in next month some of our colleagues will be expecting to receive some more shares. But fortunately we took that into account. 
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley & Co.: Great year, guys thanks. 
J. Michael Bischoff: Thank you, Greg. 
Daniel S. Glaser : Next question please. 
Operator: Larry Greenberg, Janney Capital.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Hi, Mike, just a little bit on the pension. I mean is there a big difference on the impact of financial markets on the U.S. versus the UK and is there some negotiating or messaging that goes on, on the UK side of things? And then secondly, just looking for little bit of an update on Marsh Agency and where things stand there?
Daniel S. Glaser : Okay. So Mike will handle first part of that question and we'll pass over to Peter Zaffino who will give us some more color around MMA, the Marsh McLennan agency. So Mike, pension.
J. Michael Bischoff: Thank you, Dan, Larry and let me to talk to the point Larry and if I don't specifically address your question please come back to me before we go to agencies, but if you look at our global plans there at the end of 2013 there were about $13.6 billion of assets and as I indicated about $13.5 billion of liabilities which puts us on a global basis a net surplus of $100 million. If you look at the size of respective major geographies the UK is our largest plan very over funded and assets about $7.7 billion and liabilities on a GAAP basis about $6.8 billion. The next question, the U.S. I think with regard to the mix of the assets that are allocated for the portfolios roughly in the U.S. and the UK and we've disclosed that in the 10-K but the UK is a little bit more geared towards bonds. I think it's 50% of what they call return seeking assets, heavily geared towards equities and 50% bonds. So the rate of return on those assets is typically a little bit lower than in the U.S.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Daniel S. Glaser : And just I hand over to Peter, so couple of things just around our pension, your comment about negotiations or in the UK it's probably just in the context of UK has a different format where large companies have trustees. And so Mike and his team do work with the trustees to essentially plan for fulfillment of our obligations under the pension plans in the UK and the UK trustees have their own specific responsibilities with regard to being a guardian of the UK pension plans. 
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: So is it fair to say that in the UK it's not driven quite as much by the numbers that we tend to focus on here in the U.S.?
Daniel S. Glaser : I think in the UK certainly the same sorts of issues, in terms of what's the discount rate, what's the market return, what's the return on planned assets, what is the allocation between different categories of asset classes, mortality are all similar factors. The one difference is in the UK there is an independent group of trustees who take their own view and have their own advice in terms of what all of those variables mean and taken together. UK also has different types of rules and regulations and a different measurement system where we clearly as a company look at our plans on a GAAP basis, around the world where we have DB plans. And in the UK they look not only at a GAAP basis but also on a what they call technical provision basis. 
J. Michael Bischoff:  So Dan let me just add one other thing is Larry as you can see it's extremely complex looking at the plans not only in the U.S. and the UK but I have to say we have fantastic advisors, teams on both sides of the Atlantic working with this literally almost on a daily basis and I am pleased to report these teams are part of Mercer. 
Daniel S. Glaser : Okay turning to the agency I would just like to start by saying now this has been a consistent strategy over really a five year period that we started truly executing about four years ago. So we will ultimately really reap the benefit of the agency strategy and I just think hats off to Peter and his team because the reality is in the early stages as we build out platform hub, and because we eat all of the deal cost and amortization and all of that it actually hurts Marsh’s overall NOI and the segment NOI on a margin basis.  Clearly someday when we reduce the level of amortization, which is still some years off then it will be a big help forever more, but this is a clear strategy that the management team has been executing for a number of years and so, Peter?
Peter Zaffino:  Thanks Dan and as you said it’s been a journey. We have acquired 35 agencies since 2009 and our annualized revenue is approaching approximately $600 million. As Dan had mentioned in his opening comments we’re really excited about the acquisition of Barney & Barney which is going to be MMA’s western region hub, so we have a much more of a balanced national platform now. We also made two other acquisitions in January so the momentum is quite strong.  Very pleased with the organic growth, certainly in line of what our expectations are, in line with other middle market brokers within the U.S. and believe that we’re building a platform that is going to be the premier agency in the United States over time. So we’re going to stick to the strategy of attracting high quality agencies and believe that the pipeline is strong and very optimistic of the future. 
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Do you have all your hubs in place now?
Peter Zaffino: We don't have, Larry a prescription of how many hubs we want for the national platform. I would expect us to do a couple of other acquisitions for hubs but again our geographical footprint is getting to be quite strong. So the geographic areas where we want to expand is really in a couple parts of the U.S. So I think we will do couple more hubs but again no rush. 
Daniel S. Glaser :  And the watch word for this is not really geography it's quality, so where there are quality agencies in the United States regardless of size we are interested in acquiring quality.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Great, thank you.
Daniel S. Glaser:  Next question please.
Operator: Jay Gelb, Barclays.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital:  Thank you. For the risk and insurance services segment you mentioned that Guy Carpenter growth could be somewhat slower but I am wondering if Marsh kind of continued to grow faster even though primary pricing, reinsurance pricing facing headwinds the economy is certainly recovering so does that net out to 3% or better going forward.
Daniel S. Glaser:  Yeah when we are looking at the RIS segment in total we certainly we have been in a world of 3% to 5% over the last several years and we think we still live in that world, notwithstanding the headwind that Guy Carpenter is facing.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital:  Thanks, Dan. And I believe in the past you said within that range RIS margin expansion?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, that's really right. 
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Okay, can you give us a bit more color on the underlying expense growth? I think 1% underlying growth is a pretty impressive achievement. How are you able to keep it there and that 1% maybe for the overall company, right?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yeah the 1% is for the overall company. In the fourth quarter RIS grew expenses 3% and consulting grew expenses 2%, corporate was minus 4% in the quarter. When we look at it obviously there is a lot going on under the hood. So our level of expenses is benefited by prior year actions in terms of capturing efficiency and rolling forward actions that we have already done.  The short answer is that we are spending a fair amount of money, not only on colleagues but on investing for future growth and on operational improvements. The good news is you know our search for efficiencies doesn't end. And each year we've been able to find significant areas in which we could improve the underlying performance of the company and it actually maxed our overall level of expense growth because generally when we are finding those efficiencies we are letting them roll through.  To give you a couple of ideas we significantly reduced our real estate footprint over the past five years and we used stakes a lot better than we ever had before. Another item is that we've increased the headcount in our own service center in India by over 600 people since January of 2011.  We've centralized procurement which obviously influences demand management but also gives us spend leverage. So I could go on and on there are literally dozens of items that we've done to attack all other operating expenses. And all you have to do is look at our compensation and benefits which is the leading driver of expense and our comp and ben as a percentage of revenue we finished the year at 58.8% which is stable to what it has been in the past.  And so we're letting comp and ben flow through our colleagues and within our improvements in profitability I am very proud of the fact that we've had five consecutive years of increases to the total bonus pool. 
J. Michael Bischoff: So let me just add to what Dan said you can see that we're putting a lot of investments in the business, we are putting a lot of CapEx, we're putting a lot of money in analytics. But the other side of that is that we've a goal as a management team to make MMC a great place to work. And so as a result of that we are not going to get the profit improvement on the backs of our colleagues.  As Dan said compensation is a great degree year-after-year-after-year. We're looking at other things that can make the environment more attractive for our colleagues. Even in the space reduction on real estate that Dan alluded to our global real estate teams say it's not just an issue of densification because you can fit more people into square footage business but you end up with a not as hospitable work environment.  So we've adopted a smart office concept where we look at the needs and motivational surveys with regard to our staff to make the environment that they work in much more conducive to their life styles and work styles. So overall it's a combination of not only investing in the business but making MMC a great place for our colleagues as well. 
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: I see okay. And then just switching gears, health exchange revenues for contracts signed this year all come in 2014, correct? 
Daniel S. Glaser :  Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin: They will come on as the continuation of payments come on. So we recognize it throughout the year with no big bubble effect in any one quarter. 
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Okay. But that would all be organic growth additionally in 2014, correct?
Julio A. Portalatin:  Well, keeping in mind that we have sold to clients that were both with us or with Mercer and we sold to some clients that are new to Mercer. All those clients that we've sold that were already HMB clients and Mercer clients, we do have an expansion average revenue because we are selling voluntary and ancillary products, so we do get that uplift. And then those are new-new of course you get back. So it's not all new-new coming into Mercer. 
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Thank you. 
Daniel S. Glaser : Okay. Next question, please. 
Operator: Meyer Shields, KBW. 
Meyer Shields - KBW:  Thanks, good morning. 
Daniel S. Glaser : Hi, good morning, Meyer. 
Meyer Shields - KBW: I guess I keep on hearing these reports of slowing economic growth in some emerging markets. Is that something that could temper organic growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America next year?
Daniel S. Glaser : Well, we read the same reports and clearly there is issues in the emerging markets you really have to look at country by country. It's not that the emerging market is some monolithic area that all has the same characteristics. In certain of the countries the issues are regulatory or anti-business practices, in other countries there is this political elections. I think in a number of countries in the emerging world there are elections within the next 12 months and that has created some level of activity and commentary.  Clearly when we look at our businesses the emerging market is very important to us in all four of our OpCos but no more so than in Marsh and Mercer. Having said that if you look at just the size of our company and where we get our revenue from, tell me how we're doing in the U.S. and the UK, Australia, Canada, Germany and France and I put those countries together and I'll tell you how we did as a firm.  And so the emerging market it is largely can be additive to us. The great thing about the emerging market is that you get not only the activity in the marketplace from a exposure growth standpoint, there's some mild level in certain of the countries and higher than mild in other countries of inflation. And so you get the benefits of GDP growth albeit that GDP growth in certain places may be slowing.  But you also get the benefit of increased penetration, not only of insurance but also for advisory services, that impacts Oliver Wyman and Mercer and Guy Carpenter as well. And so when we look at the emerging market it can clearly have an impact on us from a growth standpoint but we're not overly concerned with it.  We have been able to grow through good times and bad in our footprint around the world. There is a lot less competition in some of the countries in terms of having the capability that a company like Marsh & McLennan has in some parts of the emerging world. And so there is a series of puts and takes but overall we're not overly concerned.  Mike brought out in his commentary earlier how for the first time in a real long time the emerging market's weakness against the dollar could have an impact on us this year. So thankfully we've got some tailwinds on pension that will offset that potential weakness in foreign exchange. 
Meyer Shields - KBW: Okay. Thank you, that's very helpful. And if I can change topic briefly, if I look anecdotally at the deals announced by some of the acquisitive brokers in established markets, there seemed to be may be an above average number of brokerages the size of Barney & Barney that are for sale. Is that a legitimate observation and is that likely to benefit MMA as an acquirer of hubs or may be additional hubs in current areas? 
Daniel S. Glaser : I'll take that initially and then I'll hand over to Peter to give some more comments. If you look at all of the major brokers really there are products of acquisitions over a long period of time and certainly when you look at Marsh & McLennan Company, all the way back to Henry Marsh and Donald McLennan who came together and formed Marsh & McLennan we have proven to be a very good acquirer over a long period of time. And there is periods of time either through concerns about regulation path, compliance et cetera and there also generational periods of time where certain agencies come up in different parts of the world. I think clearly what we have done is built the company not a franchise but a company in Marsh & McLennan Company which is attractive as a buyer.  And so we don't jump into processes and buy something we cultivate relationships over the long periods of times and when we look at acquisitions whether it's in risk and return services segment or any other segment the first thing that we're thinking about is how does it make us better, how does it give us capability that we don’t currently possess what does it give us in terms of either geography or segment that we don't currently have.  And so that's our thought process and then after that it's very much in terms of -- their chemistry between the teams and is there a cultural fit. The terms and conditions are largely an after thought of when everything else slots into place. But Peter do you have any other views here? 
Peter Zaffino: That was very comprehensive and so I would just add that many of the acquisitions that we have made, the agencies have not been for sale. It's just really cultivating relationships over a period of time and making sure that they're aligned with the strategic intent of what we're trying to build. So I will keep that in mind. I mean our pipeline is strong as I mentioned before but as Dan mentioned it's really cultivating the relationships and we've been doing that over several years.  So I haven't seen any more activity in terms of access for sale than we have over a period of time. I think we've been doing a much better job of proactively working with potential acquired assets and it has worked out quite well.
Meyer Shields - KBW: Okay, fantastic. That was very helpful.
Daniel S. Glaser:  Thanks. Next question please.
Operator: Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC : Hi, good morning. I was hoping that we could talk more about what you guys are seeing in terms of the economic conditions within the U.S. in particular any changes with exposure changes and how that impacted the organic revenue growth that did pickup in the quarter? And also just in terms of what your expectations are for the U.S. in 2014 as well?
Daniel S. Glaser:  Okay so I will take the first part of that and then I will hand off to Scott McDonald to just talk about macro issues little bit in the U.S. and even in other parts of the world, if we might expand that out.  So economic conditions are clearly an impact because they drive exposure whether it’s in really in all four of our operating companies, you take Marsh clearly areas around construction or economic activity drive some of the values that are used as the exposure base. Payrolls could be rising, which certainly impacts workers comp as well as Mercer.  So when we look at GDP overall we have been bouncing along the bottom and have been well we have been in a phase which we call the grinded out years which is essentially low levels of GDP growth in the developed world including the United States and a cautiousness around expansion that we believe in a lot of ways still exists and so clearly something that may have been a light headwind might be a light tailwind but it’s certainly not buoyant out there and there is still lot of concerns throughout the market and so an awful lot of companies have cash on the balance sheet which they are not putting to work.  Having said all of that exposure units is just one of several factors that drive out our performance. I mean whether our revenue retention and account retention, very important, new business, as you mentioned GDP growth also interest rates also P&C types of pricing and so there is a number of factors that drive our performance and the exposure units are just one of them. Scott you want to give us a little bit more flavor from Oliver Wyman’s perspective?
Scott McDonald:  Sure. Oliver Wyman tends to be or at least our pipeline tends to be a pretty good indicator of the economy and based on what we see across clients, across sectors and region what we are looking at for 2014 is continued growth and activity in the U.S. I think this is supported by the really strong bounce back we had in Q4 with our U.S. business and that was pretty consistent across industries.  We see continued stabilization in Europe and as Dan highlighted earlier some increased volatility in developed markets, driven by a number of things, including the tapering uncertainties around Chinese growth and the many idiosyncratic things that Dan mentioned earlier.  One point of caution on the U.S. that I'll mentioned is that much of the work we did in the second half of 2013, even as our business improved was driven by cost cutting, efficiency projects and restructuring rather than projects focused on growth initiatives and that suggests to us that many companies, particularly in the U.S. are still cautious going into 2014, they are still holding cash and we may not be in a booming period yet. 
Daniel S. Glaser:  Thank you.
Elyse Greenspan – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC :   Okay, thank you, very helpful. And then just switching about to healthcare exchanges quickly following on the 2013 enrollment fee there how would you just kind of describe the growth structuring and any initial comments I guess pointing towards 2014 from some conversations that you might have already with either existing or potential new clients for your platform?
Daniel S. Glaser:  Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin: I will take that. Thank you. You know our pace of sales continues giving -- and given our significant reach in both the mid-market and the large accounts we are seeing conversations beyond just traditional calendar year and that pace of conversations continues to increase. Since our last update as an example on client accounts and lives we have sold additional clients on the Mercer place. To give you an idea our last update I think was in our October call when we spoke about 220,000 lives. We are up to 270,000 lives now, that includes retirees as well as active across 64 companies.  And we are pleased -- we are really pleased with the progress. I think you will see that -- that will continue to be the case, pipeline looks strong. We will continue to have good concentrated discussions as to timing with our clients. We want to make sure we balance that well to their needs and we are seeing some really good uplift. When everything is said and done we have always said and always been very clear that the impact on revenue in 2014 will be modest but over a long period of time we see this as being something that is going to really help and our ability to grow and to satisfy our client needs. 
Elyse Greenspan – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC : Okay. Thank you very much and congrats on a great quarter. 
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you very much. Next question, please. 
Operator: Jay Cohen, Bank of America. 
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay.
Jay Adam Cohen – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes, thank you. Good morning. 
Daniel S. Glaser: Good morning. 
Jay Adam Cohen – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Couple of questions. Barney & Barney you talked about the revenue that they had. Is there any seasonality there as we model this, we assume that comes in fairly evenly over the course of the year?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. I am not much sure if we have that level of depth in that -- in this room on that. I mean we are talking about a $100 million as part of $12.3 billion, so I am not sure it would be that impactful either way but do you have any flavor. 
J. Michael Bischoff:  I think it's fairly even but I'd like to caution that we haven't delved into the details of each quarter but I think it is -- there is no real seasonality from what we hear today. 
Daniel S. Glaser: And Marsh's quarterization is very interesting. You have got really three quarters which have about 26% in the third quarter which is their shortest quarter, is 23%. So it's really even throughout the whole year quarter-by-quarter except for the third quarter. 
Jay Adam Cohen – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Right, okay. The other question was on corporate expenses, were kind of well below the run rate from the first three quarters of the year. Is this a new level that we should think about or should we think about more kind of full year numbers as we base -- as we look at 2014?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Well it is true that for the year corporate expenses are 8% lower than the prior year. That was driven largely by efficiency and also because we eliminated the Group President position. Mike, you want to give that some more flavor? 
J. Michael Bischoff : And for very good reason. Yeah thanks, Dan, thank Jay. So corporate quarterly expenses Jay can move around quarter-to-quarter. So you are really asking what is an appropriate run rate for the year. I would take our corporate expenses overall not much differently in 2014 than 2013. So you could be looking at roughly $44 million to $45 million a quarter. I would say that's the part that you see, there is larger part on shared services that's allocated to the operating companies and speaking to what Dan alluded to earlier our drive for efficiency to continue to find ways to reduce cost, we will continue to do that.  But with regard to corporate expenses in the neighborhood of a $175 million to $180 million for the year is probably good for modeling purposes. Thanks. 
Jay Adam Cohen – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great, thanks a lot. 
Daniel S. Glaser: Thanks. I think we have time for one or two more questions, so next question please operator. 
Operator: Brian Meredith, UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS : Yeah, good morning. I'll be quick here. Mike I am wondering if you could just chat a little bit about cash usage as you look into 2014 particularly with savings from the pension. Should we expect an increase in CapEx that's going to go to share buyback, acquisitions kind of what is your thoughts there?
Daniel S. Glaser: Mike?
J. Michael Bischoff : Okay. Thank you, Dan. Thanks, Brian and good morning. So that -- upgrade because we are in a position of having an enormous amount of operating cash flow, lot of questions with regard to cash utilization, capital structure, where is this balanced and where do we seem to direct it and we really can't wait for you to have come and hear in more depth at Investor Day on March 11. How is that? 
Brian Meredith - UBS : Thanks. 
J. Michael Bischoff : All the secrets of the temple will be revealed on March 11. 
Brian Meredith - UBS : All right. The second question just quickly I am curious 
Brian Meredith - UBS: All right. We will be waiting. Second question just quickly I am curious you've kind of provided with your thoughts on commercial lines pricing on a global basis with some of your recent releases. Is it possible to kind of parse that out as far as what you are seeing at Marsh Agency versus kind of the global basis there is kind of different commercial lines of pricing dynamics going on in that business? 
Daniel S. Glaser: So we don't have Peter address that a bit and then if I move it over to Alexander Moczarski and he talk from a reinsurance perspective. And I only say that because after 30 years in the business often times what you see in reinsurance you end up seeing in the primary market within 12 months or so. And so Peter why don't we start with you? 
Peter Zaffino: Okay. As a macro overview we've seen slight headwinds in the international and modest benefit in the U.S. If you break that down into agency that would be consistent -- they've seen a modest tailwind. But one line of business that seems to still be receiving rate increase every quarter has been worker's compensation. So that is the one that has the same result.  So and then some segments within professional liabilities. So agency had a mild benefit in the quarter and in the year. 
Brian Meredith - UBS: Okay. Thanks. 
Alexander S. Moczarski : Okay. So probably we've been talking about capital coming into the cash base, so $40 billion that are either tied back to your pension capital, tied together with stronger balance sheet of reinsurance companies as the economies improve, tied together with centralized buying. All indication are that on the prices -- getting establish throughout that are upwards, we've seen that as a result of the cat pressure the reinsurers have become more flexible on the offerings that they're providing around other lines of business they sort of overlap.  So it would indicate that there is no pressure to push prices up at this moment. 
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. I think we have time for one more question please. 
Operator: Paul Newsome Sandler O'Neil. 
J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.: Thank you. And congratulations on the quarter. Just a quick one. On the exchanges does the announcements that allow these insurance companies are going to lose money on their exchanges impact your position in that business in anyway?
Daniel S. Glaser: Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin: Yeah, there is -- one thing that you can count on is there is going to continue to be evolving changes that how ACA is going to impact both our clients and carriers. And that's why I think anyone thing is difficult to point to as far as where the impact is going to be. As an example we all know that just announced that there is going to be some changes to the mandate for medium size companies 15 to 99 employees will have the next year now through 16 while large companies 99 plus will have to also coverage up to 70% of the employees instead of 95 which was prior to that. And that's continuing to change.  So when you think about carriers that was always an assessment that was made earlier on as far as what carrier rate should be on exchanges, on public exchanges we're talking about now as opposed to private exchanges, much difference, two different sets of discussions, on the public exchanges and the assumption that you would get an adequate distribution of risk and that distribution of risk has not materialized. So whether or not it was in public exchange or just regulatory medical when distribution of risk has not materialized yet to review your rate levels you have to make decisions as what the right rates will be next year. And so the impact will be what it is, whatever that impact is as a result of those changes distributions between expected and reality. 
Daniel S. Glaser: So I think just to some it up the core point is there is a huge difference between public and private exchanges in the Mercer marketplace which is a private exchange carrier and know who their customers are going to be and can rate them appropriately and so the private -- a lot of the things that you are reading from insurance companies losing money on exchanges is their comments with regard to the public exchanges. 
Julio A. Portalatin: That's right. And then if I just can add one more thing also on the private exchanges keep in mind the Mercer marketplace in particular offers both a fully insured and self-insured option which means it's wide open for people to consider private exchange Mercer marketplace as an option. 
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Does that answer your question, Paul? 
J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.: It did indeed, thank you. 
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Thank you. Okay. So I would like to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning. We look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day which will be held on March 11th as Mike mentioned at the Pierre Hotel in New York. We will provide more insight into MMC's growth and financial strategies, including presentations from the CEOs of each operating company. Finally I would like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. Have a good day.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies conference call. Today's call is being recorded. Third quarter 2013 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risk and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's most recent SEC filings, which are available on the MMC website for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. And now I'll turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO. I'd also like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh, Head of Investor Relations. Following my comments, Mike will discuss our financial results in more detail, and then we'll take your questions. Before I turn to the quarter, I would like to take a moment to recognize our Vice Chairman, David Nadler, who will retire at year-end after 13 years with the company. David leaves MMC with my personal appreciation, as well as that of our executive committee and the Board of Directors for a job exceedingly well done. Marsh & McLennan's performance in the third quarter included 15% growth in adjusted operating income. This result underscores our journey to be an elite company, as we successfully execute our 4-pillar strategy to create sustainable long-term shareholder value. As a global growth company, the first pillar of our strategy is to grow revenue and earnings. We have consistently delivered underlying revenue growth. We have also steadily expanded adjusted EPS in recent years, including increases of 13% in 2011, 16% last year and 17% through 9 months of this year. At the same time, we continued to execute on our other 3 pillars by maintaining low capital requirements, intelligently managing the risk profile of the firm and generating strong free cash flow. Our results reflect significant investment in our businesses that we absorb on an ongoing basis. In addition, an increasing portion of our growing cash flow is available for dividends, acquisitions and share repurchase. We believe a balanced approach to deployment of capital will contribute to long-term earnings growth and maximize total return to shareholders. Now let's look at our third quarter results in more detail. Both Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting delivered double-digit growth in adjusted operating income and excellent margin improvement, as they have each quarter this year. Our consolidated adjusted margin rose 150 basis points to 14.1%. Underlying revenue growth again exceeded the increase in underlying operating expenses as it has for 21 of the past 22 quarters. We expect to continue to achieve operating leverage while making investments across our businesses. The operational improvements we have embedded over the last several years have led to higher colleague productivity, efficiencies in our global real estate footprint and reduce professional liability costs. At the same time, we are continuously investing in areas that will support future growth and drive additional efficiencies. We are investing in growth markets and new offerings, building sales capacity, expanding distribution, creating innovative analytical platforms and capabilities, and making strategic hires and acquisitions. We are confident we have a powerful engine to generate revenue and earnings growth in both segments. Risk and Insurance Services produced another quarter of excellent profitability, as adjusted operating income rose 14%. Underlying revenue increased 3% at Marsh and 5% at Guy Carpenter. The adjusted margin expanded to 15.2%, the segment's highest third quarter margin in a decade, and an increase of 130 basis points from the prior year. At Marsh, revenue was $1.2 billion, as all major geographic regions contributed to 3% underlying revenue growth. The international division expanded 6%, led by growth of 15% in Latin America, 7% in Asia Pacific; and 3% in EMEA. In the U.S./Canada division, underlying growth was 1%. Revenue growth was driven by client revenue retention supported by strong new business, which totaled over $250 million in the third quarter. Guy Carpenter continued its solid financial performance and long-term trend of underlying revenue growth. Revenue was $262 million in the third quarter, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis. This is an impressive performance in an environment where Guy Carpenter is experiencing higher risk retentions by clients and softening pricing conditions. Growth was broad-based across North America, International, Global Specialties and U.K. facultative, led by double-digit gains in Continental Europe, Canada and Global Marine. Consulting's performance in the third quarter was outstanding. Revenue was $1.4 billion, up 4% on an underlying basis, the segment's best performance in the last 5 quarters. Adjusted underlying expense growth of 1% reflects the benefit of prior actions and expense control. This produced adjusted operating income of $231 million, an increase of 13%, marking the segment's third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And the segment's margin increased 150 basis points to 16%, Consulting's highest third quarter margin in its history. This marked improvement has occurred while navigating challenging macroeconomic conditions. Mercer had an excellent third quarter. Revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of 4% on an underlying basis. Health and Investments continued to lead the way with increases of 5% and 8%, respectively. Retirement had an increase in project work, resulting in 2% growth and talent grew 2% as well. Growth was achieved across all geographic regions. In October, Mercer announced that it had signed up 52 employers onto its private U.S. health care exchanges. Since that time, Mercer has signed up an additional 4 employers, and now has 34 that will offer benefits through Mercer Marketplace, its active exchange, and 22 employers that are offering Mercer's Medicare retiree exchange solution. In total, Mercer's exchanges will cover over 220,000 employees, retirees and family members for 2014. Oliver Wyman returned to positive revenue growth in the third quarter, with underlying revenue increasing 2% to $365 million. The revenue increase was driven by Financial Services, Oliver Wyman's largest practice, which represents approximately 40% of its revenue. Oliver Wyman's sequential improvement in revenue performance was broad-based across major regions, including North America and Europe. In summary, MMC's performance in the third quarter and through the first 9 months of the year was excellent. Our results show that the company's strong earnings momentum continues. We will host an Investor Day in New York on March 11, where we will provide more insight into MMC's operational and financial strategies. We hope you will join us. With that, let me turn it over to Mike.
J. Michael Bischoff: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, MMC's revenue was $2.9 billion, an increase of 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 15%. The consolidated margin increased 150 basis points to 14.1%, and adjusted EPS grew 18% to $0.46. These results are on top of 18% growth in adjusted EPS in the third quarter of last year. With investment income was $0.01 higher than anticipated in the quarter, this was more than offset by a higher tax rate that negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.02. For the 9 months of this year, MMC's revenue was $9.1 billion, an increase of 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 15%, with the margin increasing 190 basis points from 15.8% to 17.7%. GAAP EPS for the 9 months increased 14% to $1.89, and adjusted EPS grew 17% to $1.91. Investment income. The recognition of carried interest from Trident III led to investment income of $14 million this quarter. While it is difficult to forecast, we anticipate approximately $10 million of investment income in the fourth quarter. Taxes. The corporate tax rate in the U.K. was reduced in July. While this will benefit us going forward, the value of our U.K. deferred tax asset was reduced, which is the main reason for the increase in this quarter's tax rate to 32.4%. MMC's tax rate for the first 9 months of this year was 30.2%, which is more representative of our underlying tax rate. Interest expense in the third quarter decreased from $44 million last year to $40 million this quarter. When we funded our $250 million debt maturity in February from available cash, we indicated that we planned to enter the debt markets later in the year. In September, the company issued $500 million of debt, comprised of $250 million of 5-year senior notes and $250 million of 10-year maturities. Additionally, proceeds from the new debt issuance were used in October to redeem $250 million of our existing senior notes due in 2015. This new funding allowed us to refinance at lower interest rates, while at the same time extending the average maturity of our debt portfolio. The cost of the early extinguishment of the 2015 debt was $24 million or $0.03 per share. This expense will be included in both GAAP and adjusted fourth quarter results. Cash utilization. Cash on the balance sheet at quarter end was $2.2 billion. The increase from last quarter reflects strong operating cash flows in the $500 million debt financing. Our cash utilization in the third quarter included $150 million to repurchase 3.6 million shares of stock, marking 6 consecutive quarters of share buybacks. Year-to-date, we have purchased 10 million shares of our stock for $400 million. Also, in the quarter, approximately $140 million of cash was used for dividends, which reflects the recent 9% dividend increase and $20 million related to acquisitions. With that, I am happy to turn it back to Dan.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Mike. So operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Mike Zaremski with Crédit Suisse.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: In Risk and Insurance Services, U.S. and Canadian organic growth has been trending very, very low single digits on an organic basis. Could you talk to the market dynamics and outlook, and also how Marsh & McLennan agencies middle markets strategy has been impacting the segment's growth rate?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay, so first of all, I'll just say that in the RIS segment, we have Marsh and we have Guy Carpenter and your question is really pertaining more to Marsh than it is to the entire segment. So I'll hand off to Peter who can give us a little bit more detail.
Peter Zaffino: Sure. Thanks, Dan. First, I'd like to highlight some of the real strong performance we had in the quarter and year-to-date. Latin America, as Dan said in his opening, we had 15% growth. Asia-Pac was 7%, and despite economic headwinds in EMEA, we had 3%. We recognize in the U.S. /Canada division, we have had modest growth at 1% in the quarter. It's a seasonably low quarter for Marsh and the U.S./Canada division. We have had in the quarter some negative variability from some of the programs we have within the segment, and we would expect growth to be higher in the future than what we have reported in this particular quarter. Some of the fundamentals are quite strong. New business through the 9 months is up year-over-year, and as we mentioned, we had record new business when we look at the comparables year-over-year. So overall, again, it's been a little bit lumpy. If you look at our comparisons to competitors, you have to remember we don't report Latin America in our U.S./Canada division, and also employee Health & Benefits for the core brokerage in the U.S. is reported in Mercer. To answer the second part of your question on agency, they've had good organic growth, where we would expect them to be in line with their comparables in the middle market in the U.S. So they've been growing organically, have been making a contribution, and exactly where we thought they would be on the revenue and margins at this point in time.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. Lastly, this is probably for Mike Bischoff. Is there any kind of sensitivity or you can give us around the pension-related expenses and cash contributions? If the assumptions are changed at the end of the year. I believe since the plans are open, there could be a material impact to the expense level, as well, running to the income statement?
Daniel S. Glaser: So Mike, you want to take that?
J. Michael Bischoff: Sure, I'd be happy to. You're absolutely right on 2 categories. First, pension expense and second, contributions into our pension plans. Let me deal with the pension expense first to put it into context. The main driver of the change in pension expense on a GAAP basis year-over-year is interest rates, and over the last 5 years, we've seen interest rates go down dramatically. I should say, this is more in the immediate -- intermediate and longer-term rates, where the discount rate is calculated. And we've absorbed through our P&L approximately $250 million of additional pension expense during that time period. So your question is very appropriate. What's the outlook going forward? Well, the irony of pension expense accounting is that you do a measurement at year-end, and so you don't take the average where interest rates or the discount rate would be over the course of the year. You do it at year-end. And for that reason, it's very hard to anticipate where pension expense would be. I would just point you to -- say that there's 2 interest rates that you should track. One is obviously the U.S. rate and the other one is the U.K. rate because we have a very large U.K. pension plan. The second part of your question deals with cash contributions into the plan, and you can see that we're on track, including the pre-funding of some of our obligations to fund about $650 million into our global pension plans this year. We would think that, that would be markedly reduced for 2 reasons. At this point in time, we do not plan to make any discretionary contributions into our global plans. And as we've indicated, $250 million of the funding for this year was dedicated to pre-funding of future obligations in the U.K. that would cover the '14, '15 and '16 time period.
Operator: And we'll go next to Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wanted to ask about the -- your healthcare exchange initiative. Really 2 questions around that. First, your large competitor has -- is guiding to a lot of seasonality in their Consulting segment, and partially due to the way the revenues flow in, revenues and costs flow due to health care exchanges. Do you have similar seasonality as they do? Therefore, it might be a big fourth quarter. And where will we see that, which division should we be modeling that in? And then the other question in healthcare exchange just could you compare and contrast your initiative relative to others in the marketplace?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay, Julio, so the first question first.
Julio A. Portalatin: Okay, thank you. I'm going to start off by saying that we have a large business, of course, in total Mercer. That's right over $4 billion of revenue. Any movement in the exchange in 1 quarter or the other would have some impact, but not significant impact in the overall results in Mercer. It's a very large organization. But specific to your question about whether or not you're going to see a fourth quarter bump or not in revenue, so let me just say, simply, no. Even though a lot of the work and a fair amount of work is done in all of our H&B business that we work on in the third and fourth quarter of this year, the actual exchange contracts themselves incept on January 1, in this case, 2014. So the revenue will be earned throughout the 2014 year, and so there will be little -- in fact, there'll be no revenue in fourth quarter 2013, and then there will be an appropriate revenue throughout the year in 2014.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Julio. And the second question was, if I paraphrase, Greg, how would you compare Mercer Marketplace with the competitive offerings in the market?
Julio A. Portalatin: Yes, great question, Greg. Because I know with everything that's going on, sometimes, it's difficult to see whether there's distinctive factors. I want to really focus on a couple of things that I think has been out there, and first, allow me to level-set a bit. Mercer Marketplace supports both a fully-insured and self-insured funding model and funding models. Mercer Marketplace also offers a panel of carriers for either structure. Mercer Marketplace offers core medical. And in addition to core medical, also voluntary and ancillary products. Of our clients on the platform to date, roughly about 75% of them have chosen fully-insured model, and the remainder have chosen self-insured model. This is a reflection of the more middle market representation in our book. Generally, mid-market companies have fully-insured, and they've chosen to continue that fully-insured under the Mercer Marketplace model. Our larger clients, again, determined that they are most advantaged by staying in self-funded options, and they continue to use those under Mercer Marketplace. Even in an active exchange, no matter what the model, each employer group is rated separately. So in our exchange, we ensure that competitive pricing is taking place for each one of our clients, as we work with carriers to design programs for them and their group. A self-insurance funding model tends to be lower cost overall for larger groups due to savings on risks, changes, as well as premium taxes. And so these advantages don't necessarily go away when you go on to the exchange. So overall, when you combine what we believe is a very large availability of choice, we have up to -- we have 30 carriers, as an example on our particular exchange. Some of them, of course, work just in the core medical space, and some of them in the ancillary and voluntary space. When you compare all those advantages, we think we're very well-positioned as we look at the competition and the future.
Daniel S. Glaser: Perfect. Thank you, Julio.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, thanks, and then one quick follow-up on that is just can you remind us what the economic model is around the exchanges, both from a revenues and a margins perspective?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin: Okay. Thank you, Dan. We have had a -- there's a lot of discussion going on and speculation about how big this market is going to be in time, and certainly, and how quickly it's going to develop. I'm not going to get too crazy about the speculation of that. I'll leave that for others. But based on what we have seen in our own book and through this sales season, I think we know that there's significant interest by our clients. I think the concept is obviously something that generates that interest, and the trend is certainly here to stay. That said, it's anyone's guess as to how big this also will become, and no matter what the outcome, we think we're very well-positioned. So as Dan mentioned earlier, we're very pleased with the clients that we've sold in the first year so far. And we're pleased with the pipeline that's developing, not only for '15, but also for mid-year '14 and we've been pretty consistent in saying that while we expect these changes to be a contributor to revenue and earnings, in the medium term, in the short-term, the impact will be modest.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thanks, Julio.
Operator: And we'll go next to Larry Greenberg with Janney Capital.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Couple of questions. One, can you talk a little bit about the turnaround in the organic at Oliver Wyman? And how much of that might be Europe coming back? And then, just to stay with Julio, you're driving a really strong margin improvement, and we know you're spending money on investment initiatives and we're all fixated on the health care exchanges, but just wondering if you might be able to comment on some of the other initiatives you have in place that may be pretty specifically directed towards margin improvement.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay, Larry. So let's start with John on the turnaround. I'm not sure we would use that same word in terms of a full turnaround, but we're happy to see positive growth return. And I only say that because when we think about turnaround, we generally think about profitability as well, and John and his team have done a really superb job of fighting through some struggles on the top line and maintained it on the bottom line. And so from that standpoint, it's hats off to John and his team. But John, you want to talk about the return to growth?
John P. Drzik: Sure. As Dan said, Larry, in his opening comments, our performance has been steadily improving through the year, and business has actually been strengthening in all of our major regions. So to your question, Europe has contributed to that growth, and we do see improved conditions in Europe and expect that to be sustained. North America has also contributed, as has our international market. So overall, we're seeing growth -- or improvement across-the-board, and we expect that improvement to sustain. So looking ahead, based on the pipeline we're seeing, we expect to sustain positive revenue growth in Q4, and have good momentum going into 2014 in all of our major markets.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay, and then turning to Julio, and I'd just start by saying that we've been really pleased with both of our segments. I mean, with Marsh and Guy Carpenter, we started margin improvements several years ago, and that has created its own momentum and has sustained itself and we have every expectation that the Consulting segment, albeit in its second year of significant margin improvement, will sustain margin improvements in the future. So Julio, do you want to take that?
Julio A. Portalatin: Thanks, Dan. The third quarter represented another quarter of solid performance for Mercer. We continue to execute on our growth initiatives. We're delivering against our strategic priorities, and we're generating increasing earnings and margins just as we have, really, over the last several quarters. Our revenue, as you know, is up 4%. The areas that we continue to see improvement in are the ones we're investing in. Of course, the health area and investment business overall. We're also seeing some good growth coming from our growth markets initiatives to expand internationally, and we're seeing the beginning fruits of that labor. And we're also seeing good margin improvement as well in those same areas, where we traditionally had done some investments in different ways in the past. We continue to carefully manage expenses as you can imagine. I mean, you go in an organization, you have opportunity to really take a bird's eye view on what's going on. You make assessments where you need to disinvest. And at the same time, you make assessments where you need to invest more, and we've been doing that and calibrating that over the last couple of years, and that's also going to be a discipline that we'll continue to do as time goes on. As far as specific areas of investment that we're making in our business, we continue to be very focused on ensuring that when we think about investments, we think about them in short, medium and long-term ways, and so exchanges obviously is one thing that we've talked about, and I'm sure we'll continue to talk about as time goes on. But talent, client -- talent and client-facing technology is very important to us, as well, and we've put a lot of breadth of improvement, especially in an area that's like data and surveys. We see good margins there, and obviously, we're investing in those areas to bring that to be a larger portion of our portfolio. We're taking legacy systems, and we're obviously retiring some, investing in new generation systems. Salesforce.com was a big investment for us. We think that we'll be able to enhance our broadening of client relationships through having a good CRM tool, which also will continue to improve margin, and hopefully top line overtime. Retirement Studio, which is an enabling vehicle for us to be able to do some additional actuarial work for retirement. Strategic hires, expansion and geographic growth areas like emerging markets that I mentioned earlier. And platforms to expand our delegated Investment Solutions, and you see that continuing to move in the right direction, profitably. So all these things, I think, are things that we continue to look at, continue to invest. We continue to calibrate appropriately, again, disinvestment and investment. We'll continue to do that and run the company in a disciplined manner.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay, thanks Julio. Next question, please?
Operator: And we'll go next to Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Of the roughly $2.2 billion of free cash in the balance sheet, can you give us the mix of international versus U.S. cash currently? And then could you also talk about the outlook for getting cash from the international subs to the U.S. as we move through the rest of the year?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Mike, do you want to handle that?
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes, the $2.2 million of cash at the end of the quarter -- I'm sorry, $2.2 billion. Yes, where'd that extra money go, anyway? Of that $2.2 billion, there's actually $2,174,000,000. $250 million of it, as I indicated, was paid down in October for funding the 2015 debt. And so when you look at our remaining cash, what we typically do during this time period is you see it grow because we're working towards the first quarter with regard to bonus payments. So it's very typical for us to have higher levels of cash, not only at the end of the third quarter, but at the end of the fourth quarter. But going to the heart of your question, you'll also notice on a year-over-year basis, our cash is down when you look at it quarter-to-quarter, not sequentially. And the reason for that is that we are and have had a strategy to bring back in a tax-efficient manner our international cash for U.S. funding purposes, and those funding purposes are acquisitions in the U.S., dividends and share repurchase. And so we're the process of moving more of our international funds, even as I'm speaking now, into the U.S. for share repurchase and for looking at bonus payments in the first quarter. So overall, we're working down our excess cash. We're bringing it into the U.S. in a tax-efficient manner, and it's a very good story with regard to returning capital to shareholders.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Can you give the mix of how much is U.S. now or is it more appropriate to wait till fourth quarter, given you're in the process?
J. Michael Bischoff: I think it's probably more appropriate to wait. I have right in front of me the Treasury sheet that gives me on a daily basis what our mix is between the U.S. and global. So I have that information, but I think it's probably just best to wait.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thanks, Mike. Any other questions, Dan?
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Yes. Just also just on your -- just with regard to Guy Carpenter, I was wondering if you could talk about the outlook for growth going forward. I mean, you've had continued nice organic there. And I think your competitors have as well, maybe better than I would've thought, given some potential headwinds there that we're seeing on pricing. But maybe if you could talk about the outlook, and then also maybe other revenue opportunities that could emerge because of some of the changes in the marketplace.
Daniel S. Glaser: Alex, you want to take that?
Alexander S. Moczarski: Sure. As you say, we've been on a good run of organic growth for quite a while. And despite, I would say, headwinds during all that, and I think that stands to the quality of our people, the quality of our offering and the fact that we have good discipline. We've widened our net. We've segmented our client base, and we're coming up with discreet value propositions for each of those areas. I would point out a mutual segment that's very successful and E&S segment that we've just opened up. We've invested in Accident and Health, which we see as a growth area, of course, and areas such as agriculture, as well as overseas. So we think that there is room to grow. We think that we're the employer of choice. We've got the best people. We're investing, and we will continue to grow, we believe.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thanks, Alex.
Operator: And we'll go next to Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: If I can follow up on that question. Does the -- I guess, recent merger of 2 slightly smaller reinsurance brokerages, does that change the competitive dynamics in your reinsurance markets?
Alexander S. Moczarski: Clearly there's a change because something just happened, but we'll continue to -- we respect our competitors, but we're focused on our clients and focused on growing, focused on having the best people investing right, and that's what we'll continue to do. So we're not blind, we keep our eyes open, but we move ahead.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay, fair enough.
Daniel S. Glaser: And we generally -- Meyer, we generally think competition is a good thing. Competition keeps us on our toes, and makes sure that we're always innovating and creating additional value for clients. And so we have a lot of respect for our competitors, but we believe our proposition is unique.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Yes, and the results have certainly been there. One quick numbers question, can we get a sense of how many shares are typically issued over the course of the year for compensation?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure, absolutely. And I would just say in a broader sense, we're now in passing our sixth consecutive quarter of share repurchase. When we were talking with you, I guess about 18 months ago, we committed to meaningful share repurchase, and we're following through on that. And our view is that, as we go forward, our uses of cash would very much remain continuing to invest in our business, although that's usually not lumpy because we've been doing it on a pretty consistent basis, our dividend, and growing our dividend year-by-year as we grow our earnings on some basis, maybe not fully aligned with that, but certainly in the ballpark, acquisitions, and then share repurchase. And so Mike, do you want to take the specific question about the actual share count?
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes, Dan. I'd be happy to do that. But I think it probably is good to put into context what you were describing, which is really what's the aggregate level of shares outstanding that we had with regard to our stock options and the restricted stock unit, so essentially, what was the overhang. And if you go back on -- and look at as recently as the end of '09. When you combine those 2, the overhang that we were dealing with or looking at was 69 million shares that would, we think, eventually come into the market, and we would deal with that. And if you look at it at the end of the third quarter, which is more specific to your question, the number is 31 million shares. So over the course of the last few years, we've really been absorbing and catching up with this overhang. So when we look at it, not only for this year -- and I'll give you a little bit of a projection on it, but going forward, we really feel that, in aggregate, we have to make up -- we're looking at about 15 million of shares issuance this year for the restricted stock. But predominantly a stock option exercise, dealing with, for many years, we had very limited exercise of stock options. But now, it's fairly high. And we think that for this year, it will be about 10 million. So specifically answering. Your question, the 14 million or 15 million shares that we're going to be dealing with this year. About 10 million of it is just with regard to stock options that are being exercised, and the rest is just restricted stock, so really not a large number. And then we think after this year, and like I said, a little bit of projection, but we think after this year, the heavy overhang is behind us, and the uses or requirements for restricted stock and option exercise will decline significantly. So now just completing what Dan was saying, we think we're through the most of the catch-up. And if we continue meaningful share repurchase, which is our intent, we'll flatten out the share count, and perhaps even turn it downward.
Operator: And we'll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: First one for Mike, just to isolate the one-time items in 4Q. So the Trident -- if I could just get those numbers again, the Trident benefit in 4Q, the new run rate interest expense, and the impact of redeeming the, debt because my sense is that will all flow through adjusted, correct?
Daniel S. Glaser: That's correct. Mike?
J. Michael Bischoff: Okay. Dealing with interest expense, the run rate, I think, for the last couple of quarters is about $40 million. We did just issue debt. The average cost of that debt, though, is 3.3%. And so the calculation, when you look at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis, won't be much of an increase. With regard to the extinguishment of the debt, it's already occurred. We know it's $24 million. That's $0.03. The third part of your question, I think, dealt with investment income, predominantly, the carried interest with regard to Trident III, and we do not do the calculations. That calculation is done by the private equity firm that manages and oversees Trident III. It's a fairly complex calculation that they have to go through every one of the investments that they have because it has to do with regard to the partner interest, and what part of that partner interest no longer can be clawed back. And so I do have some sympathy for them when they're going through the calculation and giving us that information, trying to give it to us on a timely fashion. That's why we say it's very difficult to forecast because it has to do with the harvesting of their profits and how it impacts the specific part of the carried interest that could not be clawed back. So that's a long way of saying, we don't know for sure, but we would put it in the $10 million range for the fourth quarter.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: That's helpful. Thanks, Mike. And then my separate broader question is on the opportunity for Risk and Insurance Services margin expansion. That spread between organic revenue growth and underlying expense growth seems to be widening over the past 8 quarters, and perhaps, you can just give us a bit more perspective on what you're doing on the expense front to keep that low.
J. Michael Bischoff: Sure, sure. And so let's just start by saying that if you look at our expenses in total, our comp and benefit expenses have actually been rising over the last several years. And it's not just salary inflation, which runs about 30% a year for the people who are still at the company, but it's also pension expense, as we've mentioned before, and some other areas of benefits. And so the comp and ben line has been rising. So the real story is the great job that we've been doing on all other expenses. And so from that standpoint, it's everything from premises to T&E, to meetings, and there's literally about 30 categories of expense that we've been pretty focused on and relentless to make sure that everything is on a need-to-have basis, as opposed to a nice-to-have basis. And so a big part of the story, frankly, over the last 4 years that you have seen in the RIS segment and that which you have begun to see in the Consulting segment is the ability during a year to do things which will benefit you in future years and so -- and to wear that within your P&L. And so what you're seeing here is not a 1-year story. It's basically a couple of years that roll forward as a benefit and in with the things that we're doing with respect to comp and ben. Now let me just say, our expectation is for some pretty reasonable growth in margin in the coming couple of years. The way we look at it, though, we actually put margin third on our hit parade. We look at growth in revenues first, both organic and through acquisition, then we look at earnings. And our focus really is driving earnings, and in particular, EPS. And we've said, you stick with us over a 10-year period, we'll give you a CAGR of EPS of 13% or so. We've been delivering on that basis. We're not saying it's every year or every quarter, but we certainly think we will do it over the long term. And the last point is margin, and we seek margin expansion and we'll always have margin expansion if we continue to have expense growth less than revenue growth. Now to be sure, as the margin gets higher and higher in either segment, the ability to deliver margin expansion of significant levels reduces because the air that you would need between expense growth and revenue growth gets wider and wider as the margin goes up. And it would be bad leadership and management if we look at those businesses and said, "Now that the margin is terrific, we want more air. So we want you to be investing less in day-to-day in those businesses." And so we're very open. We don't see it in front of us now, but certainly, over the years, we would expect that if these margins keep improving that at some point in time, we won't be as focused on double-digit operating income growth. We would remain very focused on double-digit EPS growth, but it would shift slightly. But we don't see that in front of us today.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Right. So essentially, you're saying next couple of years, pretty clear go wide path to continued margin improvement and EPS growth and -- I'm sorry, earnings growth in the RIS segment?
Daniel S. Glaser: Correct.
Operator: And we'll go next to Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Two quick questions. One, just back on the exchanges, just quickly, of the new clients that you've got, I guess, 56, I'm just curious, how many of those were actually existing benefits administration clients for Mercer? So what's the actual new business that you're actually getting versus just putting somebody in the exchange?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay, and so here's one thing, Brian. As you recall, if you go back a quarter or 2, we were saying that any time you're in a business where it has some real innovation going forward, the focus is on existing clients, explaining to current clients what the alternatives are. And so I'll hand over to Julio to give you the details. But certainly, our belief was very much that this was going to be in the first iterations existing clients, as opposed to new clients. But Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin: Right. Thanks, Dan. Of H&B clients, of the 34 clients in the active space, one of them is actually new to Mercer. And again, this was expected. As Dan mentioned, we expected to have a lot of discussions with our clients as we were trying to design responses to different changes that were happening in the marketplace, under ACA and others. We have a really solid pipeline, though, I want to say again, for both mid-year enrollments and also 2015. And I also want to make sure it's very clear that on our existing clients, we still see opportunity for expanding because we have a great breadth of additional ancillary and voluntary products that we traditionally have not worked with clients on. So that gives us a potential for opportunity on the upside. And of course, in most cases, we are brokering additional lines of coverage as we expand these relationships and adding new services such as a full plan administration that we may or may not have had in the past. And also we get the opportunity, as I said, for ancillary products which tend to have higher commission in core medical. So there are a lot of opportunity even with our current clients to expand our relationship with them and broaden it even further.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So there is going to be a revenue pickup from putting existing clients in exchanges because of the other services, plus it's just a different revenue model? Is that correct?
Julio A. Portalatin: Yes, I mean, we expect it. Time will tell because we're just launching now, right? So 2014 clients are launching as we speak. They're obviously coming in and looking at what we have to offer, and time will tell in the near future as to how the revenue -- average revenue per client actually behaves.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then one quick one on the reinsurance, if I may. Wonder if you could chat a little bit about the supply of kind of alternative capital right now coming in for one more renewals? And is there still reasonable amount of demand from pension funds and stuff to actually invest in this business, and then what impact do you think it has on 1, 1?
Daniel S. Glaser: Alex?
Alexander S. Moczarski: Clearly, it's the big subject in the reinsurance world, and we also made around $45 billion and growing of interest looking to be deployed, because not that much is -- that amount is deployed. I think the insurance companies are taking a balanced look. They're going to use traditional reinsurance. They're going to use this new capital. The effect on us, clearly, it's a bit of a headwind. But on the other hand, we're seeing that because of the way we have our revenues, either from just a fee structure or capped commission, the effect is being mitigated somewhat. And we're actually doing a lot of cap -- new cap business, so we're doing -- I think our revenues are probably double what they were last year, year-to-date. So it's providing a lot of options to our clients and where there are options there's need for advice, and that's what we're doing. We're making sure we understand the appetite of the suppliers of capital and the appetite or demand of those who need it, and try to match that. So we're kind of excited about this so we recognize that it just makes life more interesting.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got you. How much of your business right now is fees or cap commissions so you're not going to see the impact?
Alexander S. Moczarski: Well, I would rather not give you that indication right now...
Daniel S. Glaser: It's actually a relatively small fee.
J. Michael Bischoff: It's a relatively small amount, given...
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, it's a relatively small fee.
Operator: And we'll go next to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Most of my questions have been answered. I had a question on the exchange. I'm trying to understand, I think, if someone moves to an exchange, I'm guessing part of the reason they do that is to kind of divorce themselves from rising health care costs. Can you talk about why a company would move to an exchange to self-insured? Is it really from a -- just to outsource the management of the benefits or is there another aspect to that decision that I'm missing?
Daniel S. Glaser: Julio, you want to take that question?
Julio A. Portalatin: Yes, there are several reasons why companies considers exchanges. Certainly, to give their employees the opportunity to have a wider range of choice as to how they design their specific benefits in relation to their needs, and that's a big impetus. Second impetus, of course, is, yes, clients are looking for the opportunity to understand how they might be able to structure programs for better cost control as time goes on and time goes into the future. Now that's usually as a result of moving from a defined benefit type of a health offer to defined contribution. But we actually saw many of our clients convert, at least for this time period, and stay under the defined benefit piece, which means that they would continue to be potentially vulnerable to increases in medical inflation. But over time, I'm sure they'll make decisions as to how best to be able to do that, might move to a defined contribution. Thirdly, yes, there are a lot of requirements under the new ACA for administration and considerable cost associated with that. And they want to make sure that they can put themselves in a position where they can rely on someone who already has the experience to do that, and hopefully, more efficiently and more effectively, for them and their employees. And then there are several other reasons as well as each individual circumstance is evaluated, and we design programs to address those needs.
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, one of the benefits in bending the cost curve is not about necessarily clients moving from defined benefit to defined contribution, but it's using the services of Mercer to bend the cost curve through wellness programs and comparison shopping between different medical providers, and so it's a very broad subject. I would just remind everyone that the health benefit is one of the core benefits that people look at when they're deciding which company to give their services and time to, and so companies will have to be relatively cautious because there is a war for talent out there, and it would take a very brave company, and perhaps, even to go very quickly to say, "We want to get out of health care. Because if your competitors don't, then you may be opening yourself up to some talent vulnerability.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And I guess, I mean, on that point, I mean, how do you weigh the decision, Dan, to move or not move to an exchange with your employee base? And I'm guessing you -- to the extent you did, you probably already know which exchange you would go with.
Daniel S. Glaser: I pretty much have that one down, and Julio is sitting right next to me on my right. So I mean, for us, is that -- when we first looked at Mercer Marketplace, the first thing that we said was we want in because it created greater flexibility to individual colleagues to make choices which are relevant to them and their family sizes and a whole slew of other things, and so to me, it was very flexible. What we didn't want to do was crowd-out existing Mercer clients, and put ourselves in front of the queue, so to speak. And so just to be clear, the Marsh & McLennan Companies will be joining Mercer Marketplace at the point in time the Mercer Marketplace says, we'll make the catch without impacting any other clients.
Operator: We'll go next to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Two questions. The first is, on the Consulting business, do you see a natural limit to the margins you've given? That business has gone up because, clearly, you need to be investing in the business as you do. So is there a natural limit to the margin ceiling, if you will? And then secondly just to make sure I got the numbers, when you talked about the number of lives in Mercer Marketplace, I think you said 220,000. Is that in both the active and retiree exchanges?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay, so let me take the first question first. The 220,000 lives are both in the active and the retiree space and count both existing employees and their families. That takes care of that one. In terms of the Consulting segment's margin overall, I would say there's no natural cap to those businesses, but recognize that the Consulting segment is different than RIS. It has lower levels of aggregated recurring revenue streams and so it's more about the mechanics of the business in terms of how the P&L is arrived at. And so, naturally, there's higher levels of acquisition cost because you always have to find the next project, the next account in some parts of the business. Now both Julio and John are working to find ways of making the business stickier with clients and more recurring. But I would doubt that it would ever be at the levels of RIS, where, in insurance, people just say "Hey, I'd buy an insurance policy year-after-year, and it's not as cyclical and I don't really care about what economic conditions are. I might change my deductible or terms and conditions, but I'm buying that policy." It's different on the Consulting side. So while there's no natural cap, I think the idea that there's 2 elements to it: one, the P&L construction is less recurring revenue; and two, on the people side, the Consulting segment, in general, has some of our most highly-educated, world-renowned experts and you pay for those experts. And so from that standpoint, there's a bit of a constraint just on the comp and ben side.
Operator: So we'll take our final question from Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Have a final wrap up here on the healthcare exchange and margin accretion. I guess, Julio, when you talked about the breakdown of sort of the 25% that are still using a self-insured model within the exchange, within the Mercer Marketplace, if I was to think of a current Mercer benefit client that's a self-insured client, a larger, corporate America client, and was going to transition to a Mercer Marketplace exchange on a -- continue on a self-insured basis, is there any margin change in that client? Outside of ancillary, I understand all that different, but just on the core service, is there a margin difference?
Daniel S. Glaser: Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin: It's difficult to discount the impact ancillary and voluntary products will have on that margin and relationship we have with our client. So if you were to take an apples-to-apples client situation, it usually ends up when they go on the actual marketplace, there's a potential, even under self-insured, for that margin to hopefully improve, to be quite honest with you. Because over time, they will continue to sell, like I said, via voluntary and ancillary. We made a conscious decision when we went in, unlike potentially others, that we wanted to have that as a very important platform, a part of the platform. And so it's difficult to distinguish it when we made it as part of our major strategy and part -- a strong part of the platform and value proposition for all of our clients that come onto Mercer Marketplace.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. I think I understand. The other question I have, quickly, is on the brokerage side of the business, on the risk side and the Marsh Agency business. I guess, when I look at the revenue base, and I know recently you said at a presentation that Marsh Agency's got about $450 million of revenue. I guess I would have thought the risk business would have had more growth? And so I guess my question would be is, on the traditional Marsh client, pre-agency, what is the retention both on number of clients and fee basis been on that piece of the business?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. Let me just start by speaking broadly, and then I'll hand it over to Peter. First of all, the RIS segment, we're very happy with the level of growth and the consistency over many quarters. We've grown organically 14 quarters in a row within RIS. And when we look at the overall Marsh business in total, there's been a good mixture of high levels of revenue retention, as well as new business. So we look at that business, and we're pretty comfortable. As Peter was mentioning earlier, and we have an ethos in this shop of not calling out individual small items and trying to make everything an exception, we wear our results. But to give Peter a little bit of a pat, what he was alluding to earlier was that there was a little bit of timing in the U.S. and Canada. And there was one particular program within the agency, which is nonrecurring, which used to be a pretty big program, and a government agency decided not to buy it. And so that has had an impact in a quarter where we don't expect to be a recurring impact, and -- but I'll hand over to Peter and see if he wants to elaborate at all.
Peter Zaffino: Thanks, Dan. That's very thorough, and what I would add is that I want to emphasize, again, that the fundamentals of the core business are strong. New business is strong. Client retention is very strong, and so overall, the performance, looking at it in 1 quarter, you can draw conclusions. But I try to take a look at it over a longer period of time, and I'm very confident that we're going to perform very well. And just a reminder that the 6 different businesses that we report in that segment, so it's U.S./Canada, Marsh & McLennan Agency, we have an MGA, we have a STARS, which is our RMS platform technology business, we have programs, we have private clients. So when you take that all in the mix, they don't all move in the same direction in a particular quarter. So again, Dan had highlighted some of the anomalies. There are a few more, but overall, I can assure you that the fundamentals are quite strong.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Yes, I mean, I wasn't talking about this quarter, and I probably should have said that, per se. It's just sort of, if I look at Marsh, ex-Guy Carpenter, ex-fiduciary, look at Marsh revenue, I've got about $5.5 billion for 2013 and just over $5.2 billion in 2011. And I look over that time period and go, okay, we've got $400 million of agency revenue build-up, and go, I would have thought that $5.2 million plus $400 million plus some organic growth from the traditional business would have had overall Marsh level, just higher, just on a theoretical basis, not like this quarter and anything like that.
Daniel S. Glaser: That's fair enough, and I just want to draw it to a close. But I would, as a reminder, just go back into the notes and have a look at the consumer business, which we pulled out of Marsh, the couple hundred million dollars, and now it's counted within Mercer. And so in those numbers that you were citing, you would have to restate it for that consumer business. Okay. So thanks, Charles, and thank you, everybody. I'm very happy everybody was able to join us on the call this morning. I would also like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in delivering such fine results. So have a good day, everybody.
Operator: And again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Second quarter 2013 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's most recent SEC filings, which are available on the Marsh & McLennan Companies website, for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thanks, Jamie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results, as reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh, Head of Investor Relations. Following my comments, Mike will discuss our financial results in more detail, and then we'll take your questions. Marsh & McLennan Companies produced another quarter of excellent financial results, generating adjusted operating income growth of 13%. This comes on top of 14% growth in the second quarter of last year. Our performance in the quarter represents another step forward in our journey to be an elite company. We continue to successfully execute the 4-pillar strategy we first outlined in 2010, which is designed to create sustainable shareholder value. As a global growth company, the first pillar of our strategy is to grow revenue and earnings. Despite challenging macro conditions, we have consistently delivered underlying revenue growth and produced adjusted EPS growth of 13% in 2011, 16% last year and 17% year-to-date. Over the last few years, we have been relentlessly pursuing efficiency gains, which have funded investments in new technologies, improved data and analytics and client capabilities. Significantly improved operating performance also has allowed us to increase salaries and performance-based compensation. For example, in Risk and Insurance Services, variable compensation has almost doubled in the last 5 years. This includes productivity gains, evidenced by the fact that headcount has increased modestly in RIS, while revenue growth has approached $1 billion over the last 5 years. In addition to the consistency and strength of our earnings, we expect to see continued growth in cash flows. An increasing portion of our cash flow will be available for dividends, acquisitions and share repurchase. We believe a balanced approach to deployment of capital will contribute to long-term earnings growth and maximize total return to shareholders. Looking at our second quarter results in more detail. Underlying revenue growth again exceeded growth in underlying operating expenses, as it has for 20 of the past 21 quarters. In the second quarter, this revenue growth, combined with operating leverage, produced 13% growth in adjusted operating income. And our consolidated margin increased 190 basis points, 19.2%, the highest second quarter margin in 9 years. Importantly, both Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting delivered double-digit growth in adjusted operating income, as well as excellent margin improvement. Risk and Insurance Services produced another excellent quarter. Underlying revenue increased 3% at Marsh and 5% at Guy Carpenter. Adjusted operating income for this segment rose 10%, with the margin expanding to 25.6%, an increase of 170 basis points. This is the segment's highest second quarter margin since 2004. At Marsh, revenue was $1.4 billion, with all major geographic regions contributing to 3% underlying revenue growth, a solid performance considering it follows a 6% increase in last year's second quarter. New business was $273 million in the quarter. The International division expanded 3%, led by 10% growth in Latin America. This is the fourth consecutive year of double-digit underlying revenue growth in Latin America in the second quarter. We continue to expand our International operations. In the second quarter, Marsh acquired the leading insurance brokers in Peru and the Dominican Republic. Asia-Pacific and EMEA also contributed to Marsh's underlying revenue growth in the quarter. In the U.S./Canada division, 2% underlying growth was the same as the first quarter. This is on top of 5% growth in the first half of last year. Guy Carpenter also had strong performance, led by its U.S. and international operations. This continues the long-term trend of underlying revenue growth, now at 18 consecutive quarters. Revenue was $285 million in the second quarter, up 5% on an underlying basis. This is even more impressive considering the 10% growth in last year's second quarter, higher risk retentions by clients and softening pricing conditions. Guy Carpenter's revenue growth reflects both high revenue retention rates as well as new business development. Double-digit revenue gains were achieved in Continental Europe and the U.K., consistent with Carpenter's goal of increasing its share outside the U.S. Double-digit increases were also achieved at Carpenter's U.S. and U.K. facultative practices and its marine global specialty practice. The Consulting segment also produced strong results. In the second quarter, revenue was $1.4 billion, reflecting a rise of 2% on an underlying basis, including growth of 4% at Mercer and a revenue decline at Oliver Wyman. Adjusted underlying expenses were flat, which produced adjusted operating income of $205 million, an increase of 10%. As a result, the segment's margin expanded 120 basis points to 14.6%, which is Consulting's highest second quarter margin since 2004. At Oliver Wyman, underlying revenue in the second quarter decreased 4% to $366 million, an improvement from the first quarter. Oliver Wyman continued to protect its profitability despite the revenue decline. For the balance of the year, we expect to see continued sequential revenue improvement. Mercer posted strong revenue of $1 billion, an increase of 4% on an underlying basis. Growth was achieved across all geographic regions. Health and investments continue to lead the way, with growth of 6% and 9%, respectively. Retirement saw an increase in project work, resulting in 2% growth. The development of Mercer Marketplace, the private U.S. health insurance exchange launched in January, continues. In July, Mercer announced an initial group of 5 employers that will offer 2014 benefits through Mercer Marketplace. Since making this announcement 3 weeks ago, Mercer has added additional clients to the platform. Whether looking at revenue, margin or earnings, Mercer had an excellent quarter and first 6 months of the year. So in summary, MMC's overall performance in the second quarter and first half of the year was exceptional. These results show that our companies' strong earnings growth continues. With that, let me turn it over to Mike.
J. Michael Bischoff: Well, thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. It's nice to report another strong quarter. Revenue in the quarter was $3.1 billion, an increase of 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income rose 13% to $591 million and the consolidated margin increased 190 basis points to 19.2%. GAAP EPS rose 17% to $0.69, and adjusted EPS grew 18% to $0.72. And this is on top of a strong second quarter last year, when adjusted EPS rose 22%. For the first 6 months of this year, revenue was $6.2 billion, an increase of 2% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income rose 14% to $1.2 billion, and the consolidated margin increased 200 basis points to 19.4%. GAAP EPS for the first half of the year rose 18% to $1.44, and adjusted EPS grew 17% to $1.45. Investment income in the second quarter was $23 million compared with $4 million a year ago. As I discussed on last quarter's call, we retained carried interest in Trident III, a private equity fund MMC created in 2003. In 2006, we contributed our limited partner interest at $200 million to our U.K. pension plan but retained our share of the general partner interest. Recognition of carried interest is deferred until it is no longer subject to clawback. This quarter is the first time the carried interest from Trident III has been recognized, totaling $21 million, which added $0.02 to EPS. In the third quarter, we anticipate $5 million in investment income, primarily related to Trident III. Interest expense in the quarter decreased from $45 million last year to $40 million in this quarter. Our next debt maturity of $320 million is in July of next year. Both S&P and Moody's recently upgraded their outlook on MMC, reflecting our strengthening financial position. Corporate expense declined to $46 million in the quarter from $45 million last year on an adjusted basis. In May, the board authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program and increased the quarterly dividend by 9%, from $0.23 to $0.25 per share, effective in the third quarter. Our cash utilization in the second quarter included $150 million to repurchase 3.7 million shares of stock, $128 million for dividends and $100 million for acquisitions. In the first half of this year, we have bought back 6.4 million shares for $250 million. We remain committed to meaningful share repurchase. With that, I am happy to turn it back to Dan.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Mike. And operator, we're ready to turn to the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wanted to ask about the U.S. growth, the organic there. What are the trends you're seeing in the U.S. risk business at this point in time, maybe from a units and pricing perspective? And how do you think that the organic there will look going forward from here?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. I mean, first, I would just say that, from an overall basis, if you look at how Marsh has performed over the last several quarters, they've generally been in an area of somewhere like 4%, 5% and 3% growth, so call it 3% to 5% growth organic. And Guy Carpenter has pretty much been a 5%, 6% and a 5%, so call it more around a 5% growth over the last several quarters. Why don't I turn to both Peter and Alex to give you some specific commentary as to how they see the P&C environment in both retail and reinsurance? So, Peter?
Peter Zaffino: Thanks, Dan. Mentioning pricing, let me talk about overall margin, and specifically, I'll highlight the U.S. Overall, we saw a bit of slowdown when we compare the prior quarter in 2012, about 40 basis points. U.S. was the only major region that we saw increases in pricing, albeit modest. So when I compare year-over-year, the casualty lines, more of our clients saw rate increases than the prior year, but the average was a little bit less. And the one segment that did not see as much in terms of price increasing was the property. So I feel that it's a very stable environment. There's a couple of peaks that are being, as I said, mentioned in public D&O, workers' compensation, some excess umbrella, but generally speaking, it's modest increases for us in terms of pricing.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thanks, Peter. Alex?
Alexander S. Moczarski: Yes, so we were pleased with the growth in the U.S. Clearly, there's no tailwinds coming from rates, so it's really about just doing things better. It's about higher retentions. We've had good new -- solid new business. Our blend of broking, analytics and strategic advisory is working well. So, no help from the rates but just doing things better, concentrating on what we need to do to keep our clients. And essentially, that's it.
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, so in summary, I would say you look at the U.S., and on the reinsurance side, there'd be more downward pressure on rates, so more softening activity on reinsurance. On the retail side, it's more flattish, but relative to the rest of the world, a bit better than the rest of the world in the U.S. We've been at this game a long time, and in years past, when you see softening in reinsurance, unless you have loss activity, it's pretty hard to prevent that from shifting into primary 6 months, 12 months, 18 months down the road.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Okay, great. Very thorough. One other one is just on capital deployment. Good to see the buybacks and the higher dividend. If I was to step back, though, and go back to the 2010 Investor Day, when you sort of laid out the game plan for the corporation, you guys have actually beat your guidance and beat your numbers since then. The only component to that, that I think is behind this maybe I feel that, back then, you mentioned that capital deployment were contributing 300 basis points to the plan. I'm sort of wondering, has capital -- where do you think capital deployment will be from here? It seems like it's picking up. So can you sort of compare what you were thinking back in 2010 to where you're at today? There's a lot of optionality there.
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. Sure. I would say when you look at capital deployment, to begin with, our feeling is that we have rising free cash flow. So number one, that's a good-news story. And then when we look at how we would deploy that cash, we would probably look at dividends first. And we would look from here to keep our payout ratios in a similar area to where they are today. So you'd likely see us improving our dividend as we improve our earnings. Then we look at acquisitions, and we don't budget for acquisitions. We look at a lot of things and, ultimately, that's a variable. And share repurchase, we're committed to share repurchase. And if you look at the last 5 quarters, we've had 5 quarters in a row of share repurchase. So I think as you go forward, you'll see us both looking at a balanced basis in terms of deployment, dividend, acquisitions and share repurchase. But, Mike, do you want to add some color to that?
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes, thank you, Dan. And Greg, you're absolutely spot on looking at us historically. Not only have we been reinvesting in our business, but we've really been paying down our debt and, essentially, deleveraging our balance sheet. In addition to that, we had pension obligations that we've put quite a bit of our cash flow into pension obligations. So that's historic. If you look going forward, we do not plan to delever our balance sheet actively. We think the natural earnings that you're seeing, not just this quarter but the past few years, will naturally deleverage our balance sheet. So we don't have to do any more debt pay-down, and we feel that the bulk of our contributions to our global pension plans are behind us. So, as Dan said, we look at the deployment of our capital on a balanced fashion going forward, and we feel very good about it.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you could update us on your efforts in the health exchange. I know you had some announcements on that. And maybe talk a little bit more detail about what's going on there, and then also how we should think about maybe revenue and earnings impact as we head through the rest of the year.
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure, and your question, Dan, on revenue and earnings impact, is that specific to the health exchange or throughout the whole company?
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Yes, how to think about how that will play through the rest of the year.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay, terrific. So, Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin: Thank you, Dan -- both Dans. I appreciate it. I want to put some light on what we consider to be a pretty good milestone for us in the quarter as it relates to Mercer Marketplace. You saw the press release came out announcing that we had 5 companies -- employers now already signed up to Mercer Marketplace. Since then, we've signed an additional 9 employers, and there are a significant amount of potential opportunities for both 2014 and 2015 still pending. Those 9 employers represent about 35,000 lives. And why we think it's such a milestone is because it really validates several key things about Mercer Marketplace. One is that it's very attractive to a lot of additional across-the-board industries and employers from as little as a couple of hundred employees to several thousand. And that's been something that we've seen as a distinction based on our offer, and it's beginning to hold true. While we've always been kind of cautious about what 2014 was going to give us, and we still are, we certainly are seeing a lot of activity. So it demonstrates that we have a very viable option for our clients. In addition to that, we continue to see activity, we continue to see more interest, and we'll see how that builds for '14 and '15. As far as revenue is concerned, as we have stated in the past, there'll be no material revenue recognized in 2013. This is for enrollment for those that are effective on January 1, 2014, and beyond. And then, of course, through '15, we'll see how that develops. And thus, the earnings will be the same, will be no significant impact on earnings in 2013. Now in the early years, as you can think about this, we, of course, will continue to invest. And I believe we'll see that, as this thing pans out, the earnings will be similar to the type of business that we have that's not in the Mercer Marketplace. So it'll be very consistent.
Daniel S. Glaser: So, Julio, just to confirm, you've got 9 companies signed up now?
Julio A. Portalatin: Nine companies signed up for about 35,000 lives.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Thank you.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Just a follow-up, there is some expense flowing through now that's already being absorbed within your margins, correct?
Julio A. Portalatin: That is correct. I mean, we are taking all expense right to the operating results for the Mercer Marketplace.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. One other quick question. The revenues had some modest FX headwind. Was there any meaningful or any FX impact to earnings in the quarter?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. So just one thing in terms of the expenses that we're rolling through on the health exchange, one of the ways you have to look at that is, with regard to health, there may be some downward margin pressure on -- specifically around the health exchange because of the investments. However, we're selling more product, and so there are -- typically, companies are now buying up additional product like voluntary products through Mercer Marketplace. And so it looks pretty much the same to us from a margin perspective. So, Mike, do you want to take the question on FX?
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes, Dan, you're absolutely right. Not only in this quarter but in almost every quarter over the last 6 quarters, foreign exchange has worked against us from the standpoint of profitability because of the strengthening of the dollar against most of our -- not all, but most of our major currencies, but it's been something that we've been able to absorb in every quarter, including this one.
Operator: And we'll go next to Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: I want to start with a question for Alex. As we start to see -- or not start to see -- as we see significant downward pressure on property cap reinsurance rates, does it move the needle at all in terms of clients no longer retaining more and maybe taking advantage of some of the reinsurance arbitrage opportunities?
Daniel S. Glaser: So, Alex, do you want to take that?
Alexander S. Moczarski: Yes, actually, we have seen the -- if your -- if the cost of your own capital is more expensive than the contingent capital out there, companies are buying more reinsurance. So it really depends on the company. There are companies, obviously, that have strong balance sheets, and their relative cost of capital for their different tranches makes it -- makes more sense to retain more. And there are others that are taking advantage of the cheap capacity that's available.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay. So in the aggregate, not a dramatic change?
Alexander S. Moczarski: We are -- to date, no. But we're obviously looking at it. And what's great for us is that we can provide advice to our clients because now there's so many alternatives that they face, and we look at their programs in a holistic manner. So actually, we're quite excited about what's going on.
Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay, fantastic. And for Mike, is there a good run rate for the number of shares that Marsh expects to issue this year, for computation and other purposes?
Daniel S. Glaser: Mike?
J. Michael Bischoff: Thank you. That's a very good question. And as you know, for a number of years, we've had essentially performance-based awards tied to the overall growth of the operating income. And so there we, every period, look and see whether there should be some additional accruals in that. So it's hard to basically give you a calibration of the run rate because it's tied to our performance. One of the things that I would say, though, is for our goal, over not just this year but many years, is to try to offset the potential dilution of any and all awards, including stock options, and that's one of the reasons why we've been doing meaningful share repurchase. In fact, over the last 5 quarters, I think we did about $480 million, so approaching almost $0.5 billion in share repurchase. But to your specific question, it's really hard to tell because it varies quarter-to-quarter.
Operator: And we'll go next to Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: A couple questions here. First, I was hoping you could talk about what the pipeline looks like right now with Oliver Wyman, particularly with respect to continental Europe?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay.
John P. Drzik: Sure. All of one's business, as you know, is affected by macroeconomic conditions, and conditions are still relatively weak in our major markets, including Europe. Looking ahead, our recent sales and current pipeline have been strengthening to some extent. So, as Dan said, based on what we're seeing, we expect sequential improvement in revenue growth rate over the next couple of quarters, and that will come more from North America than Europe, but I think we're seeing improvement in both.
Daniel S. Glaser: And, Brian, just the way we look at it on an overall management team basis, Oliver Wyman, in many quarters and in many years actually, ends up outgrowing all the other OpCos. This year is obviously a tough year. And so from that standpoint, it's not going to be a big provider of revenue growth for us, so the direction of John and his team are to protect earnings. And they've been doing a really good job of making sure that the revenue shortfalls is not really an earnings event for us.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Absolutely. Great. And then next question, I guess, is for both Dan and Mike. When I look at your capital management and I look at your debt-to-capital ratios and I look at your debt-to-EBITDA, you're sitting here near historical lows. I guess my question is, is there a need to continue to let leverage decline? Why can't you take advantage of some of the low interest rates right now and actually lever up a little bit to buy back some stock at attractive levels?
Daniel S. Glaser: And so I'll take that and then hand over to the expert in Mike. But ultimately, the way I would first look at this is this is what we would call a high-class problem. And so from that standpoint, we're a conservative company, and we're looking to make sure -- I mean, when I look at things personally, it would be hard for me to think that we should lever up, specifically, to buy back stock. We could certainly lever up to make acquisitions if they became available to us or -- but I do think with enough of our increasing cash flow, we will have meaningful share repurchase in future quarters and in future years. And so the notion of levering up, even though it may have a slight appeal at this moment in time, just strikes us as not being in the philosophy of this conservative firm. But, Mike, do you want to add to that?
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes, I think it's well said, Dan. Starting from this premise that you look at your entire capital structure and, Brian, you also look at your cash on hand, and you look at where it is and how you can deploy that. And so before we're thinking of going to the capital markets, we want to make sure that we're effectively using our capital. And I know you follow us closely so that you're aware that over the last year we were very effective in not only utilizing our international cash but bringing it back into the U.S. And so we could do, along the lines of what you're saying, repurchase our stock. We did 100 million in the first -- $100 million in the first quarter of this year, the first time in many, many years that we repurchased in the first quarter. So that was really utilizing our own cash on a global basis. The second thing then we look at, and as Dan and I have talked about on this call, is that we take a balanced approach. We want to put our capital deployment to dividends, acquisitions and share repurchase. So really, reinvesting back into the business, either direct capital investments or acquisitions, is a primary goal, but conversely, returning capital to the shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase is very important, so it's a blend. And then the last thing, as Dan said, we have a journey to elite. And when we've looked at companies around the world that are generally viewed as elite companies, their credit metrics typically have an A in it. So it's important to us. The last thing that would do is it gives us a cushion with regard to any future negative consequences that we may see in the macro environment or, as Dan said, opportunities that we may see going forward. So we think that the balanced approach is really a good guideline for analysts and investors.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Can you elaborate a bit on the reinsurance side in terms of capital markets activity that you're seeing participating in and whether or not that's been a contributor or you saw that in 2Q results and whether or not you expect that to be a bigger piece of the pie going forward?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay, sure. Alex?
Alexander S. Moczarski: So we reckon there's about $45 billion of convergent capital in the market. Not all of it is being deployed or can't find a place to be deployed. But clearly, there was an effect on the Florida renewals. It's essentially, as you know, focused on cat. Yes, I -- the question is -- some of it is pension money, some of it is private equity money. The pension money tends to stay for a long time, so we'll see what the effect will be on that. But we've had good activity on the cat bond side. I think there's been about $4.2 billion issued, more or less, and we've been involved in about $2.2 billion. So we're geared for that activity as well.
Daniel S. Glaser: And if you look at it, Mike, we're an intermediary, and so we can -- we're always looking at ways of creating value for clients. When we look for our clients having many sources of capital, both traditional and alternative, is a good thing. And our clients need advice. They would need somebody to evaluate the alternative forms and negotiate terms and conditions, et cetera. We've had some interesting work between Guy Carpenter and Marsh of late, which gives an example of the type of thing that could happen, where there may be some pressure in certain areas of Guy Carpenter on the cat side, but then there could be opportunities between Guy Carpenter and Marsh on the retail side. So, Peter, do you want to talk a little bit about the recent MTA transaction?
Peter Zaffino: Sure. Thanks, Dan. We're very excited. We did our first cat bond for one of our clients. As Dan mentioned the MTA, so it's a $200 million cat bond, and it's a real strong example of when we can bring the power of MMC together by using 2 operating companies to deliver a solution for our clients. We're actually starting to develop a pipeline. It tends to be very industry-specific. Don't think it'll replace any traditional capital that's being deployed for our clients, but it's very complementary and one that we expect to see more demand over time.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mike Zaremski with Crédit Suisse.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: A quick follow-up on free cash flow expectations and the earlier comment about the pension contribution falling. Could you put some figures around how much lower the pension contribution run rate could fall, especially given the interest rates and equity markets have been moving north?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure, Mike. Mike, do you want to take that?
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes, the one thing, Mike, that we've learned many, many years is because the remeasurement of our pension obligations occurs at the end of the year. And where interest rates are at the end of the year, even though things look favorable today, we have to wait till the end of the year. But that said, let me give you a little bit more color with regard to the pension obligations that we've been dealing with. Over the last 2 years, our committed funding levels in 2012 and 2013 were in the neighborhood of $320 million. In 2012, on top of that $320 million, we put $100 million of discretionary contribution into our U.K. plan. It was using our excess capital. We were able to do it on a tax-efficient basis. And obviously, it helped the funding ratios in the U.K. As we went into this year, on top of roughly the $320 million of obligations that we had, we thought that it was very prudent to basically do prefunding in the U.K. of about $250 million, once again, tax-efficient basis, utilizing our international cash, and about $70 million into our Canadian plans. As a result of that, we're anticipating that total funding for this year will be in the neighborhood of $650 million. So having said that the U.K. funding, that the $250 million included prefunding, it was prefunding of some of our obligations in the U.K. that would affect 2014, '15 and, perhaps, '16. And so we think that, based upon all of that, there will be a market decrease with regard to the levels or our pension obligations and the funding going forward in '14, '15 and, most likely, beyond.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. That's great color. The last question is in regards to the business climate in Europe. Some economists are cautiously optimistic, saying GDP has troughed. What is Marsh seeing on that front?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Why don't we do 2 things. Well, I'll address it overall, and then if we just kind of quickly go around the horn and have each of our operating companies give you a little bit of color of how they're viewing things in Europe these days. We've read some of the same material and, of course, oftentimes, the insurance, specifically, might be a lagging indicator and consulting may be a forward indicator in terms of activity. So we often look to OW as sort of our canary in the coal mine to try to get a view as to what's business sentiment like and whether discretionary spending is picking up. Bearing in mind, in terms of insurance, contracts tend to be annual, and Europe, at least in certain countries, is weighted toward January 1, so you don't see really any pickup until the following January 1 period. But why don't we go around the horn, starting with John Drzik of Oliver Wyman?
John P. Drzik: So as I said earlier, I think the conditions for us are showing a slight uptick, so we're seeing a little bit of improvement. So -- but I'd say, on the whole, conditions are still relatively weak. Our clients are still relatively cautious in terms of their discretionary spending, and so we're not seeing a major change. But I would say the directional indicators we see in our pipeline and from our business leadership that things are modestly improving in Europe.
Daniel S. Glaser: Peter?
Peter Zaffino: Yes, so as Dan said, sometimes we're a trailing indicator. I wouldn't read into our quarter in terms of underlying growth in EMEA as one that would look similar in the future, meaning that we had really challenging comparables in the prior years. We had very strong growth in both the U.K. and Continental Europe. We have a really strong pipeline of new business. We had good new business growth in the quarter. There's some modest economic headwinds that are combined with pricing, so we see a little bit of headwind in the exposure in pricing but nothing that I would be concerned about trending forward. And there's always timing in the quarter. So overall, we're cautiously optimistic and expect to see continued organic growth.
Daniel S. Glaser: Alex?
Alexander S. Moczarski: So, reinsurance isn't -- whether reinsurance, is that correlated with economic conditions? If you've seen over the last 3 years, we've grown at a nice lick there, so it's more really about capacity and about losses. So we continue to look for growth.
Daniel S. Glaser: Julio, your view about Europe?
Julio A. Portalatin: Yes, I mean, our year-to-date growth in Europe continues to be positive. We certainly can't control the external environment, but we're trying hard to make sure that pipeline and opportunities that present themselves, we are very prepared and very well positioned to take advantage of it. So given some -- we've had some situations or some restructuring taking place there for some of our clients, and we certainly are well positioned for that. And our product side, services and some of our survey business continues to be in high demand in that part of the world. So we think that the top line, while a little bit softer than prior years, continues to be positive and is tracking pretty well.
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, and just to add a little bit of overall flavor, Mike, in sort of tying together the comment that I had made earlier, I think in response to Brian's question about whether we should lever up and buy back shares, and my comment that we're a conservative company and that we would always look at making sure that we have enough powder dry for acquisitions if opportunities presented themselves. The way we look at the world is we're pretty much in an age of uncertainty. And I don't think anybody with their hand on heart can really give you a clear prognosis about macro conditions in Europe, what could conceivably happen in China, what could conceivably happen in the Middle East. I mean, there's a lot of flux. And being a conservative company and having the capability to be able to act quickly if certain opportunities presented themselves. So the way we look at it is if the world recovers, we're in great shape. If the world doesn't and actually turns downward, we're in good shape too. So that's our view on that.
Operator: And we'll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I was hoping to drill down a bit on Guy Carpenter. The 5% organic revenue growth despite the impact of downward pressure on reinsurance pricing. I was hoping you can deconstruct that a bit and, essentially, how much of that is driven outside of increased issuance in alternative facilities.
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. So, Alex, how much is traditional growth and how much are you being supplemented by all this alternative capacity?
Alexander S. Moczarski: I think traditional growth would be about 98% of what we -- of the reason. The fact is that Carpenter has been investing well. We are -- I think we're the employer of choice. Good people have been joining us. Our accounts, our large accounts are pristine prestige accounts, and they've been growing too, and we've been growing with them. We have a good blend of broking and strategic advisory and analytics. And it's really about value. And it's also about making sure that you see a client on a regular basis, you do all the blocking and tackling and retention is high and new business is good.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. For Mike, on the Trident III that benefited from the additional investment income, is there any way to think about how much more could flow through in future quarters, so we can calibrate models?
Daniel S. Glaser: So, Mike?
J. Michael Bischoff: Jay, that's a very good question. And as you know, on investment income, we really try to help analysts look to what the next quarter may be. And that's why we gave you an indication of about $5 million, including Trident III, because we know it's very difficult, certainly, when Trident II was liquidating over a 3- or 4-year period. So the question that you have specifically gets to Trident III, and as we said, this is the first quarter that we've actually booked carried interest because it's really the first time period that Trident III has started to liquidate its position. But I think its portfolio, which I have not tracked as closely as Trident II, but I think the portfolio is well over $1 billion. And so as Trident III gets liquidated, which could occur over 3 or 4 years, we do not control it, we do not manage it, and so we'll just have to see how it comes through. Now there's an additional hurdle with regard to the carried interest because the way that we book it for accounting, it has to be to a point where there is no clawback capability, which means that if the rest of the portfolio went to 0, we would still be entitled to what we booked through our income. So sorry I can't give you more specifics other than it could go a number of years as we work our way through it. But it's a nice story, and it will be additional cash to us and additional earnings. But obviously, it's investment income, it's not operating, and that's why we try to isolate it.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: That's helpful. And then finally for Dan, can you tell us a bit more about your appetite for bolt-on acquisitions, both in RIS and Consulting, since there seems to be a continued interest level in that area?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, and I would say very strong. I mean, we've done a series of acquisitions. I mean, if you look in total over the last 5.5 or 6 years, we've done about 60 acquisitions. Most of them have been in RIS, and clearly, MMA has been a core strategy to that. When we look at acquisitions, we look at a lot of factors. The first factor is, generally, does it make us better? Does it give us something that we don't have? Does it expand a capability, a segment, a geography? And then what's the management team like, and are they committed to working not only over the long term, but also working at a bigger organization like us? And we feel that there's an awful lot of companies out there that, when they look at the world today and the macro uncertainty and the higher degrees of regulation and risk in compliance activities and just the sheer level of items that management teams have to deal with, many of these smaller companies come to the realization that they're spending too much time on running this business and not enough time on chasing new accounts and servicing existing accounts. And so we become a very good alternative. Now I can tell you around the world, we don't jump opportunistically at every thing that presents itself because our own feeling is this is more like a courtship that generally takes several years to develop to make sure that there's an affinity between the acquirer and the company being acquired. And so we have a pretty rich pipeline, but no schedule in order to execute that pipeline. There are certain acquisitions that we have done that, literally, we have cultivated for years. Okay?
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes, we understand there's a big pipeline there.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Thomas Mitchell with Miller Tabak.
Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: I'm sure that you've done a very good job on handling expenses overall in the -- on the Consulting side. I'm just wondering, in a sense, in terms of year-over-year comparisons, can we continue to expect to see expenses decline while revenues are up a little bit going forward?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, no, Tom, it's a great question. So let me just take it first by saying our goal is to achieve double-digit earnings growth in most years over the long term. And we fully understand in order to achieve a goal like that, we need to continuously improve performance and continuously invest in our business, our technologies, our -- and our colleagues. And so I want to assure you that even though you're seeing flat expenses now, we are spending money. We're spending money on colleagues, we're spending money on investing for future growth, and we are harvesting operational improvements that we have developed over the last several years and that we are continuing to develop. So I would say that a lot's going on under the hood, and that the fact is we're benefiting on some roll-forward of prior actions and efficiency gains, but we don't -- the cupboard's not bare. We're still achieving additional efficiency gains, so we definitely feel that we'll be able to manage expenses. Whether we manage them at a flat or we manage them at low single digits, we'll still be containing our expenses for the foreseeable future.
Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: That's a good answer. And on a more very mundane basis, the accounting item -- adjustments to acquisition-related accounts, contingent consideration related to acquisitions, just reading that, it sounds to me like if you made a good acquisition, that's a number that would grow in the future. Do I have that right or wrong?
Daniel S. Glaser: No, basically, this is related to the earnouts on acquisitions. Many of the acquisitions that we do have an earnout component. When a firm that we acquire underperforms our expectations of what we have within the earnout, then you would see a negative on that line. And when a -- one of our acquired companies actually outperforms the earnout calculation, then we'll put additional money against the contingent consideration. Mike, do you have anything?
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes, Tom, I would just say it's also a mechanism that we use to bridge the future -- perhaps, the differences between the future outlooks of the sellers and ourselves, and whereas sellers may be absolutely more optimistic and rosy about the outlook, and we're more conservative. And so instead of giving the consideration upfront, we basically have an agreement to say that if the optimism manifests itself, we'll all be happy. So essentially, the way we would view it, we paid a little bit more for an acquisition, but the results were much better than we thought. Conversely, it's a protection for our shareholders if the results, as Dan said, don't perform based upon the expectations of the seller. The nice thing is, I think, over the last 5 years, where we've done about, what, $1.5 billion, $1.7 billion of acquisitions value in total, the actual contingent consideration has been very modest.
Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: And so going forward, though, I'm just assuming that if you continue to make acquisitions every year then -- and you're conservative in your assumptions, you will, in fact, have an item like this, more or less, continuously?
J. Michael Bischoff: Tom, you're absolutely right. I mean, that account changes every quarter. We have additions, we have payments made out, we have revaluation impact. At the end of the quarter, it was in the neighborhood of $80 million. But it will be continuous with regard to how we do the structure of the deal. As a result of that, we view it just as purchase or acquisition accounting, which is why we do not include it in our adjusted earnings and why we exclude it.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to go ahead and turn the call back to you, Mr. Glaser, for any additional or closing remarks.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay, perfect. Thank you, Jamie. I want to thank all of you for joining us on the call this morning. I mean, this call is naturally oriented toward shareholders, but I also want to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to our 54,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication in delivering such fine results and to our tens of thousands of clients for their belief in Marsh & McLennan Companies. So thank you very much.
Operator: And again, that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Please have a great day.

Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. First quarter 2013 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results which are forward-looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's most recent SEC filings, which are available on the Marsh & McLennan Companies' website for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Daniel S. Glaser: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results as reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh, Head of Investor Relations. Following my comments, Mike will discuss our financial results in more detail, and then we'll take your questions. We had an excellent first quarter, which represents another step forward in our journey to be among the elite companies of the world. We are successfully executing the 4 pillar strategy that has served us well. It calls for us to produce long-term growth in revenue and earnings, maintain low capital requirements, generate high levels of cash and manage the risk profile of the company. We remain committed to building on this foundation as we pursue new ways to grow, invest and realize the full potential of our businesses. Marsh & McLennan's strong first quarter results demonstrate that we are performing well. In the first quarter, growth in underlying revenue exceeded growth in underlying operating expenses, as it has for 19 of the past 20 quarters. In the quarter, this operating leverage produced 16% growth in adjusted operating income and our consolidated margin increased 230 basis points to 19.7%. Importantly, both operating segments delivered mid-teens growth in adjusted operating income, as well as substantial margin improvement. Adjusted underlying expense growth was flat in the first quarter. However, as we progress through the year, we expect to see modest expense growth, thus tempering margin expansion for the remainder of the year. Risk and Insurance Services produced another outstanding quarter. Underlying revenue growth at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter was 4%. Adjusted operating income for this segment rose 14%, with margins expanding to 26.6%, an increase of 210 basis points. This is the segment's highest quarterly margin since 2004, an impressive performance when you consider the headwinds we are facing, such as lower fiduciary income, higher pension expense and a challenging economic environment in most developed countries. At Marsh, revenue was $1.4 billion, with all major geographies contributing to Marsh's 4% underlying revenue growth. We are pleased with this performance since it comes on the heels of a very strong growth in last year's first quarter. The International division grew 5%, with Latin America up 13%, Asia-Pacific increasing 6%, and EMEA growing 3%. The U.S./Canada division increased 2%, a solid performance, given the strong growth of 6% last year. Marsh continued to generate high levels of new business, with $256 million this quarter. Guy Carpenter continued to produce impressive results, with revenue of $375 million in the first quarter or growth of 4% on an underlying basis. We are especially pleased with this performance considering the 7% growth in last year's first quarter, higher risk retentions by clients and softening pricing conditions. Guy Carpenter's revenue growth reflects both higher revenue retention, as well as strong new business development. Consistent with Carpenter's goal of broadening its geographic footprint, double-digit revenue growth was achieved in Continental Europe and Latin America, with solid gains in Global Specialties. This excellent performance now extends the trend of Guy Carpenter's quarterly underlying revenue growth into the fifth consecutive year. In our Consulting segment, we continue to focus on higher levels of profitability. In the first quarter, revenue was $1.4 billion, flat on an underlying basis, as growth at Mercer was offset by revenue declines at Oliver Wyman. Importantly, the Consulting segment produced significant earnings growth of 15% to $189 million, as adjusted underlying expenses decreased 2%. As a result, the segment's margin expanded 190 basis points to 13.9%, driven primarily by Mercer. At Oliver Wyman, underlying revenue in the first quarter decreased 9%, as declines in North America and Europe more than offset expansion in Latin America and Asia Pacific. In this difficult macroeconomic environment, John and his management team have taken steps to protect Oliver Wyman's profitability. Mercer's revenue was $1 billion, an increase of 3% on both a reported and underlying basis. On a geographic basis, Mercer grew revenue across each of its major regions. Among its lines of business, strong revenue growth was achieved by Health and Investments. These excellent results in the first quarter reflect the series of actions taken by Mercer's management to reposition the business to grow earnings. In closing, we are very pleased with our overall performance in the first quarter. With that, let me turn it over to Mike.
J. Michael Bischoff: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, revenue was $3.1 billion, an increase of 2% on both the reported and underlying basis. Adjusted operating income rose 16% to $615 million, our highest level of quarterly profitability in almost a decade. And the consolidated margin increased 230 basis points to 19.7%, again, our highest level since 2004. GAAP EPS rose 17% to $0.74, and adjusted EPS grew 16% to $0.73. As we discussed last quarter, to assist in building broader client relationships, Mercer has aligned its Benefit Administration services, formerly described as Outsourcing, within its principle business lines, thus positioning Mercer's capabilities around Health, Retirement, Talent and Investments. Also in the first quarter, a significant portion of Marsh's U.S. Consumer business was transferred to Mercer. Last year, this business had $231 million of revenue, operating income of $40 million and close to 1,000 colleagues. Realigning these 2 businesses within Mercer enables us to concentrate our efforts and expertise in a rapidly shifting landscape, including the convergence between traditional benefits and voluntary benefits. Mercer also used the consumer call center operation to support Mercer Marketplace, its healthcare exchange. The supplemental schedules in our press release provide quarterly revenue, operating income and margins for the past 3 years, reflecting the Consumer and Outsourcing reclassifications. MMC is delivering excellent operating and financial results while continuing to invest for the future. As an indication of this, our capital expenditures have grown substantially in recent years, from approximately $270 million in 2010 to $320 million last year. And CapEx is expected to be approximately $350 million this year, including over $120 million in the first quarter. We're constantly investing in each of our businesses. Throughout the company, we have been creating new products and tools to enhance client service, replacing legacy systems with next-generation technology, improving efficiencies and developing new operating platforms that increase our global capabilities. Investment also includes recruiting and retaining the best talent in our industries. We believe the investments we are making will continue to create significant shareholder value. Investment income in the first quarter was $21 million due to the winding up of Trident II, which accounted for the vast majority of our investments in private equity. We expect only minimal income from our Investment portfolio over the remainder of this year. However, while we no longer have an investment in Trident III, we have retained performance fees related to the creation of this fund in 2003. Recognition of these deferred fees will only occur as investments are harvested and the performance fees are no longer subject to callback. Timing of this is unknown and is not controlled by MMC. Interest expense decreased to $44 million in the first quarter due to a reduction in debt. And our next debt maturity of $320 million is in July of next year. Corporate expense declined to $45 million in the first quarter on an adjusted basis. Although there is variability quarter-to-quarter, we believe this is a reasonable quarterly run rate. Cash utilization. As you know, our cash utilization is typically greatest in the first quarter, primarily due to the payment of incentive compensation awards. Additional uses of cash in the quarter included: $320 million for discretionary pension contributions; $250 million for maturing debt; $125 million for dividends; and $100 million to repurchase 2.7 million shares of our common stock. In fact, this represents the first time since 2004 that we've repurchased stock in the first quarter. And since instituting the current share repurchase program in late 2010, we have repurchased 25 million shares. With that, I am happy to turn it back to Dan.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Mike. And operator, we are ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wanted to just ask about the operating margins, which were excellent in the quarter, relative to what we were thinking. And I think in your commentary, you mentioned that we won't see the same level of increase for the rest of the year. So can you first maybe just talk a bit about how you did so well? And then number two, can you maybe clarify a bit on how we should think about that for the rest of the year?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. Well as we've shown over the past 5 years, we've pretty much aligned expenses and revenues. So when we saw and spoke with you in sort of the back half of last year or going into the back half of last year, we began to anticipate some revenue deceleration, which we saw not only in RIS but more particularly in the discretionary spending areas of our Consulting businesses. And so we started -- we always actively manage expense, but we were -- we definitely keep a very watchful eye on expenses, particularly in this kind of macro environment. And so we started decelerating our expenses as well. And if you look even back to last year, the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we're decelerating, and obviously, in this quarter, where we're overall flat on the expense side. We're feeling a little bit better looking at the future, little bit more optimistic on revenue. But we just wanted to temper the big margin expansion, so there's not an expectation. Because, obviously, we don't know what the top line is. We're out there building our top line. I won't say emphatically that we won't deliver that kind of margin expansion because I don't know what the top line is going to be. But I can say that if we operate the top line like we do right now in that sort of 3% or 4% range, then we would not sustain the 230 basis points quarter-after-quarter.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, that's great. So you're really flexing the expenses to the revenue outlook and you're feeling a bit better there from this point forward. Obviously outside of Oliver Wyman, I would imagine.
Daniel S. Glaser: No, even within Oliver Wyman as well. I'd be happy to hand it over to John to give you a little bit more color about Oliver Wyman and what they feel their prospects are. John?
John P. Drzik: Sure. So if we look at Q1, before talking about the outlook, I mean, our weak performance in Q1 had stemmed from the challenging business conditions we faced in Q4 and in early Q1 this year, where in Europe we had a recessionary economic climate persisting. And in the U.S., business confidence was weak largely due to political uncertainties around the fiscal cliff, the sequestration and sort of stopped awards from discretionary spending, reducing demand for Consulting. So these weak -- it was a weak sales environment for us in Q4 last year and early part of this year and that translated into weak revenues, particularly in the early part of Q1 this year. Now we've seen our sales pick up during Q1 and our business performance has improved each month of the quarter. March was our best month. So looking ahead, we expect Q2 to be better than Q1 based on our current sales and pipeline activity and expect to return to growth in the second half of the year.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: That's great color. And then last is just on the buybacks. It was nice to see the buybacks in the first quarter. As you said, you hadn't done that for almost 10 years. Can you talk about a bit about your appetite for buybacks at the current levels and what we should be expecting?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. Well, I mean, we have increasing free cash flow over the last couple of years. And as we grow earnings, we expect that to continue. And so when we look at uses of cash, we fund some internal investments. But that's fairly rare to get those lumps, because frankly, we run most of our investments through our P&Ls anyway so they don't appear in extra uses of cash. Our dividend is really sacrosanct and we maintain a strong dividend. And then we've got an active pipeline. So we look at acquisitions, really, all over the world. We don't do that many deals, but we certainly look at a lot of them. And we can't really time that out for you. But share repurchase, to us, we believe in the company. So when we have available cash, we will buy back our own shares. Next question.
Operator: And we'll go next to Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit of what you're seeing on the reinsurance side. You, Dan, you referenced softening prices a little bit. And then, vis-à-vis capital market solutions, how you're positioning Carpenter to be a player in that.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. So Alex, over to you.
Alexander S. Moczarski: Okay. In the first quarter, I wouldn't say that there was much effect from rates. Obviously, accounts that we have were affected by Sandy. We saw some stiffening of rates. And in general, rates had a benign effect on the quarter. But certainly, this downward pressure is, one, more capital; two, less cap losses; and three, stronger balance sheets. And so we're expecting to see some downward pressure. But interestingly enough, if there's cheap alternative capital, you look at your capital. We have a trenching tool, and look at the cost of capital. Actually, we may be buying -- some of our clients are actually buying more reinsurance than they bought before. As regards -- how do we deal with this new alternative capital coming in? Well, we've been sort of fairly good at that in the past. We've had a lot of success with our product -- our quill product. And two, we understand that we need to continue to expand our capabilities there. We have a pipeline of hires who understand that business better, understand the appetites of the capital that's coming in. And so we certainly are focused on it, we want to embrace it. And we think that our value to our clients is the advice we give and we'll continue to be valuable.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Great. And then just quickly, Dan, you just talked about buyback. But I'm just curious, what drove the decision to repurchase shares in the first quarter?
Daniel S. Glaser: Mike, you wanted to take that?
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes, thank you, Dan. Larry, as you know, we ended last year with $2.3 billion on our balance sheet in cash and cash equivalents. And so not only was it robust overall, but we were very effective over the course of the third, fourth quarter and early part of the first quarter, of bringing back a lot of that cash into the U.S. on a very tax-efficient basis. So as an outcome of those activities, we had more flexibility in the first quarter. And even though we had a lot of uses for the cash, we felt very comfortable in repurchasing 100 million shares in the quarter.
Daniel S. Glaser: Next question?
Operator: And we'll go next to Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I'm wondering if you could give little bit more color on what's going on with Mercer, particularly in the Retirement area and the Talent area?
Daniel S. Glaser: Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin: Sure. Thanks for the question, Brian. As you saw, and we talked about in the past, in the Talent area, we have there the highest mix of project work consultancy in the globe, which is, of course, more sensitive to economic cycles and discretionary spending decisions of our clients. And there's no question that you can see that those types of decisions by our clients are being very defensive in the days that -- of the quarter and probably for us, in days ahead as well. But look, the strength of Mercer, though, is its diversification. We have significant other businesses that, of course, have ancillary and absolutely repeatable revenue streams. And those that performed very well, as we mentioned already, in the Health area and the Investment area, we saw some really good growth there. And now it's even, off of some very powerful growth that we had in the first quarter 2012 in those areas. So we're feeling pretty comfortable about our prospects to be able to maximize our diversification of our portfolio, so we can continue to grow and also improve profitability.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And can you give an update on how the healthcare exchange has gone?
Julio A. Portalatin: Yes, sure, absolutely. Lots of activity to report there. We recently announced a pretty impressive lineup of participating carriers for Health, sponsored, ancillary and voluntary product choices and are in active with numerous firms who are considering Mercer Marketplace for their employees in 2014 and some in 2015. So firms like Aetna, Cigna and United Healthcare, Humana and Anthem [ph] have decided to participate in our core medical offering, while organizations like Allstate and Met and many others who offer voluntary benefits such as P&C products, ID, theft protection, legal coverage and, of course, the always offered dental and vision and much more. So our goal was to have the most flexible and complete solution in the market for companies of virtually all sizes. And Mercer Marketplace has proven to be just that. We can offer companies a wide range of benefits and carrier choices to offer to their employees. Now we offer employees an excellent buying experience. We're pretty excited about the prospects.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Are you generating revenues out of it yet? And when do you expect to start seeing revenues?
Julio A. Portalatin: No, this is -- the enrollment period for 2014 will start in the fall. So any revenue will fall into '14, not '13.
Daniel S. Glaser: Next question, please.
Operator: And we'll go next to Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I just want to -- I wonder if you could talk a bit more about the margin improvement efforts within the Consulting business. You've had some very nice success there over the past year, and I've been particularly impressed with this quarter, given the weaker organic growth. But I'm wondering, is this -- how far along are you in all the stuff that you've wanted to do there? How much more stuff do you have to do that's in your control? So maybe just give us an overall update on that.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Well, I'll start with that and ultimately hand over to Julio to give you a little bit more color. But we started, really, maybe 18 months ago, talking about how we thought that the Consulting business could be improved on a profitability basis. And that we could take some of the disciplines and approaches that we were using in the RIS side of the business and apply them within Consulting. And we actually moved some people and we used some technology, changed the structure to where it was more aligned with both a geographic and a line of business matrix within Mercer. Oliver Wyman stayed on a line of business basis because it's a different kind of structure and market, and we started the march. And we talked about that, really, from a couple of years ago, and our belief is that we can, similar to the RIS side, manage expenses aligned with what kind of revenue we're seeing and achieve some significant gains in margin over a long period of time. Now, consulting is a little lumpier than RIS. It's got less recurring revenues than RIS, so it might not be quarter by quarter, every single quarter. But over a long period of time, we expect those margins to continue to improve. Now, I'll hand it over to Julio to give you a little bit more color.
Julio A. Portalatin: Thank you, Dan. We're pretty pleased with the continued margin expansion that we're seeing at Mercer. Our top line growth combined with our focus on cost discipline is really what's driving the results. We're going to state this, it's within -- a bit defensive in some places and also continue to invest in others. We have a significant amount of expansion that we expect in the years to come that will hopefully allow us to continue to calibrate our expenses to our growth on revenue. And some of those, you've heard me talk about before, whether it's expansion in the growth market, whether it's expansion in our breadth of products that we have to offer, in our distribution points like Mercer Marketplace and other investments we're making in technology, client-facing technology, especially, I think will pay dividends for us in the future and allow us to continue to calibrate appropriately with our expenses. So we will continue to be disciplined and defensive in some areas, invest in others. And of course, we don't anticipate any additional restructuring. As you know, we announced some in the fourth quarter of last year, but we do expect that as our year goes on, that we'll continue to invest in those things that will give us the top line and expense efficiency that we need.
Daniel S. Glaser: Next question, please.
Operator: And we'll go next to Ray Iardella with Macquarie.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: Dan, maybe just touching on your comment about Oliver Wyman making some moves to protect profitability, just curious if you can give me a little bit more color on those actions.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. I'll address it a little bit, but I think it would be better for me to hand it off to John, who could give you more details. We run our businesses differently. We have 2 segments. And we look at Consulting in a different way than we look at RIS. And so, the models are a bit different. And as we talked about, about a year ago when Oliver Wyman's growth started to come off, we were saying that, that was going to be more of a revenue event than an earnings event. And then Oliver Wyman had a more fungible business model, which is sort of best-in-front in that they could fairly easily move people from one part of the world to another part of the world, so it's not that they carry a lot of stranded cost on expense. And so, let me just hand it over to John to give you some more flavor.
John P. Drzik: Yes, I think there are few other factors behind us protecting our margin in the first quarter. I think, first, given the weak conditions we saw in Q4 2012, we expected Q1 would be challenging from a revenue standpoint. So we took that actions to constrain our operating expenses in that environment. The second point is that our compensation model is very performance sensitive and since it's a major part of our expense base, that part of the expense basis flexes naturally down with our weaker performance. And then finally, I think coming into 2013, we expected our operating profitability of our business portfolio to be stronger. So there were a number of expense investments, for example, that matured through the course of time. And so, the combination of those factors enabled us to protect our margin despite the revenue decline.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe, I don't know, if Peter or Dan, do you want to address this, but the new business in Marsh, is that -- I mean, how much of that is being generated out of the U.S. versus internationally? Is there any sort of flavor you could give in terms of that number?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure, thanks. Let me hand it over to Peter.
Peter Zaffino: Sure, Ray. It's actually quite balanced, the new business, it has been for the last year. The 2 regions where we had the strongest new business in the first quarter were actually the U.S. and Latin America. So while we're seeing from strategic investments, very strong growth in the emerging part of the world, we're also seeing very strong new business for the U.S. And when you look at last year, as Dan opened up with, we're the top comparable. So to get stronger new business year-over-year, really is a tribute to the pipeline and how we're executing.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: Okay. And last one, a numbers one, if I can squeeze it in, for Mike. The CapEx you talked about for 2013, that was $350 million. Is that correct?
J. Michael Bischoff: That's absolutely correct, even including, I think, the $126 million in the first quarter. We typically track around $75 million to $80 million a quarter CapEx rate. You can see in the first quarter of last year, it was about $25 million below it. And in the first quarter, it's above that. But we think then, over the course of the next 3 quarters, it will track more like we normally would see in the neighborhood of $75 million to $80 million, realizing it could be variable quarter-to-quarter.
Daniel S. Glaser: Next question, operator?
Operator: And we'll go next to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Most of my questions have been answered. I guess one question. Can you talk a bit on the U.S. organic and just kind of the renewal book there and kind of what sort of trends you're seeing? Just get some color and just one quick follow-up.
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure, Mike. I'll hand it over to Peter.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And that's on the risk side, I should say.
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure.
Peter Zaffino: Sure. For the U.S. core business, as I said, the new business has been strong, but the biggest contributor is really the renewal retention, revenue retention. And so a strong rollover from last year of new business, very strong client retention. I would say the third factor is modest pricing improvement. So when we look across the different segments within the U.S. business, more of our clients are receiving rate increases than are receiving rate decreases. The lines of business that probably are seeing the biggest increases are D&O more on the financial lines, access and umbrella, workers' compensation. So we have seen some benefit, not much, but some benefit, in the U.S. but it's been offset by the International where there's more headwinds.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So in that environment, I mean, does the size or scale or, how do you view the reasons behind the renewal book sort of improving in quality?
Peter Zaffino: I think the biggest component or lift is really the strong retention that we have for client and the strong rollover we have from the production pipeline. So again, strong new business last year, rollover, more clients, strong retention is really what the biggest contributor is.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And then, I just -- one question, maybe, Dan. Obviously, Berkshire has made a couple big announcements recently. Can you just talk about how either of those either impact your business or how you perceive their impact on the market overall?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. I'm not going to get into the weeds of what other companies are doing in the market. I think it's fair to say that there is plenty of capital in the insurance industry, and that our clients are well-served, and we are good intermediaries to find that capital for them when they need it. And so at the end, the insurance business is pretty healthy. Insurance companies have done pretty well, notwithstanding the big cats of 2011. And as you look at shareholder surplus and that sort of thing, it's an appealing business for many. And so capital is continuing to rise. And on that basis, we'll continue to work with our clients to access whatever capital they need.
Operator: And we'll go next to Adam Klauber with William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Within the Risk P&C business, to supplemental payments, commissions, do they come in more in one quarter than another, or are they pretty evenly spread?
Daniel S. Glaser: Peter?
Peter Zaffino: They're pretty evenly spread. There's no one quarter where we would benefit more than another for any fee or commissions from insurance carriers.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, okay. As far as Europe and the RIS services, do you expect that business to flatten? Or as the environment isn't getting better, the potential of that just continues to drift off?
Daniel S. Glaser: So you're talking about our EMEA segment?
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Yes.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Peter?
Peter Zaffino: That's held up very well. I mean, certainly, we're very cautious, as Dan said, from last year looking into the economic conditions within Europe and other parts of the world. But for us, most of our European countries within EMEA grew, albeit modest. And it's been a real steady performer. And so, there's no signs to suggest that it's going to fall off from its track over the last -- for 6 quarters.
Daniel S. Glaser: One thing to bear in mind, some countries in Continental Europe are sort of weighted toward renewals in the first quarter. So a good start to the year usually signals a decent year for them.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Right, right, okay. And one final question on the health exchanges. I know it's early, but how's your pipeline looking for the 2014 enrollment?
Daniel S. Glaser: Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin: The pipeline is very strong. As you can imagine, we have client and prospects who are very interested in having deep discussions about the Mercer Marketplace alternatives. Many of these conversations are leading to work that may not be directly related to Mercer Marketplace, but thus, we help our consultancy with these prospects and clients as well. So the pipeline is strong. Many are making decisions and we're consulting them on whether or not 2014 is the right timing or 2015 is the right timing for them. So we'll see over the coming months as to who comes on in 2014 and who comes on in 2015.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Operator, I think it's time for 2 or 3 more questions. So are there any other questions?
Operator: Yes, sir. We'll go next to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Most of my questions have been answered. But just in terms of more getting a flavor for the organic growth. I know within Oliver Wyman, you had mentioned seeing trends pick up as we move throughout the quarter. And would you say maybe the same if you're looking in terms of RIS? And also within Mercer, did you see trends kind of improve as we got later on in the quarter? Was it more consistent throughout the 3 months?
Daniel S. Glaser: I think one thing, when you think about RIS and about 70% of Mercer tends to be recurring revenue. So the trends are rarely, do you see acceleration. You basically look at year-over-year in terms of what the renewal date was in the previous year. So I think that Oliver Wyman has often been a good canary for us in terms of determining where the macro environment is going. And Oliver Wyman is anticipating some better trends, particularly towards the back half of the year.
Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then also in terms of the Healthcare investment, from one of the questions earlier, you had said we would more see some of the revenue from those exchanges come up in 2014. Do you anticipate, when we gear up towards 2014 enrollment period later this year, seeing a little bit of a pickup in expenses there that might hit later in the year and then see the revenue early next year? Should we see that maybe impacting margins a little bit later on this year?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. So let me answer that a little bit, and then I'll hand it over to Julio. I think one thing you have to bear in mind when there's such a change like we're seeing in healthcare reform is that the initial waves are largely around existing clients making decisions. And certainly, we're talking to a number of prospects. But most of our time is serving customers, serving existing clients. And so when you think about, okay, if a client may elect to go onto the exchange or they may elect to stay out of an exchange and buy their insurance in a traditional way. So I think at least in the early waves, you have to consider that these are different choices that a client would have. And over a long period of time, what you'll see on successful exchanges will be that they'll be able to build some share because of the quality or breadth of their exchange. Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin: In the first couple of years, we don't expect a significant impact on margins or expenses, quite frankly, as it relates to the exchange in Mercer Marketplace, in particular. I would expect to, obviously, have margins that are more in line with what we're seeing today in the business as years out develop. So I wouldn't expect a little lumpiness in this period of time.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Operator, I think we can take 1 more question.
Operator: And the final question will come from Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Had a question about Guy Carpenter and some of the organic growth. I was wondering if -- how much of the growth in the quarter came from one-time transactions, capital markets alternative as opposed to sort of the traditional renewal book?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Let me address this slightly and then I'll hand over to Alex. I just want to make the point that Guy Carpenter grew 7% organically in last year's first quarter. So they're comparable, with a pretty high comparable, and they've done pretty well against that comparable. Alex?
Alexander S. Moczarski: Clearly, at the beginning of the year on the cap side, we'll be oftentimes selling products which won't necessarily be renewed. But we've been able to do that well. And the bulk of our business continues to be renewable business. And what we've done is we've increased discipline around client service, improved advice, as well as a very focused new business approach. I think we've been able to keep the momentum.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. I was just wondering if there was any like large one-time capital market events that happened?
Alexander S. Moczarski: No. No.
Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: No? Okay. And just one follow-up. I was wondering if there was any additional color on the MMA front on the agency business and how that's looking.
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure, absolutely. Peter?
Peter Zaffino: Yes. The MMA platform is very exciting. We're now approaching almost $500 million in annualized revenues. The acquisition pipeline is quite strong. And again, we don't report in the segments, but they had a very good quarter in terms of growth and profitability in margin expansion. So we're excited. They're actually very focused on how we invest in driving organic growth so it's not just the acquisitions that are going to drive value for MMA. We tend to do less acquisitions for a variety of reasons in the first half of the year. But again, excited about the pipeline and the prospects for future growth.
Daniel S. Glaser: I would just like to thank all of you for joining us on the call this morning. I'd also like to thank our clients for their support of Marsh & McLennan Companies and certainly, our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in delivering such fine results. Have a good day.
Operator: And again, that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Fourth quarter and full year 2012 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning, and they are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's most recent SEC filings, which are available on the Marsh & McLennan Companies' website for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I will now turn this call over to the Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Please go ahead.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results as reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. I'm also very pleased to welcome Keith Walsh, our new Head of Investor Relations. Keith joined us in December following many years of covering the insurance industry as an analyst at Citi. Following my comments, Mike will discuss our financial results in more detail, and then we'll take your questions. I feel truly honored to be leading this call, my first as President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. My principal role as CEO of MMC will be to build on our success, finding new ways to grow, invest, innovate and realize the full potential of our businesses. As many of you know, I was previously Group President and COO of MMC for over 1.5 years and CEO of Marsh for more than 3 years prior to that. During my time as Group President, I also briefly acted as the CEO of Mercer before Julio joined the executive team. It was an invaluable experience for me to have run both Marsh and Mercer. Along with the rest of the executive team, I was actively involved in developing our 4 pillar strategy, first articulated in 2010: growth in revenue and earnings per share, low capital requirements, high cash generation and managing the risk profile of the company. The best thing about our 4 pillar strategy is that we are executing it well. We have successfully generated both revenue and profitability growth over the last 3 years. Further, we have maintained low capital requirements and generated strong free cash flow. This gives us a high degree of flexibility to innovate and expand, particularly in growth markets. It also allows us to return capital to shareholders via a strong dividend and a meaningful share repurchase program. The broad 4 pillars strategic framework will continue to serve us well. Our goal remains to produce at least 10% organic growth in operating income over the long term. Effective capital management, including disciplined deployment of excess cash into acquisitions and share repurchase, should contribute to EPS growth approaching 13% and with our dividend, shareholder returns around 16%. Moving onto our financials. I'm pleased with our fourth quarter results, which reflected our ongoing strong performance over the course of 2012. Reflecting on our performance for the year, we delivered underlying revenue growth of 4%, with growth in each operating company for the third consecutive year. Underlying expense growth was less than 3%, which produced 12% growth in adjusted operating income. And our overall margin increased 120 basis points to 15.6%, an excellent performance. Risk and Insurance Services produced another outstanding year. Underlying revenue growth was 5%, with both Marsh and Guy Carpenter contributing. Adjusted operating income rose 12% with margin expansion to 20.5%, an increase of 130 basis points. This is the segment's highest annual margin since 2003. To put this into perspective, over the last 5 years, we have more than doubled the Risk and Insurance Services adjusted margin from less than 9% to over 20% despite lower fiduciary income, higher pension expense, significant investments in the business and a challenging economic and pricing environment. This speaks to the strength of our core earnings and underlines the operating leverage we have built into the business. Marsh's underlying revenue rose 5% in 2012 with all geographies contributing. Latin America was up 13%; Asia Pacific increased 7%; EMEA grew 5%; and the U.S./Canada region increased 3%. Marsh continued to generate strong levels of new business with $1.1 billion for the year, a new annual record. Guy Carpenter produced 6% underlying revenue growth for the year. This marks 16 consecutive quarters Carpenter has delivered underlying revenue growth. Growth was driven by Carpenter's international operations, particularly global specialties, Asia Pacific, EMEA, Latin America and global facultative. The Consulting segment also delivered solid underlying revenue growth in 2012, with both Mercer and Oliver Wyman contributing to the 4% increase. And we have made substantial progress in the execution of our strategy to increase profitability. Adjusted operating income increased 14% and the adjusted operating margin expanded 140 basis points to 13.2%, Consulting's highest annual margin since 2004. Mercer had a strong year, which represents an excellent start on their path to growing profitability and increasing margins. Underlying revenue grew 4%, reflecting higher revenue across all regions. And every line of business contributed to this growth: as Investments grew 8%; Health & Benefits increased 7%; Outsourcing rose 4%; and both Talent and Retirement grew 1%. Since joining Mercer a year ago, Julio and his team have undertaken a comprehensive review of Mercer's operations. Today, Mercer has been reoriented around 4 core lines of business: Health, Retirement, Talent and Investments. As a result, beginning in the first quarter of 2013, Mercer will no longer report Outsourcing as a standalone business. These services, which generated over $700 million in revenue last year, will remain an important part of Mercer's capabilities. One of Mercer's objectives is to build broader client relationships. More closely aligning administration services with Mercer's core business lines will help achieve this. We also made the decision to transfer the affinity and voluntary benefits businesses of Marsh's U.S. Consumer division to Mercer in the first quarter of 2013. We believe this business, which had $225 million of annual revenue and growth consistent with the Marsh U.S./Canada region, will be further enhanced as part of Mercer. It has become clear to us that traditional and voluntary benefits are converging. So aligning these businesses within Mercer enables us to concentrate our efforts and expertise. Another important development at Mercer is the recent launch of its U.S. health exchange, known as Mercer Marketplace. We are excited to add this new offering to an already robust set of products and solutions in Mercer's Health business. At Oliver Wyman, underlying revenue growth for the year was 3%, which we believe to be a reasonable result given the macroeconomic environment and weakness in Europe. This growth was driven by strong increases in the Health & Life Sciences and Communications practices, complemented by steady growth in Financial Services, Oliver Wyman's largest practice. In closing, we are very pleased with MMC's operational and financial performance. I believe we are well positioned to deliver on our long-term goals, which should lead to superior returns for our shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Mike to review our results in more detail.
J. Michael Bischoff: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue was $300 (sic) [$3] billion, an increase of 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income rose 10% to $450 million and the consolidated margin increased 90 basis points to 15%. GAAP EPS was $0.47. Adjusted EPS grew 13% to $0.52 from $0.46 in last year's fourth quarter. Revenue at Risk and Insurance Services was $1.6 billion, with underlying growth of 3% at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. By holding adjusted underlying expense growth to 1%, adjusted operating income rose 8% to $312 million. Margins expanded by 80 basis points, reaching 19.2% in the quarter. At Marsh, underlying revenue growth was led by a 5% increase in the International division. This included 13% growth in Latin America and 3% for both EMEA and Asia Pacific. Overall, Marsh's revenue growth was driven by record new business production of approximately $300 million. Guy Carpenter continued its long-term trend of solid financial performance and underlying revenue growth. Its 3% growth was led by Canada, U.S. facultative, Latin America, the U.K. and certain global specialties. Turning to our Consulting segment. Revenue was $1.4 billion, reflecting underlying revenue growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income rose 8% to $179 million and the margin expanded 70 basis points to 13%. At Mercer, underlying revenue growth was 6%, its strongest quarter of the year. Excellent growth was achieved at Investments, Health & Benefits and Outsourcing. As you are aware, Oliver Wyman's 3% decline in underlying revenue in the quarter was anticipated due to the weak European economic environment and the timing of revenue recognition between the first and fourth quarters. As was the case for the full year, we saw strong growth in the Health & Life Sciences and Communications practices. MMC's consolidated underlying revenue growth for the year was 4%. Adjusted operating income rose 12% to $1.9 billion and the margin grew 120 basis points to 15.6%. For the year, GAAP EPS was $2.13. Adjusted EPS increased 21% to $2.15. Excluding the early extinguishment of debt in 2011, adjusted earnings growth was 16%. We anticipate annual corporate expense this year will be lower than 2012. Quarterly expenses should average 75 -- I'm sorry, $45 million a quarter. Investment income in the fourth quarter was $4 million. Effective yesterday, Trident II divested its remaining position in AXIS. As a result, MMC's investment income in the first quarter will approach $20 million. Regarding our restructuring in the fourth quarter, the vast majority relates to Mercer. As Dan indicated, this results from Mercer's repositioning as it implements its new long-term strategy. 1/3 of the $51 million expense was due to the sale of a small Canadian outsourcing business, which was announced last October. The balance of the expense included position elimination, software writeoffs and real estate rationalization. We have greatly reduced noteworthy items that are excluded from adjusted operating income. On an expense base of over $10 billion, net adjustments to GAAP for the past 2 years were only $22 million in 2011 and $35 million in 2012. Taxes. For the year, our adjusted tax rate was 30% and we feel this is a reasonable rate to use for financial modeling purposes in 2013. Pension expense. On December 31, interest rates for longer debt maturities used to measure pension liabilities were again lower than the prior year. Based on the year-end measurement, our pension expense will increase this year by $30 million. Moving to capital management. The largest use of our cash in the fourth quarter was $149 million for acquisitions, including 5 at Marsh & McLennan Agency. Today, MMA has annualized revenue of $450 million. Also in the quarter, we used $128 million for dividends and repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock for $50 million. Since instituting our share repurchase program 2 years ago, we have repurchased 22 million shares for almost $700 million. For the year, the major uses of cash included approximately $500 million for dividends, $340 million for acquisitions, $230 million for share repurchase and $200 million for discretionary pension contributions. The use of cash over the course of 2012 approaches $1.3 billion. Additionally, last month, we made a $70 million discretionary contribution to one of our international pension plans. We are prepared to make additional contributions if there is a long-term economic rationale and it can be accomplished in a tax-efficient manner. With that, I am happy to turn it back to Dan.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Mike. And operator, we are ready to begin the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wanted to ask why is the organic growth in the P&C brokerage segment? It was one of the lowest in many quarters and also is now well below peers that have already reported.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. So I think the best thing to do is to go to Peter and Alex on that. So I'll start with Peter.
Peter Zaffino: Sure. Greg, when you look at the variability that happens quarter-to-quarter, I would encourage us to focus on what happens in the year, as well as looking year-over-year. So when I look at U.S. and Canada in 2011, the segment grew at 3% and in 2012, it grew at 3%. When I look at the International growth in 2011, it was 6% and in 2012, it was 6%. So it's challenging to take just a look at the quarter. It's much better to look at what is the last 4 quarters and I think you can see we've had very consistent growth. International has contributed more than the U.S. and Canada. We've had terrific performance from Latin America, where they grew 13% during the year. EMEA, with all of its challenges and economic headwinds, grew 5% for the year. Asia Pac grew 7% for the year. So overall, with the challenging headwinds, we're pleased with what's happened during the year. If I can just comment for a second on what happened in the U.S. and Canada because I'm sure some curiosity as to why it's 0%. Again we look at 2012 and are pleased with the performance. There's always variability and nonrecurring items in quarters. We've mentioned that before, both positive and negative. And having said that, in the fourth quarter, U.S. and Canada did get hit with an abnormal amount of negative variability that impacted the growth in that segment. So again I would encourage us to take a look at the year, the key performance indicators for new business. As Dan mentioned, we had record new business in the year. But we also had record new business in the quarter, including in the U.S. Retention, absent the variability, was consistent with prior quarters and our overall pipeline is quite strong. So when you take a look at the quarter and the year, I'd encourage you to take a look more at the year. And as we look to 2013, we don't give guidance, but the year will reflect more of the growth than the quarter.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Alex?
Alexander S. Moczarski: Yes. I mean, 3% underlying growth, actually I think it was a fairly decent quarter. There was no doubt that last year, it was a more benign year from the point of view of catastrophes. And so there were some pressures on rates. But all in all, we actually did a little bit better than we expected to be in what is our smallest quarter. So I really don't have much to add to that.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Also just one comment, Greg. I think you have to be cautious when looking at peers or your comment with regard to underperformance versus peers. We don't have many peers. And so there may be some reporting which would be more equivalent to a smaller segment within our business. But our RIS business is a $6.5 billion annual business, and we're in every geography in every segment. And so there may be -- we don't have many peers out there.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. So I guess, to just -- very thorough answer. What I'm sort of taking away from it is that empirically, you guys limped into year end in the P&C brokerage segment. So that's just the way it is, and it was actually centered in the U.S./Canada segment as you said, which flies totally in the face of what we're seeing from the peers. But you feel very, very good given where pricing is going in the U.S, given the trends you see that this quarter is not a quarter to be extrapolated into 2013 and beyond. There's nothing in the core business that you see that you want to call out right now that we should be -- that should cause us frankly to all be lowering our organics in that segment going forward.
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, I think your summary is correct.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: The outlook for margin expansion seems to be a bit stronger in Consulting than the Risk and Insurance Services segment. And that certainly was the case for the full year 2012. I was wondering if you could talk about that in relation to your long-term 13% EPS growth target as well.
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. Look, well, first, let me just hand over to Mike.
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes, this is Mike. Just to correct, I would say the margin improvement in Risk and Insurance Services was 130 basis points in 2012 and for Consulting, 140. So I would say that we saw a very significant margin improvement in both of our segments over the course of the year. I just wanted to make sure that, that was factually correct right there.
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes. And Jay, when we look at the businesses, of course, RIS started earlier, right, in terms of really focusing on the business disciplines and profit improvement. And we really started getting going in Consulting with the arrival of Julio and Julio's leadership team at Mercer and forming strategies around improving profitability. And so when we look at both segments where we stand today, I'm actually quite optimistic that we have the ability over the next few years to continue to expand margins in each of our segments. And I wouldn't really put an emphasis on larger margin expansion in Consulting versus RIS. I think that there's capabilities in both to do that. Of course, it remains -- it's subject to the overall environment, the GDP environment around the world, the macroeconomic environment, a little bit of the PC -- P&C pricing cycle. But ultimately, as long as we can achieve modest levels of revenue growth, we feel comfortable that we will be able to continue to expand our margins in both segments.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And with regard to the organic expense growth, Mike, I think you talked about 3% underlying. And is that something that can persist?
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes. I mean, certainly, Jay, when we look at how we run the business, we have been continually investing in the business over the last several years and very much focused on creating mid- and long-term value for our shareholders. And so when we look at the expense base, we've been wearing those investments, we've been wearing some higher pension costs, et cetera. And we believe we can continue to do that.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Meyer Shields with Stifel.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Dan, you talked a little bit about changing the segment reporting within Mercer. When you talk about including the affinity stuff from Marsh, is that going to have a material margin impact?
Daniel S. Glaser: No, it will not. I mean, the margins of that business are relatively consistent with the overall margins of the Consulting segment.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. Can I infer from that, that it'll boost margins in Risk and Insurance a little bit?
Daniel S. Glaser: If you want to cut a fine line to it, yes, the math works that way. But it would be so small relative to the size of RIS that it would barely turn up.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. When you look at both segments, I'm talking about the 2013 outlook, are you budgeting for or expecting any slowdown in consumer spending because of higher payroll taxes?
Daniel S. Glaser: When we look at our business from a budgeting perspective, we tend to look at where the business has been performing over the course of like a rolling 4 quarters basis and what the macro environment looks like on a rolling 4 quarters. So we don't put any real optimism into our numbers based upon the fact that we feel that at least the sentiment seems to be improving a bit from where it was midyear last year. And on the other hand, we don't put many pessimistic thoughts in there, too, as to the impacts of something like a payroll tax. So ultimately, our business should perform a little bit above GDP in most jurisdictions. And so that's probably, on a broad sense, the more accurate thing to look at.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: I'm wondering if you could just talk about the underlying insurance pricing impact that you felt in 2012 for the year. And I know it's incredibly early in 2013 but perhaps look into the crystal ball and see how the impact in '13 might compare with '12.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. So I think that question as well, Larry, is probably best for Peter and for Alex. So Peter, why don't we start with Marsh?
Peter Zaffino: Sure. Thanks, Larry. And let me start with the fourth quarter. We measure what's called a Marsh Risk Management Global Insurance Index, and that rose 1.2% on a global basis. If you think about how our portfolio splits in the quarter, it's about 49% U.S., 51% International. If I look back on the first, second quarter, in the U.S., we started to see a lot more probably modest increases in property, started to see more momentum in some of the more stressed casualty lines. And I would say that's continued in the third and fourth quarter, although modest increase when you compare quarter-to-quarter. The International business, again, a lot harder to just give a statement because they're in different geographies, there's different lines of business, but generally speaking, that's been fairly flat. Some lines of business have increased. I would think more around peak zone properties, so if you go into Asia, if you go into Pacific, parts of Latin America and then other segments' lines of business have been coming off. So on average, I would think for the year that the International has been flat. And again with the U.S., we've had a little bit of an impact on Sandy, not much. And that started to fall off a little bit in the fourth quarter.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Alex?
Alexander S. Moczarski: Yes. On the reinsurance side, really as I said before, the year was benign from the point of view of catastrophes compared certainly to a year prior. And we saw some general softening. Sandy probably strengthened the resolve of some underwriters to try and keep some pricing. And if you had a portfolio that was affected by Sandy, I believe there were some price increases. But we didn't see any tailwind from rating so far in the renewals for 2013.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Great. And then just one housecleaning. Mike, with Trident's sale of AXIS, is that going to effectively eliminate investment income post the first quarter?
J. Michael Bischoff: Larry, that's a very good question. We do have investments in a number of other private equity firms. But the issue really that has caused running through our P&L is the accounting treatment for private equity firms when they hold a public company. And essentially, that was AXIS that Trident II held. And so when they marked it to market for each quarter, we would have to realize that through our P&L in the subsequent quarter. And so with Trident II essentially being closed down, it essentially then means that we would really not have, after the first quarter, much running through our investment income line.
Operator: Moving on, we'll hear from Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just wanted to expand, if I could, a little on the kind of pricing and market conditions commentary. Where are you seeing the impact of firming market conditions in the U.S. impacting your results, whether on a revenue or margin basis? And then just one follow-up.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Peter?
Peter Zaffino: The pricing, if you translate it to our results, again, we saw some changes in the market based on Sandy in the fourth quarter. And I really put them into 3 categories. One is pricing. So if you had Northeast exposure, loss-affected or flood-exposed, you started to see pricing. There has been as much focus on coverage. I mean, we saw a lot about storm surges. Is it in the wind or is it in flood? Deductibles increasing. And then looking at capacity and how that's going to be impacted in the future. The U.S., our business has been moving more to commission, but we still have a split of a fee and commission, and then we also have a business that's well populated with high deductibles, or SIRs, which will be less affected than a guaranteed cost and what you perhaps are seeing in the market for what's happening with pricing. So overall, I think the pricing had a modest impact and in line with what we said for the global index, which was in the 1% to 2% range.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So does the fact that you're securing better rate for your customers than the market overall, how -- does that manifest in retention? Does that -- like other than just pure margin, how do you see firming market conditions in the U.S. impacting your business overall?
Peter Zaffino: The firming conditions, I think, will have a couple of impacts. One would be, as you mentioned, on the retention. So we will tend to retain more clients based on the service capabilities, our ability to execute on claims. And I also believe that there's a flight to quality when there's a challenge in placing business. And we have tremendous expertise in our infrastructure for line of business, for industries' segments. And we're well represented across the U.S. in terms of how we trade with markets. And so our clients tend to want to stay and we have prospects that tend to want to come. So I would expect to see that new business trend to be strong, retentions to be strong and for us to be able to grow as a result of it.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And then just, Dan, if I could, just on deployment. About $1.3 billion-ish to spend, if our math is right, maybe half of that dividends and pension. First question is, is that still the right way to think about that? And second is how do you think about the other half? I mean, are you biased towards building out MMA, the agency platform? Or do you see more value on the buyback side?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, okay. So I do think that our dividend is pretty sacrosanct over the last 50 years, and that's going to be a call on our free cash each year. Pension, as Mike was saying in his script, will vary in terms of discretionary contributions to pension based upon the economic rationale and the tax efficiency of doing those sorts of things. And that may vary over time. In terms of the balance between acquisitions and share repurchase, I would say we are always focused on creating value for shareholders. And so therefore, we are looking at, in making acquisitions, what adds to the strength of Marsh & McLennan Companies, what creates additional value that we would be able to then achieve over the mid- and long-term. And our own thought process is that as long as we acquire well, we should be able to build more value through acquisitions than any other means. Having said that, acquisitions, even when you have a reasonable pipeline, you can't predict year-by-year of how much you're going to spend with acquisitions. And so therefore, share repurchase remains a very viable and appropriate way for us to utilize excess cash. Buying back around $700 million over the last 2 years has been pretty consistent and a significant sum. We have a share repurchase authorization up to $1 billion. Clearly, authorizations are board decisions, but we would expect that our board would consider that sort of thing in the future. And certainly, we think that share repurchase would be a good use of excess cash when we don't have acquisitions to make.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So acquisitions first, then buybacks?
Daniel S. Glaser: Correct. I wouldn't say acquisitions. I would say good acquisitions, accretive acquisitions.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Two questions. The first, in Mercer, with the change in the presentation where you're, I guess, getting rid of Outsourcing, I assume that will just be merged into the other businesses.
Daniel S. Glaser: Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin: Yes. Thank you, Jay. Yes, I want to make it clear that I certainly wouldn't qualify our change as getting rid of Outsourcing. We are very much committed to keeping our Outsourcing business alive and well and a viable option for our clients. We know that there are administrative supports that are necessary in order for us to be able to drive the high-margin business and value proposition to our clients for core offerings like Retirement, core offerings like H&B or Health & Benefits, and of course, Investments. And so with that, we will have the Outsourcing that supports those businesses be part of the P&L in those businesses and also part of the overall strategy to expand and broaden our client relationships. So Outsourcing will exist inside the lines of businesses that it supports.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And when I said get rid of it, I just meant from a financial reporting standpoint. But thanks for that for mentioning that. And Julio, while you're on the phone there, can you talk about the exchange that you launched and what your outlook is? And when do you think it could actually help from an earnings standpoint?
Julio A. Portalatin: Thanks again, Jay. As many are aware, just a few weeks ago, we announced the launch of Mercer Marketplace, which is our active exchange for the U.S. market. And we're really excited about the new offering. Mercer Marketplace is a private, active benefit exchange designed to help employers and their employees more effectively manage their benefit costs while providing employees and their dependents with superior choice, flexibility and service. So the employees of our clients will have access to a broad array of traditional as well as voluntary benefits from multiple insurance providers. And along with education tools, which is very important, to support and help employees customize their choices and to better fit their needs and make informed decisions. Our exchange can be scaled for employees with -- or employers with very few employees, as well as the largest of employers with thousands of employees. It goes live for enrollment for the 2014 enrollment period, which means we'll be up and going by the end of the year during the enrollment time. So we're in discussions with several of our clients, as you can imagine, there's been varying degrees of interest as we move forward. I really want to focus on the fact that the whole exchange arena continues to be a developing type of market for us and various others. And I think what's important now is to ensure that we have some sort of distinction in the way we are offering our exchange versus others. So Mercer's Marketplace, as I said, is going to be very scalable. It will offer a complete set of solutions and products across a full scale, ranging from medical, life, disability, et cetera, et cetera. The platform accommodates both insured and self-insured plans. I want to make that clear, it accommodates both insured and self-insured plans. And we'll offer a lot of plan designs and support a broad defined contribution strategy for our health and welfare benefit. So as you can see, it's going to be quite a launch for us as we move forward with it. There will be some really good competitive advantage, and we'll continue to actually calibrate our investments for the Mercer Marketplace as we validate proof of concepts and testing that we'll be doing along the way to ensure that it really appeals to our target audience.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Ray Iardella with Macquarie.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: Maybe just wanted to touch a little bit more on sort of the restructuring in the quarter and the reorientation within Mercer. And I know kind of one of the beneficial points in the past is your ability to absorb some of the restructuring costs. I'm just curious -- and I know, Mike, you gave some numbers around the adjustments to operating income. But restructuring costs are up year-over-year. So I'm just curious are you guys planning to change sort of your ability to absorb restructuring costs? Kind of how should we think about potential restructuring? Or is sort of the operating platform such a way that you guys would like at this point?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay, Ray. So it's Dan here. There's no change in our philosophy with regard to restructuring and there is no thought in our minds that our ability to absorb normal course types of changes to the business and structures is any different than it has been over the last couple of years. So I would look at this more along the lines of Julio and his team doing a kind of drains up review, comprehensive review of their business. And usually, a new CEO gets about one crack at that. So well done, Julio, and we move on from here.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: That's helpful. And just, I guess, following up on cash on the balance sheet. Just curious, do you know how much cash you guys hold onshore versus offshore at year end and maybe talk about how to get that cash offshore back into the U.S.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Mike, do you want to take that?
J. Michael Bischoff: Sure, Dan, I'd be happy to. Well, actually we were very effective in bringing our cash onshore. At the end of the year, we have $933 million of cash in the U.S. out of the $2.3 billion.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: Okay, that's helpful. And then last quick, if I can squeeze it in. In terms of debt, you guys have a maturity coming, I guess, this month. How should we think about debt, given your debt to capital is around 30% and debt to EBITDA is around 1.3x?
Daniel S. Glaser: Mike?
J. Michael Bischoff: Thank you, Dan. You're absolutely right. We have a $250 million debt maturity this month. Let me first say that we have no plans to actively delever our balance sheet beyond where we are today. We think with the growth in the earnings that we'll see -- not just the last few years but we'll see in the coming years, we'll effectively continue to delever the balance sheet and improve our credit metrics, which are important to us. That said and the fact that we were very successful in bringing back quite a bit of cash into the U.S. for a variety of uses, the timing of when we essentially will fund that debt maturity over the course of the year, I think, is still open. So we'll be very attentive to when we go back into the debt markets. So it will be done this year, but the timing of it is yet to be determined.
Operator: Moving on, we'll hear from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Coming back to a little bit on Greg's question earlier in the call. Can you subdivide a little bit the growth rates for middle markets, upper middle markets and large case business, so we can like sort of try and then pace out what 2013 is going to look like?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes. No, we're not going to segment our business on growth rates because we feel if we did that, we would then do it every quarter and it would create a lot of management time to create the information and vet it properly for external reporting. Let me just say this. The small commercial business in the Marsh & McLennan Agency is probably the area that is most appropriately matched against the peer group that some of you have been thinking about. And in our view, the core brokerage business within Marsh & McLennan Agency is performing at our expectations and is consistent overall with what we would expect looking at their peer group.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And which is a smaller peer group, obviously.
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, that would be a smaller peer group.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And so in thinking about in terms of the opportunity going forward, when you were looking at the pricing, I mean, we've seen that there's obviously the tailwind coming from the middle market segment. What do you think is the -- this time next year, what will we be seeing for the large case business in terms of sort of the tailwind? Do you think it will catch up to the smaller middle market business in terms of pricing?
Daniel S. Glaser: There's a couple of ways to approach that question, Joshua. I think on an overall sense, in Peter's commentary or answer to the previous -- one of the previous questions, he was saying you should really look at the year of both top line for Marsh overall but also specifically with regard to the U.S./Canada division. I think one interesting point, which might be a little bit different, which I'll ask Peter to expand on, is that Marsh has made significant progress over the last few years converting some of their book and growing the commissionable book in some of their offerings. So Peter, you want to expand on that?
Peter Zaffino: Sure. We have new business each year that represents around 15% to 20% of our revenue and we have been very conscientious of trying to convert the new business to as much commission versus fee. And I think in the past, we had said that we are around 50-50 fee versus commission. And now when you look at the -- in fourth quarter, the portfolio in its entirety, it's now around 40% fee, 60% commission. And that is a positive because, again, one, it is more transparent with clients, although certainly fees are transparent. Is that it's more aligned with the market in terms of when you'd perhaps see some pricing increases, you may perhaps see less, depending on what geography, what line of business, what segment and what's happening at that point in time in those specific areas.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Does that make any changes in employee retention if you're higher commission rates?
Peter Zaffino: I'm sorry?
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: If more of the business is coming from commission rather than fees, does that change employee retention characteristics at all?
Daniel S. Glaser: When we look at revenue retention, any lift, whether it's fee lift or commission lift, would benefit revenue retention. So clearly, it doesn't do anything with account retention. But with regard to revenue retention, it would. But we try to get higher fees as well when we talk year-over-year with our clients. So really, any lift in fees or commissions help revenue retention.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Adam Klauber with William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: In Consulting, it looked like both H&B and also Outsourcing were pretty strong for the quarter. I guess, 2 questions. One, was there any project revenue that helped either of those segments? And would you say the outlook going into 2013 for both those areas is continuing strong or even getting better as we go into 2013?
Daniel S. Glaser: Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin: So, thanks for the question. Let me start off first by saying that we were pretty pleased with the overall results that we had at Mercer on the revenue side for the entire year and the fourth quarter as well. You can see in the H&B line, that actually has been picking up quarter-by-quarter with this fourth quarter now being our strongest. We continue to see a lot of benefit and a lot of consultancy work coming out of all the clarification that happened around the Affordable Care Act. There is significant amount of activity with both state consultancy that we're doing, as well as client consultancy that we're doing. And we continue to also see a lot of interest in understanding how to be able to control costs and bring extra choice to employees, and thus a lot of interest in discussing and evaluating different options and approaches going forward. I think that it's fair to say that the H&B business is going to continue to see that type of demand of our services and I think we're well positioned for that. And I would ask you to think about that more along the lines of what the annual growth rate was for H&B, which was somewhere around 7% as opposed to the fourth quarter growth rate. I think it's more indicative to look at full year. And as far as Outsourcing is concerned, that was benefited by some, let's say, project work, out-of-scope project work. It continues to benefit from that. Outsourcing could be a little lumpy as the year goes on because of that very nature of project work that we can -- that we get. We saw that in the fourth quarter. It will continue to be kind of lumpy. And again I would point you to the annual growth rate for Outsourcing of somewhere around 4%.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And one follow-up on the health care exchange. Do you have or at what point will you have a, I guess full suite or adequate suite of health insurers as part of that exchange? And also how long do you think it will take you to be up to speed to handle a large national client?
Julio A. Portalatin: Yes, we'll be -- well, let me take the first part of the question first. As you can imagine, we're in active discussions right now with carriers. There is a lot of interest coming from them and I'm sure that soon enough we'll have an opportunity to discuss more specifically how many we'll have on as we go into the 2014 enrollment period that, of course, will take place later on in 2013. As far as going forward and where do we see it developing, I think as I mentioned earlier, there's a lot of moving parts in this, not just for ourselves but for our competitors. I think those who are going to win in this space are ones that can really understand the distinction and differentiation that'll be necessary in order to be able to have the appeal that is needed in the marketplace and in the targets that we're going to be focusing on. So stay tuned, I guess, is the best way to say how we're going to move forward. And there'll be development and we'll continue to keep you abreast of them as they continue to develop throughout the year.
Daniel S. Glaser: If I might just add to that for a second. I mean, one of the reasons, and there were many reasons of moving the U.S. Consumer business to Mercer, is Julio's, in particular, expertise and leadership roles that he has had in his career in consumer businesses. And Julio, do you want to just expand a little bit on the call center operations that we're moving over?
Julio A. Portalatin: Yes. There was a question earlier that talked -- that had asked a little bit about some of the reasoning perhaps for bringing the Consumer business of Marsh over. And I think there's a lot of pretty obvious ones. One is that you see the converging of the core medical health benefits and voluntary benefits happening more and more. There's a blurring of the lines between those 2 offers. We have a very expansive way to be able to handle that on the Mercer side and it just makes sense to put it together for the U.S. in that fashion. Also, as importantly is that as we build an appropriate offering for our exchanges, is an important element, as Dan mentioned, of the Consumer business that actually incorporates licensed agency call centers that allows us to obviously fulfill then more adequately the type of demands that we're going to see through the exchange. And then since Dan mentioned it, I guess I'll mention it as well, and that is that I have had extensive consumer market experience internationally and in the U.S. over my previous lives prior to joining Mercer, and certainly look forward to be able to bring more value out of that business for our organization as we go forward into the future. So there's a lot of really good reasons for doing this. And I think it does give us some sort of strength and differentiation in the way we'll be going through exchanges, as well as other aspects I mentioned on the voluntary and core Health & Benefits.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: One quick follow-up. As you further develop the exchanges, will expenses -- will you need to ramp-up expenses in the near term to do that?
Daniel S. Glaser: Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin: Thank you, Dan. We are carefully assessing the investments that are necessary and the returns that we should get from that investment or those investments on a short-, medium- and long-term basis. We're very disciplined about that. We'll continue to calibrate that appropriately. Don't want to overinvest early, don't want to underinvest. So I think it's really one of those things that we'll continue to look at. We'll continue to make sure it's properly aligned. But the focus is and continues to be margin expansion at Mercer, okay? We've had it in this year, we expect that we are going to continue down that path going forward. And we believe that exchanges will be a part of being able to contribute to that margin expansion as time goes on.
Operator: We will go to Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.
J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: A little bit of a follow-up here. Where exactly is housed this sort of critical, smallish business -- basically the 50 under lives and other type businesses at Marsh? I'm guessing it's pretty small. I know that Marsh Agency writes at least some of it, but geographically, where should we be looking for it when we get to that point where we need to see how things change?
Daniel S. Glaser: If I can understand your question properly, I'll just rephrase it and let me know if I've got it right. You're looking to where we have essentially H&B business in the 50 lives or under category.
J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Right. Because I think that's the business that is most likely to be changed one way or the other at the end of the year.
Daniel S. Glaser: And you're right. We would have some of that business in Marsh & McLennan Agency and some of that business in Mercer. But even if you put them together, it would not move the needle for us in either H&B or our overall revenue for Marsh or Mercer. We just don't have a lot of that business.
J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Is that business -- in your view, I know it's small. But maybe you'll have an opinion because I think it's a bit -- a much bigger issue for others that you'd like to voice. Is that business going to increasingly a self-insurance model? Or do you think it will just all go to the exchanges?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes. I think ultimately, because we're not large in that space, we read all the same commentary that you do. I think you can be comfortable that we're not going to -- we don't have strategy to drive into that space.
Operator: Our last question today will come from Thomas Mitchell with Miller Tabak.
Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: In the risk side of things, the insurance brokerage business, I sort of tried to work with what I think of as a classic model of exposures, growth in exposures times growth in rate times underlying inflation and the values of things that are being insured times whatever your average fee or commission is. Now when I think along those lines, and I'm sure you follow this, you must think about it better than I do, the question that I come up with, if we look at just from your perspective the difference between U.S. and International with respect to the general trends in those 4 factors, is there something that emerges clearly? Because there is a clear contrast between your 3% annual growth rate in the U.S. and what underwriters were saying about the opportunities to write business that was available to them in the fourth quarter. And I'm wondering if you could spell it out a little more clearly.
Daniel S. Glaser: I think for the last number of years, we have grown faster internationally than we have grown in the U.S./Canada division. And the underlying factor that drives that is there is more growth in the world than there has been in the developed U.S./Canada division. And so we have been grinding it out in U.S./Canada and in other -- some other parts of the developed world with good organic growth strategies. And we're pleased to be growing most often above GDP, even in the developed world. But we're -- in the RIS side, we're in 90 different countries. And so when there's more growth in the world, we're there to catch it. Now some of that growth frankly comes from the developed world into the developing world and so our client relationships in U.S./Canada and in Europe, to name 2 parts of the developed world, we capture in places like Latin America, Asia and Africa. But I wouldn't read too much more into it. There's more GDP growth outside U.S./Canada than there is inside. And that's the main factor that you see a differential growth rate. Thank you. And thank you, operator. Before ending this call, I'd like to just reiterate how honored I am to lead Marsh & McLennan Companies. I will keep a keen focus on 3 core constituencies: colleagues, clients and shareholders. This call is naturally oriented toward meeting our commitment to shareholders. I also want to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for our 54,000 colleagues for their hard work and professionalism and to our tens of thousands of clients for their belief in Marsh & McLennan. Thank you very much.
Operator: And that does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you, all, for joining.

Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Third quarter 2012 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on Marsh & McLennan Companies' website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, like remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risk and uncertainties. In particular, references during this conference call to anticipated or expected results of operations for 2012 or subsequent periods are forward-looking statements, and Marsh & McLennan Companies' actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. Please refer to Marsh & McLennan Companies' most recent SEC filings, as well as the company's earnings release, which are available on the Marsh & McLennan Companies' website, for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn the call over to Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Brian Duperreault: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our results as reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and COO; and Mike Bischoff, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Following my comments, Dan and Mike will discuss our operating and financial results in more detail. As you all know, I'll be retiring at the end of the year, so today is my last time that I will have the pleasure of leading our earnings call. I'll say a little more about that later after we review our results. First, I would like to take a minute to discuss the effects of Sandy, a storm of historic proportions. As you're all aware, recovery efforts are underway and the sense of normalcy is returning to impacted areas. Full recovery in parts of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut may take months, if not years. The safety of our colleagues has been our first priority, and we are grateful that we have received no reports of serious injuries. From a business perspective, we are fortunate that our offices have not sustained any significant damage. Our colleagues are working diligently to assist clients who have been affected by this disaster. We also commend our colleagues for the compassion and concern they have shown each other and for doing everything they can for their communities. The storm underscores the critical nature of insurance and the crucial services we provide to clients. While the market impact of Sandy is yet to be determined, generally, there is sufficient capital in the market. However, we do expect the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions will be under more scrutiny from underwriters on the heels of 2 major storms within 14 months. Moving to our financial results. I'm pleased with our third quarter results, which reflect our ongoing strong performance this year. We continue to deliver growth in underlying revenue and earnings in both of our operating segments. This reflects our continuing progress in establishing Marsh & McLennan Companies as an elite enterprise. In the third quarter, consolidated underlying revenue growth was 3%. Combined with ongoing control of expenses and effective capital management, we produced double-digit growth in adjusted operating income and earnings per share, an excellent performance. Risk and Insurance Services produced another strong quarter. Underlying revenue growth was 4%, with both Marsh and Guy Carpenter contributing. Adjusted operating income rose 13% with Marsh, an expansion of 130 basis points. The Consulting segment also delivered solid underlying revenue growth in the third quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 15%, reflecting double-digit growth at both Mercer and Oliver Wyman. The adjusted operating margin expanded 180 basis points. We've seen higher margins for the Consulting segment each quarter this year. Both segments produced excellent results for the year-to-date as well, with solid underlying revenue growth, double-digit earnings growth and substantial margin improvement. We are pleased with this performance. And with that, let me turn it over to Dan to review our third quarter results in more detail.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Brian and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, Marsh & McLennan delivered strong financial performance. We achieved increased underlying revenue growth at each operating company, which extends this trend of growth into the third consecutive year. Continued top line growth, combined with prudent expense management, produced a 12% increase in adjusted operating income. Risk and Insurance Services revenue rose 2% in the third quarter, which is our seasonally lightest quarter. Underlying revenue growth was 4%. Adjusted operating income increased 13% to $213 million, and the adjusted operating margin improved 130 basis points in the quarter and 150 basis points year-to-date. While producing these excellent results, we continued to make investments to enhance client service and improve operational efficiencies. Marsh produced another strong quarter. Underlying revenue rose 4% with all geographies contributing. Asia Pacific increased 7%; EMEA grew 5%; Latin America rose 5%; and the U.S./Canada division increased 3%. Marsh continued to generate strong levels of new business of $260 million in the quarter. Guy Carpenter produced another quarter of underlying revenue growth, a trend we have seen each of the last 15 quarters. On last quarter's earnings call, we indicated that Guy Carpenter would likely see only modest revenue growth in the second half of this year, since July renewal pricing stabilized for property catastrophe coverage and several key clients increased their risk retention levels. And we saw this in the third quarter, with Guy Carpenter's underlying revenue growth of 1%. Turning to our Consulting segment, underlying revenue increased 3%. Coupled with expense discipline, Consulting's third quarter results demonstrate substantial progress in the execution of our strategy to increase profitability. Both Mercer and Oliver Wyman contributed to the segment's double-digit growth in earnings and a significantly higher operating margin. Adjusted operating income rose 15% to $192 million. The adjusted operating margin increased 180 basis points to 14.3%, which is the segment's highest margin in 7 years. At Oliver Wyman, underlying revenue growth in the quarter was 3%. Financial Services, Oliver Wyman's largest sector, was the primary driver of this growth. Geographically, Oliver Wyman's revenue increase was driven by the North American region as we have seen throughout the year. We are expecting a modest decline in underlying revenue for Oliver Wyman in the fourth quarter due to 2 factors. In Europe, Oliver Wyman continues to feel the impact of slower economic growth and declining business confidence and as we discussed previously, the timing of revenue from contracts with acceptance criteria improved Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth by 3 percentage points in the first quarter, and will reduce revenue by the same amount in the fourth quarter. Mercer’s third quarter underlying revenue grew 3%. This increase reflected higher revenue across all regions, with the strongest growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Looking at Mercer’s underlying revenue by line of business, Investments grew 10%; Health & Benefits increased 7%; Outsourcing rose 2%; Talent, Rewards & Communications was up 1%; and Retirement was flat. In conclusion, we are very pleased with the company's growth and profitability in the third quarter. Our leadership team and our colleagues have continued to deliver exceptional performance consistent with our long-term goals to produce adjusted operating income growth of at least 10%, adjusted EPS growth approaching 13% and total shareholder return of 16%. As we have said before, while we may not achieve double-digit earnings growth every year, we remain confident that we can produce this level of growth over the long term. Before I turn it over to Mike, I'd like to say a few words about Brian. To say we are a very different company today than we were 5 years ago is an understatement. Under his leadership, we restructured and repaired our Risk and Insurance business, successfully navigated the Great Recession, settled legacy issues that were impeding our ability to grow and invest, streamlined and strengthened our portfolio and dramatically improved our financial results. Today, we are a growing, thriving organization built for long-term success. Our financial performance speaks for itself. What isn't captured on our income statement is the sense of pride Brian restored to the organization, the belief that we truly belong among the world's elite companies. We owe him a debt of gratitude. So on behalf of our leadership team, our colleagues and our shareholders, I thank Brian for his unparalleled leadership. With that, let me turn it over to Mike.
J. Michael Bischoff: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. I think we all feel the same way about Brian. Our consolidated revenue was $2.8 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income rose 12% to $358 million, and the adjusted operating margin increased 120 basis points to 12.6%. GAAP earnings per share was $0.44 and $0.43 from continuing operations. Adjusted earnings per share grew from $0.24 in the third quarter of last year to $0.39 this quarter. But last year's third quarter results included a cost of $72 million or approximately $0.09 per share related to the early extinguishment of debt. So we feel the true growth of EPS on an adjusted basis in the third quarter was 18%, a very strong performance. For the 9 months, consolidated underlying revenue growth was 5%. Adjusted operating income rose 13% to $1.4 billion and the adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points to 15.8%. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.66. Adjusted earnings per share increased 25%. But excluding the early extinguishment of debt, the growth in adjusted EPS was 17%. In looking at year-to-date profitability by segment, adjusted operating income for Risk and Insurance Services increased 13% to $1 billion with a margin of 20.9%, reflecting an increase on a year-over-year basis of 150 basis points. For our Consulting segment, adjusted operating income increased 17% to $528 million with a year-to-date margin of 13.2% or an improvement of 160 basis points. We recently closed 2 Marsh & McLennan agency acquisitions, representing approximately $30 million of revenue. Over the past 3 years, Marsh & McLennan Agency has acquired 24 companies, with annualized revenue now totaling over $400 million. Many of these acquisitions include contingent consideration or earn outs. These balance sheet liabilities are adjusted quarterly to reflect changes to the company's projections of revenue and earnings. We believe it is appropriate to exclude these adjustments from our adjusted earnings as shown in our supplemental schedules on Pages 9 and 10. Interest expense was $44 million in the third quarter compared with $49 million last year, and the only debt maturity we have over the next 18 months is the $250 million senior note due in February of 2013. With respect to investment income for the fourth quarter, we anticipate it to be de minimis, an improvement from the $4 million loss in the fourth quarter of last year. Now turning to capital management. Our cash position at the end of September exceeded $2 billion and in deploying our excess cash in the third quarter, we used $127 million for dividends, $30 million for acquisitions and $80 million to repurchase 2.3 million shares in the quarter. In fact, over the last 2 years, we have repurchased 21 million shares for $627 million, leaving $373 million remaining under our current board authorization. With that, I am happy to turn it back to Brian.
Brian Duperreault: Thank you, Mike. Well, this is my 20th call since I joined Marsh & McLennan Companies in January 2008, and during that time, we've been able to build on our progress each quarter. Extremely gratifying to think about how far we've come. I've said many times that joining this organization was a calling, and reestablishing the company to its preeminent position is truly one of the highlights of my career. I am leaving this great company in extremely capable hands. The Board of Directors and I have every confidence that Dan will continue to capitalize on the strengths of Marsh & McLennan to deliver superior value to its clients, shareholders and colleagues. In closing, I'd like to thank our colleagues for choosing to do business with -- our clients for choosing to do business with us, our shareholders for their continued confidence and most importantly, our colleagues, everything we have accomplished over the last 5 years is due to their efforts. And with that operator, let's begin the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Wanted to just go into the organic growth side. It sounds like Oliver Wyman's slowing down into the fourth quarter and really, it's a world where the macro seems to be getting a bit slower. So how do you guys feel about the organic from here? And then very importantly, what is your ability or visibility on the margin side as organic comes in perhaps a little slower than what we've enjoyed in previous -- in the previous couple of years.
Brian Duperreault: Okay, Greg. I think Dan may start this, but we might hear from the other guys. Dan?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. So overall, I think you're right in saying that the macro factors probably have more of a immediate influence on Oliver Wyman than other operating companies because more of their revenue is project work as opposed to annuitized or productized types of capabilities that reoccur each year. We separate out the view of organic growth from really where we're going to expand our margin. We look at our revenue and our expenses as being very much aligned, and we look at how we'll do on the revenue side as we think about what kind of inflation we could accept within the expense side. You can grow your margin really in any environment. Sometimes, it doesn't make sense to grow your margin in certain environments, but each of our operating companies are different. And when we look forward, we're quite comfortable that both of our segments will be able to continue to grow their margins over a pretty long stretch of time and both segments have different needs in terms of what revenue growth that they would need in order to comfortably expand their margins. So why don't -- why doesn't John expand a little bit just specifically on what Oliver Wyman's facing?
John P. Drzik: So I think on last quarter's call, we had indicated that we had seen some weakening in business conditions in our pipeline for the second half of the year. So you saw the pace of our growth dropped in the third quarter, and we're now, as Dan highlighted in his comments, expecting to see some further weakening in fourth quarter next year tied to business conditions, principally the weaker business conditions that we're seeing in Europe, but even in North America, we're seeing some weakening. So that is affecting us, so that is the planning context that we're using for the future as well. And as Dan highlighted, I think that we can continue to build the business and grow our margin even in some weakened business conditions.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Is that a commentary just for Oliver Wyman or is that more for the overall Consulting segment?
Daniel S. Glaser: We don't disclose margin specifically for Mercer or Oliver Wyman separately, so it is for the overall Consulting segment.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. But you guys are feeling very confident that the margin trajectory can continue even in a world where the organic were to slow? And we don't know what it's going to do several quarters out, but that's a world which you guys can navigate and hit the 10% up income guidance.
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes. But I wouldn't make a blanket statement quite that broadly. I mean, because as I was saying before, there would be certain market environments where it surely would be poor for the business' midterm and long-term aspects if we drove for margin improvement in that time. If we're in a world like we are today, let's say, where all of our operating companies are within 3% or 4% organic growth, then we're quite comfortable we would be able to expand margins on that basis.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. Last one for me is just, Dan, you're going to inherit a pristine balance sheet from Brian. Any thoughts on capital management or change in appetite for buybacks or anything?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, I think that kind of question's a little premature. But I would say that in general, whether we're talking about the actual business strategies or strategies around capital management, you have to bear in mind that our overall leadership group is a closely knit team. And so the strategies that we've developed, it won't be my strategies and it weren't particularly Brian's strategies, this was the team of Marsh & McLennan strategies and I would think you'll see some real consistency over long stretches of time.
Operator: Next we'll go to Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Two questions. Just wondering if you would comment on whether foreign exchange had a larger than normal impact on earnings in the quarter? And then just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the -- that adjustment in the RIS section for the re-measurement of contingent acquisitions and just what went into that?
Brian Duperreault: Sure, sure, sure. FX, all right, well, Michael, that's yours.
J. Michael Bischoff: Thank you. As you can see from what we disclosed, Larry, on the revenue, you can see that overall, the currency impact on revenue was minus 3% for the quarter. But your question was specifically addressed, I think, to how it affected earnings. And I would say there was a slight headwind for us on an earnings side in the quarter, both for Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting, fairly similar to what we had seen in the first and second quarter as well.
Brian Duperreault: Okay. So Mike, why don't you elaborate on the RIS adjustment?
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes. The bulk of the adjustment that we had on contingent considerations was in RIS. I think there's $1 million in our Consulting segment. And Larry, what this really has to do is really what we would view as purchase price adjustments. When we do the acquisitions, predominantly in Marsh & McLennan Agency, but not just for them, it could include other acquisitions. In many cases, we would have earn outs and the earn outs are predicated with regard to what the projections over a 2- or 4-year period may be between us and the sellers with regard to revenue and more importantly, earnings growth and capabilities. And so we put that on our balance sheet at the time of the acquisition and we look at those every quarter to see if the adjustments need to be moved up or down. And we have disclosed that information every quarter. This is the largest adjustment that we've seen. And you can see that this quarter, we made an adjustment essentially of $26 million, the bulk of it in Risk and Insurance Services, just to refine those adjustments. So we view it mainly as a balance sheet item and for that reason, we put it in the adjusted schedules and lay it out, so that every analyst and investor can see the actual impact in the quarter.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: And so is the conclusion that the -- given that this was a positive adjustment, is the conclusion the revenue is not coming in -- the revenue and/or profits are not coming in as originally targeted?
J. Michael Bischoff: That would be the conclusion if you were very specific, but you have to look at the magnitude of the deals that we've done and put this into context. So if you look at the considerations that we have and you're basically looking at deals over a 3-year period, that ballpark are $800 million and in one particular quarter, based upon what the projections maybe going forward over the next 2 or 3 years is in the neighborhood of $25 million, you can see that it's fairly de minimis. And by the way, these adjustments do occur every quarter and they move up and down. Within that, that's aggregate of all the deals that we've had and we've actually had some of the deals that have been exceeding our expectations. So this refinement, you'll see every quarter. We'll present it to you and we're excluding it from our adjusted earnings. I would say, by the way, you're right, it was a positive in the quarter and so it increased GAAP earnings by $0.04 and we felt that probably wasn't appropriate for an adjusted basis.
Operator: And next, we're going to go to Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: First question, Mike, CapEx really popped up in the quarter. Anything unusual in the CapEx line? Is that kind of the run rate we should expect here going forward?
J. Michael Bischoff: Brian, that's a good observation. We noticed it ourselves. It actually occurred in the second quarter as well. It moved up to about $100 million in the second quarter, and $100 million roughly in the third quarter. So we're tracking roughly around $300 million to $350 million of CapEx expenditures. And I think this speaks to what Dan had articulated in his remarks, where we were making investments -- continuing to make investments in our businesses. And over the last 2 quarters, some of that CapEx expenditure was specifically for Mercer. Some of it was specifically at Marsh and some of it was also at the parent company. So that would be a fairly decent run rate, I would think, that you could use, Brian, going forward even though it may move around quarter-to-quarter.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then next question, is it possible to get a sense of what the recent acquisitions over the last 12 months, how they kind of impacted earnings in the quarter and then maybe just what the M&A pipeline looks like?
J. Michael Bischoff: I can say from the standpoint of the acquisition, the impact in the quarter, we do lay that out in our supplemental schedules, and you can see it was 1%. I would also say that, that acquisition disposition schedule also uses adjustments or transfers that we would have between our businesses just to make sure that it's consistent within the operating segments and for the operating companies. So actually, the impact on acquisitions for us in this quarter was fairly de minimis.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So the impact -- okay, great. And then MMA outlook?
Daniel S. Glaser: The pipeline is actually very strong for, really, for both segments. When we look in terms of RIS specifically, it's not just the MMA segment, the Marsh & McLennan Agency, but really, we're well positioned as a leader around the world and we are an attractive buyer to many companies. And so we're -- we have conversations often. We don't do many deals, but we're certainly looking at a lot of things.
Operator: And next, from Barclays, we have Jay Gelb.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: This question is for Alex. On the Guy Carpenter organic revenue growth, should we -- I know that could be depressed in 4Q as well. What are your expectations in terms of the potential uplift as a result of Sandy headed into 2013?
Alexander S. Moczarski: Okay. It's early days at the moment. We've seen a number of estimates ranging from $20 billion for 2012 or to $50 billion as regards the economic or even insured losses. There's enough global capacity for that to be swallowed, so we don't expect to see rates increasing across the globe. If we look at the Northeast, as Brian said, there's going to be some more attention, you would think, to the Northeast, more, both on the modeling side as well as on the underwriting side. And we would expect that it could be tough for an underwriter to say that they're going to reduce rates in the Northeast going forward. So there might be some tailwind there, but globally, we don't expect to see tailwinds.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I see. Okay. And then switching gears to Dan on the Risk and Insurance Services margin. There continues to be sustained improvement there and I'm just wondering if that will help offset some of the headwinds we're seeing in the Consulting businesses, specifically Oliver Wyman.
Daniel S. Glaser: Well, I think in -- if you look at our margin expansion through the year in each of the segments, it's pretty consistent. And we outlined, as part of our strategy, the notion that we thought our Consulting margins, which had really hit a trough right after the Great Recession. So in 2009, they were down to 10.3%, that we were on a path to improve those margins, not only to reach our historical performance levels, but really to optimize the use of our scale and our global footprint to deliver really good Consulting margins. And so we've been on that path: 10.3% in '09; 11.4% in 2010; 11.8% in 2011; and 13.2% year-to-date. And so we don't believe we're getting off of that path, even with what we're seeing today, with some macro weakness affecting Oliver Wyman. So if you put it into context as well in terms of size, Mercer’s quite a bit larger than Oliver Wyman in terms of its impact on the overall Consulting segment. So as we look at -- if we're in a world like we look at today, which is sort of uncertain but grinding it out, we feel that we'll remain on that path of improving margins in both in RIS and our Consulting segment.
J. Michael Bischoff: This is Mike Bischoff. Let me just give a little bit more color to the background of your question and then throw it over to John to elaborate. The environment that we're seeing in Europe, Oliver Wyman has faced actually the last 4 quarters, where we've really seen declines in revenue with regard to their European Consulting practices. What offset that was very strong growth in North America and we continue to see that through the third quarter as well. But I think what John is indicating that, that very strong growth is just going down to very good growth and that with the continuation of what we're seeing with regard to Europe really gets us a little bit more of a balance in the fourth quarter, and not feeling terrible about going into next year, but John?
John P. Drzik: Yes, I think the last couple of years, we've been in a weak recovery environment in North America and pretty much a 0 growth plus or minus environment in Europe. So as we're looking into 2013, we expect to see a broad continuation of that environment. As Mike said, our very rapid growth in the U.S. has tapered a bit in the second half and that's been one of the contributors to the weakening growth overall and we had relatively challenging conditions throughout the year in Europe. And we don't, at this juncture, see those as getting worse, just more of a continuation of that going into next year, but perhaps not offset as much by the strong growth in the U.S. that we had in the first half of the year.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then, Mike, just a separate one. On the tax rate, was it depressed by anything in 3Q and should we use a 30% effective tax rate going forward?
J. Michael Bischoff: No, a very good question. As we look through the first 3 quarters of the last year, the adjusted tax rate was 30%. As we look through, not only this quarter but the year-to-date, the adjusted tax rate was 30%. So it's comparable year-to-year but, Jay, there always is discrete items in every quarter. So modeling going forward, anywhere in the 30% to 31% range, I think is very appropriate for a tax rate.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Two questions. First one, the investment income, that number obviously jumps around, it's very hard to predict. Can you give us any sense of what you would view as a normalized number for that line item?
Brian Duperreault: Michael?
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes, Jay, very good question. I would say that roughly 75% of the investments that we have in that line are tied to Trident II, and Trident II was created as an investment fund back in 1999. It really had a 10-year life and so we're kind of wondering why it still is continuing now into 2012. But if you look at it, and because in Trident II, which we do not control or manage, the main investment that they have is a public company, they have to mark it to market on a quarterly basis. And we pull that on a quarter lag basis into our results, which is thus the movement up and down of their portfolio is what causes the movement up and down in our investment income. To get really to the heart of your question though, you're asking how should you look at it. Our investments in this space are roughly $100 million and you would look in a normalized basis that we should be producing a couple million a quarter out of a real long-term investment strategy. So we would be happy when the volatility ends and when Trident II is basically closed down.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: That's very helpful, Mike. The other one is the adjustments to the acquisition-related accounts, the $25 million. Where is that in the P&L? Where is the adjustment being made?
J. Michael Bischoff: If you look at it from the standpoint -- and by the way, if you want more information on that, we do put it in our financials footnotes. I think it's Footnote 11 and when you see the Q every quarter, you can track and look at it. And essentially, on that fair value measurement, you will see how we go through it and the contingent consideration can include both the consideration that's just deferred and will be paid, as well as the balance sheet adjustments that we make. And because we are doing acquisitions, you'll see additions to that typically every quarter and you'll see payments every quarter and then you'll see the adjustments to fair value. To give you an idea of where that balance is at the end of the third quarter, it's $78 million. So essentially, what we've been dealing with is about $100 million with regard to the results. So it just basically flows through the different segments and the operating income that we have and you would essentially just be reversing the liabilities, so it would flow through, in that regard, through our P&L.
Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: But it's a bunch of different line items, there's no one quick adjustment. So if I wanted adjust your P&L for this quarter based on the information I have for that number, I really couldn't do it.
J. Michael Bischoff: No, Jay, you could. We give out that information every quarter and it is one line and you can see and you can see it by segment. And if you need some help in it, Scott, Douglas or I will give it to you.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I guess I had 2 questions. One was just can you talk a little bit -- I mean, obviously acquisitions are one way of growing your business. Can you talk a little bit about maybe how headcount is changing in the company this year and maybe how much -- especially maybe more on the client facing side and maybe what your plans are in that regard as you look into next year? And then also I'd just be curious, obviously with health care reform and the like, we've had questions on this call about exchanges for a while, but I guess, should we expect to see an announcement from Mercer or the company at large on exchanges anytime soon? And if so, are we more likely to see those coming through on the healthcare side or retirement side or both?
Brian Duperreault: Well, you can expect to hear something from Julio in a minute. But before that occurs, maybe Dan can talk about the headcount.
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. So on an -- first thing about the company on an overall basis, the headcount has been pretty consistent over a long stretch of time. There's been movement in the parts of it as we've gone through early stage restructurings 4 or 5 years ago, which sort of reduced the non-client facing parts of the business and pushed more toward the client and the RIS segment in particular. But if you look over the course of say, 2008, at the end of the year, we were about 54,000 all in, and now we're very close to 54,000 all in. So over many years, we've been pretty consistent on the client side -- on the overall colleague side. Much of our colleague growth has been via acquisitions. So as an example, within Marsh & McLennan Agency, we have about 1,500 people within that. We added 700 or 800 people with the Alexander Forbes acquisition. So ultimately, the headcount growth has largely been around acquisitions as opposed to any kind of organic growth within the headcount.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Is that likely to change anytime soon? Or is that -- we should expect more of the same amount?
Daniel S. Glaser: No, I think you'll see more of the same in that the -- if you factor out acquisitions for a second, you'll find us becoming more and more efficient in how we run our business, but the headcount line staying largely the same because we're taking headcount that we find more efficient ways to run the business and we reallocate that headcount toward the client-facing roles.
Brian Duperreault: Okay. So Julio, exchanges.
Julio A. Portalatin: Thank you, Brian, and thank you, Matthew, for the question. As you know, this is a big topic for the industry and for our business right now. In fact, I just got back from D.C. where we had a chance to host a panel discussion on health care reform, among leading experts and many of them who advise the current administration on health care reform and of course, exchanges in particular. Private exchange is generally considered to be an easy access through a marketplace approach for a better employee choice options and of course, cost control. And we spend a lot of time at our clients educating them on the concept and of course, you see some of the growth that we're seeing in our Health & Benefits line because of some of that extra work that's coming our way as a result of the Affordable Care Act. We have lots of options already that are before our clients that we're actually using to address some of the choice and cost control. One of them is Mercer Health Advantage and that is actually an opportunity for people to participate and for clients to participate with their employees to take advantage of scale and discounts that we give through Mercer Health Advantage. And in fact, we have about 14 employers that are already participating on this. We anticipate to sign up somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 employees and their families through this vehicle that will, of course, go through 2014 and 2013 as well. So Mercer -- we also have Mercer Marsh benefits, which of course is a great way internationally of facing the market to give additional choice options and cost control and we will be announcing soon a partnership in the Medicare retirement space that will also have us actively involved. And I'd like to also mention that it is our full intention to have an active exchange in place for 2013 enrollment. And so as you mentioned earlier, stay tuned as things continue to develop.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. That advantage product, is that -- that's a scale program for multiple employers, but is that one carrier supported?
Julio A. Portalatin: No, it's actually multi-carrier supported and will continue to be an option for those that are looking purely for the discount side, right? There's different types of active exchanges will give different types of affordable options and certainly, the marketplace option is being considered for private exchange would be a little bit more expansive than what we offer Mercer Health Advantage, but nonetheless very attractive. Keep in mind that employees are at different stages of trying to figure out what they're actually going to do with private exchanges. And during this stage, they are very receptive to an option like Mercer Health Advantage, as demonstrated by 14 employers and 400,000 employee and families who are choosing that option.
Operator: Next we'll go to Ray Iardella with Macquarie.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: Just a quick question, I guess, maybe sticking with Julio for a second. I know -- I think Dan, in his prepared remarks, mentioned some growth in Latin America and Asia. Just curious kind of where the growth within Mercer overall, where it's coming from right now relative to the U.S. versus just broadly international. I know you guys don't disclose that, but can you give a sense of the growth trajectory there?
Julio A. Portalatin: Yes, let me comment, if I may, for a second on the third quarter that incorporates some of what you're asking here. We had a pretty solid performance for Mercer in the quarter and so I'm pretty pleased. And even though we've had continued softness, as many have mentioned, in the global economy, we continue to manage tightly our expenses and of course, invest in things that we think are going to give us good growth. And one of the overall objectives, of course, is to continue to become more significant in what we call our growth markets and growth economies because we see them as being able to come out of some of the global challenges a little bit quicker than perhaps some of the mature ones and thus, that's an important emphasis for us. Overall, our underlying growth for the quarter was 3%, it's consistent with what we've been running in the quarter and last quarter and of course, on our year-to-date basis. So as far as revenue, what we disclosed, as you know, is by our line of businesses. And our Health & Benefits business, as I mentioned earlier, is 7% up and Investment's a strong 10% up and those 2 are carrying the day and you can imagine that those 2 are also playing very well in some of the growth economies. So it's not -- it wouldn't be surprising to see that we are really doing very well in our growth economies and well into the double digits, I think, is fair to say. And we continue to want to invest there and see more type of profitable revenue growth from those areas of the world.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: Okay. That's certainly helpful. And then maybe moving on, similar question to Peter, if he's there in the room, just given I guess the organic growth, what we've seen over the past few quarters out of Latin America and Asia, it looked like it slowed down a little bit. I know the comps are getting difficult given the double-digit growth, but how should we think about that going forward?
Peter Zaffino: Thanks, Ray. Overall, for Marsh, we had very strong revenue growth with our renewal book, as stated in opening comments, over $260 million of new business and it was spread out across the world, which is very comforting for us as we look at overall Marsh. One of the things, again, when we look at this globally is number of offensive RFPs we've been competing on is now over 75%. So we're winning a lot of business and that's building the organic growth over several quarters. When we you look at the emerging economies, and so you had said about Latin America, we have to keep in mind it's one their smallest quarters, so any volatility in the renewal line will skew it in terms of its organic growth. They actually did produce more new business year-over-year and we're comfortable with the year-to-date growth rate around 12% and look at the third quarter as not consistent with how we expect them to perform but overall, we're pleased with our growth in Latin America and in Asia.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: And if I can squeeze one more in a similar topic for Mike in terms of cash U.S. versus offshore.
J. Michael Bischoff: That's a very good question. We're actually -- well, let me say that the second half of the year, we have really strong cash generation from our operating companies and you see that reflected in the $2,044,000,000 of cash that we have at the end of the third quarter, and that strong cash flow should continue through the fourth quarter. So what we typically do is start to bring money back that's not permanently invested outside the United States during the third and fourth quarter. So actually, I'm going to defer the answer to your question until we end up in the fourth quarter, and really have a definitive number with regard to how much of our cash is international versus in the U.S. And the reason that we're bringing that cash back into the U.S. over the third and fourth quarter is that you know that we have the dividend payments to shareholders. We have another return of capital in the form of share repurchase. And also, we want to look at the MMA acquisition strategy. So it's really in flux, but we started the year with almost all of our cash in international operations.
Operator: And next we'll go to Arash Soleimani with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Arash Soleimani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Just a couple follow-ups on the exchanges. So I just wanted to confirm, the exchange in 2013, that's going to be an MMC-launched exchange, it's not going to be a partnership with a third party, is that correct?
Julio A. Portalatin: I'm sorry, I could not -- can you repeat the question please?
Arash Soleimani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Yes. The exchange that you mentioned in 2013, that's not going to be a partnership, that's going to be an actual MMC-launched exchange?
Julio A. Portalatin: The -- okay, so there's the Mercer Health Advantage, which I already mentioned, which was already launched, right, and we do have more than one carry on that. And that was the 14 employers and 400,000 individuals, as well as family members that'll have access to that for this enrollment period that we speak of right now. And in addition to that, we will also have a Medicare partnership, so that will be a partnership, Medicare retirement partnership going soon. And then we will have an active exchange, where it'll be our exchange that we will also be announcing in the months to come.
Arash Soleimani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of the active exchange, I guess, what will -- in terms of the economics of that, do you expect that to be, I guess, a more lucrative business model than the traditional health benefits model in terms of switching more to a commission-based model or do you expect it to be pretty similar in terms of the margins?
Julio A. Portalatin: I mean, the -- as you -- in the U.S., which is where particularly this applies, about 50% of our business, a bit more than that is commission, the other is consultancy and quite frankly, the margins there are quite handsome and we consider that to be very consistent with what we expect from the exchange option as well.
Arash Soleimani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, we saw that Aon mentioned that about 44% of their survey, I guess, clients mentioned that they were interested in potentially joining an exchange over the next 5 years. Do you find when talking to your clients that, that number seems in line with what you're seeing or...
Julio A. Portalatin: I think it's ever evolving, quite frankly. I mentioned earlier that I was in D.C. and then we had a significant amount of opportunity to be able to kind of assess that and get a ground view on some of the clients' opinions about that and there are several different points. I think that anything that works in the area of providing increased choice and controlled costs is of great interest to our clients, and it could form many different ways and many different solutions in which one of those are exchanges.
Arash Soleimani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Right. And do you think if the states are able, I think it's 2017, to open the exchanges to large employers, I guess greater than 100 employees, do you think in that situation they could pose a competitive threat or that would not even be an issue whatsoever if they open your doors to those?
Julio A. Portalatin: There's still a significant amount of unknowns as to how that'll all develop. It's kind of early in the game for us to really predict how that's going to turn out. So we'll leave it for the strategy that we have already articulated for the moment based on the opportunities that we see in the short and medium term.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just I know we've talked a little bit about Europe and Oliver Wyman. Just is there a way to look at year-over-year revenue change adjusted for FX in Europe, specifically Oliver Wyman, and just to try to understand kind of what that looks like on a stand-alone?
Brian Duperreault: Well, I don't think we give that information out. So I guess, the answer is no, simple. But I think we've given you a pretty good idea of how we feel about Europe from an Oliver Wyman point of view and it's -- I think it is business as usual going forward into next year. So Dan, do you want to say something?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, I would just want to say that Oliver Wyman is our most fungible business model from a project-colleague engagement standpoint. So say it a different way, slowdowns in Europe can be picked up by opportunities in the United States and we can seamlessly move people to those assignments. So it's a line of -- it's a global line of business structure, so it's much more fungible than our other operating companies.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I see. Are you seeing kind of the pipeline shift geographically to kind of facilitate or drive the resource movement from Europe to other areas?
Brian Duperreault: John?
John P. Drzik: Well, I think that is exactly what has been happening through 2012. And as he highlighted earlier, we've had very strong growth in North America this year and faced weakened conditions in Europe. So as Dan highlights, we have a global capacity model. So we're growing overall in Oliver Wyman, so we moved its Consulting capacity from Europe to the United States to help enable the growth here and also then improve the residual economics of the European business. So overall, we really look at the business on a global basis and we manage our capacity to the global growth of the business and we can deal with variation in regional growth, region by region growth by shifting capacity. So really, Oliver Wyman's economics really follow our global revenue growth more than any bifurcation in the revenue growth by region.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And then just one quick one on the risk side. Can you talk a little bit about in the retail side, with North America exposures and kind of trend there, what are you seeing? I know in the release, you mentioned kind of rate on the reinsurance side, but if you could talk a little about business conditions in North America, specifically on the exposure side and maybe a little comment on the rate as well, that'd be great.
Brian Duperreault: Okay, Peter?
Peter Zaffino: Well, on the U.S. side for Marsh, again, this is the third quarter, we still saw more rate increase probably in several segments. So the property cat continued to start to trend up a little bit. You had professional lines, directors and officers focused on financial institutions started to move up. When you look at other segments like casualty, you need to break them down into different buckets, but for umbrella and lead layer casualty, we still saw some pressure on pricing. When you look at in its entirety, more of our clients experience rate increases than decreases in the third quarter when compared to the second quarter. So it was a modest increase but the trend was slightly up. In terms of the exposures, if you looked at payroll, sales, total insured values, I would say low single digits. Generally speaking, we started to see some more activity and increased payroll and start to see a little bit more in TIV, sales was modestly up, but it was low single digits.
Brian Duperreault: Okay. I think we got time for one question if there is one. Anybody?
Operator: Actually, I show we have no further questions.
Brian Duperreault: Well then, that's perfect. All right, well, I think I'm just going to say goodbye.
Operator: That concludes today's conference and we thank you for participating.

Operator: Welcome to the Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Second quarter 2012 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on Marsh & McLennan Companies' website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. In particular, references during this conference call to anticipated or expected results of operations for 2012 or subsequent periods are forward-looking statements, and Marsh & McLennan Companies' actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. Please refer to Marsh & McLennan Companies' most recent SEC filings, as well as the company's earnings release, which are available on the Marsh & McLennan Companies' website, for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn this over to Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Please go ahead, sir.
Brian Duperreault: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our results as reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and COO; and Mike Bischoff, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Following my comments, Dan and Mike will discuss our operating results and financial position in more detail. Our second quarter results were excellent and indicate our continuing progress in establishing Marsh & McLennan Companies as an elite enterprise. Across all our operating companies, we generated revenue growth and higher levels of profitability. In the second quarter, underlying revenue growth was 5%. Combined with ongoing control of expenses and effective capital management, we produced growth in adjusted operating income of 13% and earnings per share of 22%, an outstanding performance. Marsh produced another strong quarter. All major geographies contributed to revenue growth of 6%, driven primarily by new business development. Guy Carpenter produced underlying revenue growth of 10%, led by its international operations. The Consulting segment delivered strong underlying revenue growth in the second quarter. Importantly, Consulting adjusted operating income increased 40%, reflecting strong performance of both Mercer and Oliver Wyman. When we established our long-term performance targets 2 years ago, we understood the challenge and the level of commitment required since very few companies our size have been able to produce double-digit earnings growth over the long term. Since we announced these goals, Marsh & McLennan has been successfully meeting these long-term earnings targets. While we may not achieve double-digit earnings growth every year, we remain confident that we can produce this level of growth over the long term. We understand that to achieve these goals, we need to continuously improve performance through investments in our business, our technology and our colleagues and to make decisions that will enhance long-term growth. This ensures that we will be conducting our business in a way that provides value to our clients, stimulates and rewards our colleagues and delivers consistently strong returns to our shareholders. So in closing, we're very pleased with the second quarter and the results we have produced in the first half of this year. With that, let me turn it over to Dan to review our second quarter results.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, Marsh & McLennan Companies continued to produce excellent financial results. For the eighth consecutive quarter, we achieved underlying revenue growth at each of our operating companies. Risk and Insurance Services revenue was up 5%, with underlying growth of 6%. Adjusted operating income rose 14%, and the adjusted operating margin improved 200 basis points. The double-digit growth in profitability and the margin improvement reflect the exceptional performance of both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. For the 6 months, we achieved 110 basis points of margin improvement. At the same time we produced these results, we continued to make significant investments to enhance client service, improve efficiencies and strengthen our competitive position. Marsh produced another strong quarter. Underlying revenue rose 6%, with all geographies contributing. Latin America increased revenue 14%. Asia Pacific grew 10%. EMEA grew 5%, and the U.S./Canada division rose 4%. Marsh's revenue growth reflects $281 million of new business in the second quarter. This is the strongest quarter of new business in Marsh's history. Guy Carpenter also produced strong results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 7%, and underlying revenue growth was 10%, driven by growth across its international operations, including global specialties, Asia Pacific, EMEA and Latin America. This now extends the trend of Guy Carpenter producing underlying revenue growth for 14 consecutive quarters. As we look at current conditions in the reinsurance marketplace, with July renewal pricing showing signs of stabilization for property catastrophe coverage and risk retentions by several of Guy Carpenter's key clients increasing, we expect only modest revenue growth in the second half of the year for Guy Carpenter. Turning to our Consulting segment. Revenue was $1.3 billion, with 4% underlying revenue growth. Our second quarter results show that we continue to make progress in increasing profitability, as both Mercer and Oliver Wyman contributed to the segment's double-digit growth in earnings and a significantly higher operating margin. Adjusted operating income rose 14% to $176 million, the highest level of quarterly Consulting earnings in our history. The adjusted operating margin increased 140 basis points to 13.1%. For the 6 months, adjusted operating income grew 18% and the adjusted margin rose 160 basis points to 12.7%. Mercer's second quarter underlying revenue growth was 3%. Results reflect increased revenue across all regions, with strong growth in Asia and Latin America. Looking at Mercer's underlying revenue by line of business: Investments grew 7%; Health & Benefits increased 6%; while Retirement, Outsourcing and Talent, Rewards & Communications grew modestly. Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth was 8% in the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in the North American region in the consumer and health and life sciences sectors. Based upon current market conditions, Oliver Wyman expects only modest underlying revenue growth in the third quarter. In conclusion, we are very pleased with the results our operating companies produced in the second quarter. With that, let me turn it over to Mike.
J. Michael Bischoff: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Consolidated revenue was $3 billion in the second quarter, with an increase of 5% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income rose 13%, and the adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points to 17.3%. Earnings per share from continuing operations increased 20% to $0.60 on a GAAP basis. Adjusted earnings per share grew 22% to $0.61. This is notable given weak economic conditions, low interest rates, foreign exchange headwinds and the ongoing investments we are making and continue to make in our businesses. Interest expense was $45 million in the second quarter compared with $49 million last year. The only debt maturity we have over the next 2 years is the $250 million senior note in February 2013. As we discussed last earnings call, our corporate expense this quarter is higher than normal. This is primarily the result of accelerated amortization of senior ex equity awards. This will that be an issue for the remainder of the year. Investment income this quarter was $4 million compared with a loss of $6 million in last year's second quarter. In the third quarter, we anticipate reporting an investment loss of approximately $5 million. Now turning to capital management. Our cash position at the end of June was $1.5 billion. In deploying our excess cash this quarter, we used approximately $70 million for acquisitions and $100 million to repurchase 3.1 million shares, and this was primarily to offset the effects of equity grants. Since December of 2010, we have repurchased 18.7 million shares for approximately $550 million, with $450 million remaining under our current board authorization. Another major use of cash in the quarter was $121 million for dividends. With the continuing European financial crisis, we wanted to give you an idea of the magnitude of Marsh & McLennan's European revenue and how conditions are affecting the results of each of our operating companies. As you're aware, we breakdown Marsh's revenue on a geographic basis, and you can see, for both the second quarter and the year-to-date, that Marsh's revenue growth on an underlying basis in EMEA was 5%. But we wanted to give you a little bit more richer detail with regard to our European position and revenue. So in total, the company generates about $12 billion of annual revenue, with approximately 1/3 of this coming from Europe. Our U.K. operations, which represent approximately 1/2 of our European revenue, continues to perform well. Now let's look at our recent results. Of Marsh's $5.4 billion in annual revenue, approximately 1/3 is in Europe, with 45% coming from the United Kingdom. Marsh's revenue in the U.K. rose 6% for the second quarter and the first half of the year. New business production was particularly robust in the U.K. in the second quarter. For continental Europe, Marsh's revenue grew 4% in the quarter and 3% for the first half of this year. About 1/3 of Guy Carpenter's $1.1 billion in annual revenue is generated in Europe, and the U.K. accounts for more than 75% of this revenue. And Guy Carpenter's U.K. revenue rose double-digits for both the second quarter and the first half of this year, driven by its global specialties. Continental European revenue growth was modest in the quarter and year-to-date for Carpenter. Now turning to our Consulting segment. Mercer's European revenue over the past year was $1.1 billion or about 30% of Mercer's global revenue. The U.K. represents just over 1/2 of Mercer's European revenue, with low single-digit growth for both the first and second quarters. This was true as well for Mercer in Continental Europe. So even though European economic conditions have been difficult, 3 of our 4 operating companies have continued to generate revenue growth in Europe. Oliver Wyman has the greatest exposure to Europe, with approximately 40% of its revenue coming from European clients. Over the past 3 quarters, Oliver Wyman has experienced modest revenue declines in this region. But as you can see from our second quarter earnings release, Oliver Wyman has produced excellent overall results in spite of the continuing weakness in Europe. With that, I am happy to turn it back to Brian.
Brian Duperreault: Thank you, Mike. Operator, I think we can start our question-and-answer period.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And I'll take our first question from Keith Walsh with Citi.
Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I guess the only thing, if I want to nitpick, the plus 4% in the U.S., which is down a little bit, but still better than your peers. If maybe you could talk to that. And in the context of your new business comment, either Dan or Peter, what are you guys doing? Is it more how well your clients are recovering in the large case part of the market versus the smaller end of the market? Or is it new, new business? You're actually going out and winning accounts, if you could talk to that. And then I've got a follow-up for Julio.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. So Peter, do the 4% U.S.
Peter Zaffino: Yes. Overall -- again, when we report the U.S., there's several segments that are within the U.S. and Canada division. We're very pleased with the growth that we've seen in the core U.S. brokerage business. And the trends have been very steady from quarter-to-quarter and expect that to continue through the rest of 2012. To answer your question in terms of -- I think what you're asking, Keith, around the overall growth is, we've had very strong client retention across the world, we've had very strong rollover from new business last year. We have had record new business in the second quarter, which has grown around 10% year-over-year. We're executing on our initiatives. There's been less of a headwind in pricing in 2011 in the second quarter, there were headwinds. We're seeing some slight uptick, certainly, in property and other lines of business that are a little bit distressed, so I look at excess casualty and some workers compensation. So that's affected the U.S. And overall, as Dan said in his comments, we've grown in every part of the world, so we have a nice balance. And when you've done all of those things together, you get good organic growth.
Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then for Julio, the improvement at Mercer, we can see it already. You guys did a nice job, given us some of the European sensitivity there. But can you just give us an idea, what's the plan to protect margins against potential declines in Europe as we head into 2013?
Julio A. Portalatin: Yes, sure, sure, sure. Thanks, Keith. First, I want to say that I'm pretty optimistic about Mercer's profitable growth prospects moving forward. Any business where you are in a mission to promote the health, wealth and performance of companies' best assets, which is, of course, their employees, I think puts you in a good position for the future. So you add Mercer's global footprint, its innovative added-value solutions, and I think we're in good shape. But as you look at calibrating and always looking at what our revenue growth is going to be across the world, we see opportunities that are popping up in different places. Europe might be slowing down, but we have a good business in other places, like in the emerging market world. We want to, obviously, have even more footprint there as time goes on, and I think that's going to really give us some good uplift in the future. Additionally, again, keep in mind that we have some businesses that perform very well in down times and others that don't. And 70% of our business is annuitized; 30%, of course, is program- or project-oriented business. And as we continue to flip that and get more of the annuitized business and less of the project business, I think you'll see that we'll be able to continue to calibrate growth pretty well in the future. Now that said, any time that we're looking to make sure that our margins continue to expand, we have to be very disciplined on the expense side. We continue to do that, and we'll always make sure that, that is calibrated appropriately to what our revenue expectations are.
Operator: We'll move on to Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Could you speak generally to the impact of currency in the quarter 2 results? And then also, do you happen to have the GAAP pension expenses running to the results in the quarter?
Brian Duperreault: Michael?
J. Michael Bischoff: Yes, thank you. If you look at foreign exchange, you can see on our earnings release that the currency impact was about 3% negative with regard to revenue. That indicates that we're converting most of our major currencies: the pound, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar into a stronger dollar. And as a result, not only did it have a negative impact on revenue, but it had a modest negative impact on our operating income, shared equally between Insurance Services and Consulting.
Brian Duperreault: There was a question on...
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Just pension expense.
J. Michael Bischoff: With regards to pension expense, as we indicated at the beginning of the year, gross pension expense would be about $30 million higher for the entire year, and gross impact would be in the low- to mid-20s. And that, obviously, is equal over the course of the year. So in this particular quarter, pension expense -- when we file our 10-Q, gross pension expense, we show about $9 million more than it did in the second quarter of last year.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. And just one additional question. With regard to Consulting margins, can you talk about how much Mercer versus Oliver Wyman is driving margin improvement? Are both of those driving margin expansion? Then, on the Oliver Wyman piece, to the extent that you're seeing a revenue slowdown there, are there levers to continue to push margin improvement?
J. Michael Bischoff: Okay Dan, I'll answer the first question, which is that both of the components of the Consulting segment are driving good margin improvements, so it's across the board. But John, do you want to comment anything on Oliver Wyman?
John P. Drzik: Sure. Well, on Oliver Wyman margins, I'd make -- I'd divide your question into 2 parts. So one is if we experience revenue weakness in one geography, as you are, for example, in Europe now, it doesn't really affect our overall margin because we run our capacity on a global basis. So for example, in the first half of this year, a lot of our people who are based in Europe would have been deployed in the United States or other geographies where growth was stronger. So what really affects -- would affect our margin is aggregate global revenue weakness rather than weakness in any particular geography. And when -- and we have levers to pull in those scenarios as well. So as long as the revenue pattern is a modest decline, we have disciplined compensation programs in place that reacts with respect to revenue decline, so there shouldn't be a substantial margin decline.
Operator: That will come from Morgan Stanley, Greg Locraft.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Wanted to just go back to Europe because it is a big concern in some subset of the investment community out there. And I guess, what you've highlighted is that it's really 15% of revs that are at risk. And I guess, is there a decline in that 15% of the business that would jeopardize your double-digit operating income growth goal?
J. Michael Bischoff: Well, let me try this, Greg. I think when we outlined -- decided to outline Europe, we wanted to show that it's too simplistic to say 1/3 of our business comes from Europe because Europe is an interesting, diverse area, and a large portion of that's coming out of the U.K. And so you have to -- if you're trying to decide the impact of Europe, you have to first understand how the business is spread around and not just geographically, but by component, by our operating companies and segments because the Insurance business acts differently than Consulting, certainly, in recession periods. So there's much more continuing revenue that gives us a ballast against economic changes. So I wouldn't say it's 15% at risk. I mean, everything is at risk. But I think what we're trying to point out is, we have, I think, the last 12 months or so, been experiencing issues in Europe and still, have been able to handle that. We believe we can continue to handle that going forward. And I think, as John said, unless it's some overall, complete meltdown of the global economy, we feel comfortable of that exposure. So I think Dan also wants to add something.
Daniel S. Glaser: I'll just say a couple of things. One, even if you go back 5 years ago or so, Europe, continental Europe was not a high-growth area for us. So it was a low to mid single-digit growth area, and it's remained pretty much a low and single-digit growth area. Our global network really benefits us quite a bit because while European companies might not be doing all that well in Europe, they are doing as anybody else on -- with their multinational footprint. So we're working on French companies around the world, Spanish companies around the world, and you often hear a refrain when you visit these companies about how they're not doing well in their local market, but they're doing quite well outside of their local market.
Brian Duperreault: Okay, Greg?
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, good. And then any quick updates on the CFO search process that's under way?
Brian Duperreault: Well, thanks for asking that question because it gives me the opportunity to thank Mike who's done a terrific job and continues to do a terrific job as our CFO. So yes, we're still -- we're in the interview phase. So things are progressing nicely. I feel very good about the process, and I don't think I'll say anything more than that.
Operator: Next question will come from Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: With total organic revenue growth in 2Q of 5% and the company facing some comparison headwinds in Guy Carpenter and Oliver Wyman on the organic revenue growth front, what should we be thinking about in terms of overall organic revenue growth in sort of the back half?
J. Michael Bischoff: Well, what we've told you is 2 of the operating companies who had pretty good results, 7% and 10%, they're not going to have those numbers in the second half. We're not saying anything about the other 2, and there's a balance to everything. And I don't live and die on the pure organic growth number. It's managing your growth and your revenue and expense through the ups and downs, the cyclicality, seasonal cyclicality where the third quarter isn't that strong for Marsh. But we don't expect that we would have issues with respect to our bottom line, and we think we'll close out the year well. We have a goal of double digit. I firmly believe that, that's a goal that we can achieve. And so we're not -- I'm not just -- we're not talking about the rest of the organic growth, but the fact that we have a goal to make a bottom line, and we believe we can do that.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then on the -- in the Consulting segment, with the 13% margin in the second quarter, clearly, an improvement versus a year ago. Should we expect continued improvement in the second half on the Consulting margin?
J. Michael Bischoff: Well, again, I want to reinforce that our goals have been a growth in our operating income, growth in earnings per share. I'm -- I don't -- so each of the operating companies, each of the segments, they have -- they know what they need to do. They know what the kind of growth requirements we have, and so with respect to Consulting, John and Julio know what's expected of them. And so we would expect that they'll manage through this year and the next accordingly, that may produce good margin improvements. But the important thing for us is they produce those double-digit growth in earnings.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then on share buyback that sort of resumed in the second quarter after, I believe, no buybacks for the prior 2 quarters, what's your outlook there?
Brian Duperreault: Well, our policy about that is that we will buy back shares through capital management, if we don't have alternative uses of that cash, basically for acquisition. So we would prefer acquisitions, I would anyway, because I think it's more accretive long term. We have the minimum that we would buy back shares so that we don't dilute with our compensation issues. But past that, I think it's more what opportunities present themselves, and actually, I prefer that those opportunities come in the form of acquisitions. But if not, then we would increase our share repurchasing.
Operator: Moving on to Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I'd like to follow up on that, if I can. Does the turmoil in Europe present any increased opportunity on the M&A front?
Brian Duperreault: Well, that's an interesting question because that's -- usually, the source of great opportunity is when there's trouble. And so yes, I guess, that's a possibility. I'm not signaling anything here but yes, certainly, a possibility. But we've -- our acquisition approach has been more targeted to areas where we want to fill out that we're not as robust as we need to be. That could be geographically, also in capabilities. And so if those opportunities emerge in Europe, they'll have to get in line and meet the criteria that the other ones are meeting or exceeding. So -- but yes, certainly, that's a real possibility.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And just to clarify something. If you've got a Spanish client that's doing well in Latin America, sort of their subsidiary, does that revenue growth show up in EMEA or Latin America for you?
Brian Duperreault: That would show up in Latin America.
Operator: Moving on to Ray Iardella with Macquarie.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: So I guess maybe for Peter. Thinking about the new business growth in Marsh and the record quarter that you guys had, is there anything in particular you guys are doing on that side to drive that growth? Any new products or anything you can talk to?
Peter Zaffino: Well, thanks Ray for the question. Certainly, the first and foremost is execution. We have a very strong pipeline, strong coverage on our global sales. We introduced, years ago, something called Marsh 3D, which is define, design and deliver, and that really takes us through a thorough risk management approach in making sure that we're assessing every opportunity. We've had a strong focus on growing share of wallet, connecting our multinational network and where we can grow market share from clients that we already have. And taking advantage of being a global organization. We behave as one firm, and there's great opportunities to collaborate and bring the strength of the organization together. The investments that have been made over the years in terms of industry and specialty expertise, there's a flight to quality. When it's more difficult to place business in a very challenging market, we've seen an uptick as a result of that. And we're having more robust discussions around analytics and how we can be more thoughtful in terms of recommendations around volatility. We expanded our own analytical platform to be able to do more stochastic modeling, do more cap modeling on the larger accounts. So that has given us opportunities for growth as well.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: Okay. That's helpful. And then one quick numbers question, I guess, for Mike. Just to confirm, the operating income had a negative impact from FX on -- in both segments?
J. Michael Bischoff: That's correct.
Operator: From Langen McAlenney, Larry Greenberg.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: I was just wondering if you could quantify or give us some order of magnitude the impact of pricing underlying commercial lines pricing on your revenue growth.
Brian Duperreault: Peter?
Peter Zaffino: Yes. Pricing, again, it's a long answer if we went segment by segment. I won't do that. But you do have to look at geography, line of business, each of the segments and then look at the year-over-year performance. When you start to take a look at what's the line affected most, it's property. So world peak zones, cat exposed, loss impacted business have seen the biggest rates. In the U.S., property is the one that stands out. 60% of our clients saw a rate increase, but 40% saw either no increase or were modestly down. You have to look at total insured values. Those are starting to move, again, very modestly. Excess -- I mentioned before, excess umbrella and lead D&O pricing is starting to move modestly, but the excess layers are still very competitive. And then workers' comp in the U.S., based on the pressure of the accident years, we've seen that go up in the mid-single digits. You have to shift overlooking into the international. EMEA and Asia Pac, generally speaking, if you take the peak zones out, pricing was flat to down. And we feel the same way about Latin America, where pricing conditions were predominantly slightly down. When you take all that together and look at the overall index that we have published with our top 20 countries with the top lines of business that I just covered, we've seen around a 1.4% increase in price. So I think that's had a modest impact in the overall 6%. But I'm not going to give a specific as to what that contributed. But again, I said, in 2011, it was a headwind, and it's a modest help in 2012.
Brian Duperreault: Alex, do you want to -- I was going to answer, Peter, by the way. Alex, do you want to add to that?
Alexander S. Moczarski: I won't be as expansive as Peter. Essentially, we calculate -- the effects on our results were about 2 to 2.5 points in the second quarter. And that effect is diminishing since it's a pretty benign year compared to the first 6 months of last year. And obviously, we're in the windstorm season, so we don't know how that will play out. But yes, we'll take the points, and we'll see what happens in the second half of the year.
Operator: That will come from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Could you touch on whether the operating strategy within Health & Benefits is evolving in light of the Supreme Court decision, including whether Marsh will move forward with the health care exchange initiative, as, I believe, some of your competitors appear to be doing?
Brian Duperreault: Yes. Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin: Thanks. Thank you for the question. We could talk for a long time about this topic because it's obviously a very appropriate discussion these days. But first, let me just level set a little bit. Health care reform requires the states set up their own health exchanges or partner with or use the to-be-created federally facilitated exchange. To date, there's been about 16 states that have indicated that they will create their own exchanges, 7 have said that they will not and another 16 are still studying their options. The remaining states appear to have taken kind of a "let's wait and see" or "no significant activity" approach. States have to submit a blueprint to the federal government by mid-November if they want to move forward with an exchange by 2012. Otherwise, the federal government steps in. So establishing these exchanges is a very complex undertaking for the federal government, as well as it is for states. And they need a lot of help and assistance, and that's where Mercer's coming in. And a lot of individual subsidies and employee penalties are subject to if, in fact, you don't move forward with the degree of pace as outlined in my earlier comment. Our primary role in all of this has been to provide expertise and advice to states on developing their perspectives and helping design their strategies. So far, we've worked with several states, and we expect additional work with those and more over the coming months. We're also spending a lot of time helping our corporate clients understand and prepare for these regulations. We're working with our employer clients as they manage through the complex reform, provide advice and solutions, and we're partnering with carriers as well on new products that can help employers lower the cost of health care through the use of high-quality networks and customized care management. One offering, in particular, is the Mercer Health Advantage, which is getting good response in the market, and we expect to have about 500,000 enrolled -- employees enrolled in this and similar plans for 2013. So this whole area is evolving very quickly, it's exciting. I think Mercer is well positioned to play a leadership role in the evolution of it. I also want to add one more note that we've launched most recently, the Mercer Marsh solution, which brings both the added-value, client-facing solutions for the market of both Mercer and Marsh. And that's moving quite nicely as well.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I mean, would you say, to a certain extent, that Marsh is taking a "let's wait and see" approach just because there's a lot changing?
Julio A. Portalatin: In terms of exchanges, you're referring to?
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Correct.
Julio A. Portalatin: I wouldn't say wait and see. I would say, be part of the solution and move forward, and that's the approach I would like to take with this. I think we have to make sure that we calibrate the opportunity with the investment necessary to take advantage of the opportunity as time goes on. And I think we're doing that quite well right now.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And lastly, a follow-up to Jay Gelb's earlier question. Could we get an update on what type of M&A opportunities Marsh is most focused on? And Brian, I recall last quarter you mentioned adding components and capabilities that Marsh didn't have. I'd be interested in what those capabilities would be.
Brian Duperreault: Well, first of all, we're -- the M&A activity, I guess begins with the Marsh agency. We've been spending a lot of time on that. And I think we have about $70 million spend in the quarter. Some of that was agency, some of that was continuing to spend for the African acquisition that we made. So there -- Marsh is getting its fair share of this to expand both its capabilities in the U.S. and geographically. We didn't have anything else in the quarter for the other operating companies. But what we've done typically is, say, in Oliver Wyman, finding a segment. I mean, our life sciences segment, which is growing dramatically now, really started a few years ago with the acquisition. And so trying to find a group of people who have the capability in an area that we're not as strong in would be a typical acquisition on Oliver Wyman. And I think you would continue to see that going forward. In Julio's case, well, there's -- I could pick a number of things. I mean, we've got a number of segments that he has, that whether it's investments where we've made investments in the past to fill that out or it could be geography, too. It's hard to be specific, because if I had one, I could tell you about it. So you just have to take the general comment that it's filling in areas that we feel we need to fill in.
Operator: We'll move on to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Two questions. The first is, I didn't quite catch this, when you talked about Oliver Wyman in the second half having more modest growth, what was the rationale behind that?
Brian Duperreault: John?
John P. Drzik: So Jay, I think there's 2 reasons for it. First, we're expecting the weaker economic conditions in Europe to continue. So as we mentioned, we're experiencing a revenue -- have been experiencing a revenue decline in Europe in the first half of the year, and we expect that weakness to continue into the second half. Now on the first half of the year, that was offset by very strong growth in the U.S. market, and we're expecting that growth to taper a bit, so therefore, the overall growth rate would come down, say, from the 7% in the first half to something in the low-single digits for the second half, and it's principally that. There is a second reason which has a modest effect, which is, in the Q1 call, we explained that we have timing of revenue from contracts with acceptance provisions that occurred earlier this year, and this boosted our Q1 growth but will actually lower our second half growth, particularly in Q4. So that's the second effect.
Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: That's very helpful. And then secondly, I guess related to Europe, my recollection is a lot of the European business -- as I recall, I think it is in Marsh -- gets done early in the year and maybe that's true with Consulting as well, I'm not sure. As you're looking out towards the first half of 2013, given the environment which doesn't feel like it's getting much better over there, is that the bigger risk when you look in the first half of '13?
Brian Duperreault: Let me start, and then I think you guys could fill in. But yes, the insurance is sort of front-end loaded in the year, early part of the year. That's not the case in Consulting, which is spread much more evenly throughout the year. We've pointed out that Marsh had pretty good results, certainly, in the first half of this year, both in the continent and in the U.K. And so I would say we're not overly concerned about the renewal season.
Daniel S. Glaser: There's a few things. There's a lot that goes into what organic revenue looks like in all geographies, but in particular, in Europe. So you have to first start with, "Okay, what's going on with GDP? And is the economy growing? Are exposure units growing?" And then you would say, "Well, what's happening with regard to rate? What's happening with regard to client retention? What's happening with regard to negotiations with carriers over commission yields? And then what's going on with new business?" So there's a number of factors that are at work that you aggregate them together and come up with your organic growth number. I mean, we think -- there's a few things, particularly on the insurance side. Companies in Europe will continue to buy insurance as of January 1, and that can be the announcement. So Europe is -- while they're in difficult times, in some ways, having insurance protection with quality carriers and a top-quality intermediary is more important than when times are buoyant.
Brian Duperreault: Okay, Jay?
Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes. I appreciate that.
Operator: That will come from Adam Klauber with William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Margin expansion in Risk and Insurance Services was better in the second quarter than it had been in the last couple of quarters. Is that partially attributable to strong growth at Guy Carpenter? And what else is driving that?
Brian Duperreault: Dan, why don't you do that?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. We're talking about margins in general. As Brian pointed out earlier, our first focus is growth and growth of actual profit, our earnings and looking to do that on a double-digit basis in more years than we don't. And then we also, obviously, look at margins. So it's kind of like organic growth, earnings and then margins. And when we look at margins, we start with both segments, not just the RIS segment, and we're -- our expectation is, over the next several years, we will improve margins in both of our segments. And we'll do that for a variety of different ways, but most specifically, by calibrating expense growth with revenue growth and being very alive to what's happening on revenue week by week and month by month in calibrating our expenses accordingly. When we look at our RIS, as we mentioned in the first quarter, we're making a lot of investments. Those are not quarter by quarter as being perfectly timed, so you see some level of ebb and flow on the cost of investments that roll through and the cost of strategic recruitment, et cetera. And so that all is playing itself out. Overall, we think our margins in RIS are strong; I think, through 6 months, may even be market-leading. But on the basis, we do believe we will improve them over time. And -- but I wouldn't read into this quarter versus last quarter, because we don't manage our business that way. As we've described about Consulting in the past, we expect more out of the margins in Consulting over time because the margins in Consulting through the recession had gotten lower than they've historically been. So we are on a path back to our historical performance.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: One follow-up. The growth in the U.K. was clearly strong, but the U.K. has been slowing down economically in the last 6 months or so. Are you a bit worried about that?
Brian Duperreault: Well, there's a couple of things about the U.K. A very significant chunk of our business in the U.K. on the RIS side is global business that comes to the U.S -- to the U.K. for placement. And so that's really a global phenomena, as opposed to U.K. only. When you're looking at U.K. only in specific, you're really looking, more often, on the RIS side as Marsh's retail business. And that's actually been performing well. You're very right to point out that the U.K, like a lot of places in the world, are struggling with overall growth. We have not seen that affect us to date, but we're very watchful and mindful of that.
Operator: And that will come from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Couple of questions. Retirement, Health & Benefits were flat over the first quarter. But Outsourcing year-over-year slowed, and Talent slowed. I'm just trying to understand kind of what happened there and how should we think about that. And just one follow-up.
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes. On the Outsourcing front, you may have recalled, in the last quarter, I talked about us benefiting from some of the year-on-year comparisons in the first quarter because of business that had been secured the year before. And I think in the second quarter, we felt a more year-on-year likely comparison, I guess, between last year and this year. And we see Outsourcing continuing to be a support for our core businesses, and we'll continue to manage it that way as we go forward. I think what you see as far as growth pattern is very much within expectations.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then on the Talent side?
Daniel S. Glaser: Talent is being impacted, of course, mostly from the discretionary side of the project work that we do. There is a proportion of our business in the talent world that, obviously, is project-oriented and very much related to how corporations and clients are spending and their spending behaviors. And certainly, Europe would be one of those places where we've seen a bit of a slowdown on the discretionary projects. We -- on the opposite end of that, we've seen some good revenue growth in other parts of the world that's offsetting a bit of that challenge. But that's some of the headwinds that we're seeing, and we hope that, that will continue to recover as time in the year goes on.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And then just one -- I'm sorry, if I could, one more. Brian, is that okay?
Brian Duperreault: Yes, please go ahead, yes. I was going to ask you to.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then Oliver Wyman, you kind of talked about. It sounds like the driver of the expectations for slower growth on the back half of the year are not Europe, actually, it's the U.S. and what may be happening there. I guess, my question is, what's happening outside of the U.S. and Europe in terms of Oliver Wyman? And how is that part of the world and part of the business doing? And within the U.S., what exactly drove other than these contracts that you maybe talked about in the last Q and just mentioned briefly here? What else happened to cause that spike in activity?
Brian Duperreault: Okay, John.
John P. Drzik: Yes. So let me take the U.S. part, first. I mean, the fastest-growing segments we had in the business in the U.S. and globally were our health care business and consumer business, so that accounted for the spike. Now those businesses jumped up quite a bit in the first half of the year, so it's not that we're projecting adverse conditions for the U.S., it's more that we don't expect the growth to offset as much as it did the European growth. So we still expect to grow in the U.S. in the second half of the year and grow at quite a healthy pace, but probably, not at quite the same rate as in the first half. But it was driven by health care and consumer, principally in the U.S. In terms of outside the U.S., in Europe, about 15% to 20% of our business falls into that category, and it's been sort of a mix of different outcomes in different regions. Our business isn't large enough in any one region to say decisively. It had -- certain regions have been growing faster over a long period time. If you look just at 2012, which is perhaps your question, we've been growing better in the Middle East, in Brazil, in Russia and not as strongly in Asia. So that's been this year's pattern. But again, the businesses aren't large enough that the pattern changes from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
Brian Duperreault: So let me close this by saying that we had, as I said earlier, an excellent quarter, and we couldn't have that without the hard work of our 53,000 colleagues. So let me take this opportunity to thank them for their great work and also, thank all of you on the phone for your interest in Marsh & McLennan. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. Have a great day.

Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. First quarter 2012 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on Marsh & McLennan Companies' website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. In particular, references during this conference call to anticipated or expected results of operations for 2012 or subsequent periods are forward-looking statements and Marsh & McLennan Companies' actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. Please refer to Marsh & McLennan Companies' most recent SEC filings as well as the company's earnings release, which are available on the Marsh & McLennan Companies' website, for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today.  I'll now turn this over to Mr. Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Brian Duperreault: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our results as reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and COO; and Mike Bischoff, our CFO.  Before I continue, I'd like to thank Mike for serving as CFO as we search for a permanent replacement. With Mike's vast knowledge and experience, we have not missed a beat.  Also I'd like to welcome 3 of our operating companies' CEOs: Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Unfortunately, Peter Zaffino of Marsh could not be with us today due to a death in his family.  Following my comments, Dan will discuss our operating results in more detail. Mike will then update you on our financial position.  Our strong first quarter results are a terrific start to the year. Across all our businesses, we saw revenue growth and higher levels of profitability. Underlying revenue growth of 6%, combined with ongoing control of expenses, resulted in growth of 12% in adjusted operating income and 13% growth in adjusted earnings per share. This performance is consistent with our long-term plan to produce double-digit earnings growth.  Risk and Insurance Services had an excellent revenue growth. Revenue increased 7% on both a reported and underlying basis.  Marsh produced another strong quarter, generating underlying revenue growth of 7% with all major geographies contributing. This growth was driven by both higher client retention, revenue retention rates and new business development. Guy Carpenter also produced 7% underlying revenue growth, driven by its international operations.  The Consulting segment delivered excellent performance in the quarter as well, producing solid revenue growth on both a reported and underlying basis. Mercer generated underlying revenue growth of 4% and Oliver Wyman's growth was 6%. Importantly, Consulting's adjusted operating income increased 24%, reflecting double-digit growth at both Mercer and Oliver Wyman.  We're pleased with our first quarter results. Our performance demonstrates that we are fulfilling the strategic priority of generating consistent long-term growth in both revenue and earnings that we articulated at Investor Day some 20 months ago. Our long-term growth allows us to continuously improve performance while investing back in our businesses to enhance our competitive position. These investments include value-added products and technology for clients, cutting-edge analytical capabilities and innovative processes, which allow us to become more efficient.  Even more important, as a professional services firm, growth allows us to invest in our colleagues, the foundation of our success. As we grow the company, the opportunities for our colleagues grow as well. The work becomes more intellectually stimulating, the environment more vibrant and there's pride in working for the company. And as our strong performance continues, growth becomes a virtuous circle that builds on itself. Growth becomes a powerful force that's good for clients, good for colleagues and good for our shareholders. It's an exciting place to be.  And with that, let me turn it over to Dan to review our first quarter results.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, Marsh & McLennan's excellent performance continued. We generated significant growth in underlying revenues, which, combined with effective expense control, produced double-digit growth in both adjusted operating income and earnings per share. The first quarter sets the stage for the rest of the year, so we are pleased that each of our operating companies generated strong results and are off to a good start.  Risk and Insurance Services revenue increased 7%, a very strong performance. In fact, 7% is the highest underlying revenue growth rate we have generated in a decade. Profitability increased at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Adjusted operating income increased to $415 million and the adjusted operating margin for the segment improved 40 basis points in the first quarter.  As I've said in the past, we are continuously investing in our businesses. We seek high-value initiatives that support growth and have effectiveness and efficiency and ultimately strengthen our competitive position.  Marsh produced another strong quarter. Revenue increased 8% to $1.4 billion. Underlying revenue rose 7%. This growth was across the board with all geographies contributing, including notable growth in the U.S./Canada division of 6%.  And in Marsh's International division, growth was 18% in Latin America, 10% in Asia Pacific and 5% in EMEA. We are pleased with the growth in the International division considering the very strong results in Latin America and Asia Pacific in last year's first quarter.  Marsh's excellent growth reflects the continuation of outstanding new business development. We are very pleased that client revenue retention rates improved across the board, reaching the highest level since the first quarter of 2003.  Guy Carpenter continued to produce strong results. Revenue in the first quarter increased 5% to $357 million. Underlying revenue growth of 7% was driven by Carpenter's international operations, including strong growth from global specialties, Continental Europe and Asia Pacific. Carpenter's revenue growth reflects its highest level of first quarter new business development since 2003.  This strong growth now extends the trend of Guy Carpenter’s quarterly underlying revenue growth into the fourth consecutive year.  Turning to our Consulting segment. Revenue was $1.3 billion, a 4% increase on both the reported and underlying basis. One of our strategic initiatives is to increase the level of profitability within Consulting. Our first quarter results indicate that we're off to an excellent start. By creating greater linkage between underlying revenue growth and expense growth, both Mercer and Oliver Wyman contributed to Consulting's double-digit growth in earnings and a higher operating margin.  Adjusted operating income rose 24% to $162 million. The adjusted operating margin increased 200 basis points to 12.4%.  Mercer’s first quarter revenue was $957 million, an increase of 4% on both a reported and underlying basis. We had particularly strong growth in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Canada.  Looking at Mercer's underlying revenue by line of business: Investments grew 7%; Health & Benefits increased 6%; Talent, Rewards & Communications rose 5%; Outsourcing increased 4% and Retirement was flat.  Julio Portalatin joined us as Mercer’s CEO in February and he hit the ground running, bringing a new vitality, business acumen and expense discipline to Mercer.  Oliver Wyman's revenue increased 5% to $356 million. The timing of revenue from contracts with acceptance provisions occurred earlier than last year, primarily within Financial Services. This represented slightly less than 1/2 of Oliver Wyman's 6% underlying revenue growth in the quarter. Oliver Wyman saw strong revenue growth in the Consumer and the Health & Life Sciences sectors.  Health & Life Sciences is an important long-term growth sector for Oliver Wyman as health care companies face enormous challenges. Changes impact payers, providers and pharmaceutical companies alike. Over each of the past 2 years, revenue from Health & Life Sciences has grown double digits and is Oliver Wyman's fastest-growing sector.  In conclusion, we are very pleased with the growth throughout each of our operating companies. This is an excellent start to the year.  With that, let me turn it over to Mike.
J. Michael Bischoff: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. As Brian and Dan have discussed, the company has continued to deliver excellent financial performance.  Consolidated revenue was $3.1 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 6% on both a reported and underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 12% to $530 million, and the adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 17.4%.  On a GAAP basis, net income was $347 million or $0.63 per share. Adjusted earnings per share was also $0.63. This represents growth of 13% from the prior year.  Since Dan has already covered the details of our results by operating segment, let's move on to a few other areas. During the quarter, we refinanced a $250 million 6 1/4% senior note that was maturing. We took advantage of low interest rates to secure a rate of 2.3% for the new $250 million 5-year senior note.  Our next debt maturity, also $250 million, is in February of next year and we have taken additional steps over the past year to improve the financial performance of the company. Last July, we successfully completed a $600 million tender and refinancing that extended our debt maturity ladder and reduced interest expense.  In November, we closed a $1 billion 5-year revolving credit facility with lower rates that replaced our 3-year credit facility, which was scheduled to mature later this year. These transactions increased our financial flexibility, refined our capital structure, lowered our refinancing risk, extended maturities of our debt portfolio, slightly delevered our balance sheet and lowered interest expense.  Corporate expense in the first quarter was $48 million, which is higher than normal. The primary reason for this is that certain members of our senior management team became eligible for retirement this year. As a result, their equity grants and stock options, including those granted this year, must be expensed over several months instead of over the normal 3- or 4-year time period.  This will have an even greater impact to corporate expense in the second quarter. But after that, corporate expense should return to a more normalized level.  Investment income this quarter was $20 million compared with $19 million in the first quarter last year. In the second quarter, we anticipate that investment income will be approximately $5 million, compared with an investment loss of $6 million in the second quarter of last year.  Now turning to capital management. Cash utilization is typically the greatest in the first quarter, primarily due to the payment of incentive compensation awards. Our cash position at the end of March exceeded $1.4 billion compared with $1.3 billion a year ago.  Other uses of cash in the quarter included discretionary pension contributions of $100 million into our U.S. plan and $100 million into our U.K. plan. Dividends were $121 million in the first quarter. And for acquisitions, we spent $73 million, the largest of which was Alexander Forbes.  At the end of the first quarter, net debt was $1.5 billion compared with $1.7 billion a year ago.  With that, I'm very happy to turn it back to Brian.
Brian Duperreault: Thank you, Mike. Operator, we are ready for the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Keith Walsh with Citi.
Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: No question the top line looks exceptional, but I guess the question is if I think about the organic growth, the implied expense growth is pretty substantial as well. And why is that, especially with higher-margin Guy Carpenter up, you're pretty much up across the board especially in some of the international businesses where it's higher-margin, I would have expected the margin to be a lot higher. If you could just talk to that.
Brian Duperreault: Okay, I think Dan ought to take that. Dan?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. First of all, I'd start with the overall company. And the overall company's margin improved by 100 basis points in the quarter, so it's a good quarter from a margin perspective. In RIS, we had over 9% growth in adjusted operating income, and as you stated, margins were up 40 basis points. Now the important thing is a couple of things: one, we're confident that we will continue to improve margins in that we are on a path over time to continue to improve RIS' margins as well as Consulting's margins. Now you can always squeeze out a bit more margin in any one quarter, but our leadership team is very much focused on investing consistently and really constantly to not only invest for the future but deliver good results today. It's important to remember, though, that investing while it's a constant, it's not necessarily consistent quarter-to-quarter. It impacts us in different ways and there's moving parts along there. And I'll just give you a little bit of background on some of the things we're doing in the RIS segment. I mean, right off the bat, we've been investing pretty actively in both Guy Carpenter and Marsh in strategic recruitment over the past several years. In March alone, since 2008, we've added almost 450 senior vice presidents and managing directors to the firm and 115 in 2011. So that is rolling in. Also, we're laying the groundwork in our RIS segment for some pretty strong operational improvement, which would help us improve client service while capturing some of our scale, so we really do think that we're investing for better efficiency in the future. That will take multiple quarters, really even 2 or 3 years before we fully manifest the benefits of that. We've created several centers of excellence for Marsh recently around analytics. So for cat modeling, for risk economics, for benchmarking, some of the things that Peter really learned at Guy Carpenter and built at Guy Carpenter, we're building some of the things within Marsh and obviously that costs some money.
Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then just the second question. The top line just significantly higher than what I had in the model and I would have thought, thinking about you guys as a fee -- primarily a fee business, especially in the U.S., why are you seeing that kind of growth? Can you -- are you getting lift on fees that you're charging customers? Can you just give a little more color around that because it seems like it's a lot higher than I would have thought.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay, so there's really 4 factors that are generating our good growth in RIS and in Marsh, in particular. So the #1 factor is improved client revenue retention, which, as we mentioned in the script, is at its highest level since 2003. Now client revenue retention, there's a lot of things that go into client revenue retention, including the outcome of fee discussions or commission discussions with carriers. It's all in the revenue retention line and so that is the leading reason behind the growth. The second leading reason is new business. New business was up 9% in Marsh. As we mentioned on -- in the script, Guy Carpenter had its highest new business first quarter since 2003. The third reason is pricing trends. So pricing trends are complicated. We could probably spend the whole hour talking about pricing, so I don't want to do that. But I would say that property rates are being impacted more than casualty rates. And if you look at the U.S. property, workers' comp, excess casualty are all up moderately. General liability and D&O are still slightly down. If you look at the National Brokerage segment, which is our upper middle market and middle market, it's all up moderately across the board. In International, EMEA is flat to down, Asia Pacific was up in cat property and flat to down in non-cat and Latin America is flat to down except in cat. So from a pricing standpoint, it's not a headwind, but I wouldn't call it a tailwind either. You have to really look at, well, what geography are you talking about, what line of business are you talking about. It's very segmented and since we participate across all of those segments, it's muted from our perspective. And the fourth area that underpinned our strong growth and it's in that sort of order in terms of the impact, the fourth area is exposure unit. So both from a total insurable value and from a payroll standpoint, both were mildly higher. So, overall, just talking about Marsh specifically for a second because I think it demonstrates the broad strength of the growth, it was very well distributed. Every region had a growth rate better than the fourth quarter and better than their run rate for the full year 2011. We had 22 countries with greater than 15% underlying growth and 30 countries with greater than 10% growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: On the Consulting margin, my memory serves that you had been a bit more focused on improving the profitability in Europe; that, that was a priority. Is that perhaps what's driving the bigger part of the Consulting margin improvement? Then, secondly, Dan, you mentioned the revenue associated with, I can't remember exactly what you called it, early acceptances helping the Oliver Wyman number. Is that something that's going to negatively impact prospective quarters?
Brian Duperreault: Okay. Dan, why don't you take the first piece and John can talk about the...
Daniel S. Glaser: Perfect. So in terms of -- as we've mentioned before, we're committed to improving the Consulting segment margins over the next 2 to 3 years. So from that standpoint, we'll very much align expense growth to be lower than revenue growth and in that way we'll improve the margin. I'm not sure where the European focus came from, but it really doesn't stand out as a particular area that we have to improve the Consulting margins. I mean we're generally looking to do that across the board. Many of our Consulting businesses run as much on a line of business global basis as they do on a geographic basis so you can't fix one without the other. So we're doing both at this time.
Brian Duperreault: John, if you take the other piece.
John P. Drzik: Sure. So over the past few years, procurement departments for Oliver Wyman's larger clients have become more heavily involved in contract negotiations and this has led to general acceptance criteria being added into contracts for certain Oliver Wyman projects. These acceptance provisions create situations where revenue for work delivered in early parts of the year were reported as revenue in later quarters once those acceptance criteria were met. Based on an analysis of our experience with these acceptance provisions, we're now able to better align our reported revenue with the timing of project delivery. So as Dan noted, our reported results for Q1 includes the impact of this improved alignment, which did result in higher year-over-year growth in the first quarter and represented a little less than half of our underlying revenue growth in the quarter. And to your question, Larry, it would then play out that the growth later in the year would be lower because of the same effect and probably most principally in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: A couple of quick questions here. First, just quickly, back in the question from Larry. The Oliver Wyman revenues, was there any impact on margins also in the quarter in Consulting from that timing on revenues?
Brian Duperreault: John?
John P. Drzik: Yes, there was some impact, but it wasn't significant and the Consulting margin growth would have continued to be -- or the profit growth would have been 20% or more. But it did have a positive effect of some amount.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then, Brian, I wonder if you could talk about just thoughts on Europe and impacting business. It doesn't seem like the weakness in Europe is having much of an impact on your business right now.
Brian Duperreault: I think it is having an impact, certainly it's having some impact on Oliver Wyman, particularly in the Financial Services component. It would have some impact -- we're in recession in parts of Europe so exposures will be down. So I wouldn't diminish it, but I think the interesting thing is, take Oliver Wyman, they're -- they've been able to really improve in the U.S., counterbalancing that. So I think it basically highlights the benefits of having a global structure and being able to take advantage of the areas where we have significant growth and Dan pointed them out. But, Julio, do you want to comment a little bit?
Julio A. Portalatin: Yes, I would love to. Thanks, Brian. We saw a low- to mid-single digit growth in the U.K. and the broader Europe and the continent and although the macros in Europe, of course, are challenging and you just have to read the newspapers to see that, our sales activity still remains pretty strong. And as you know, we have a pretty balanced portfolio at Mercer. It's a pretty global operation for us. We look at this as geographically and by line of business. And if you note that 70% of our revenue is pretty much reoccurring revenue in Retirement, Outsourcing and Benefits area, especially Investments as well, we've had a solid base of renewal business as well. So if Europe continues to worsen, of course it affects everybody, but that's why it's important for us to maximize our global footprint and ensure that all areas are really achieving their objectives and continuing to move on all cylinders.
Operator: Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: With regards to market conditions in the P&C space, what I've been hearing a lot is that it's an income statement-driven marketing transition. So first, do you agree with that? And then if you do, what do you think would the outcome be for the market if this turned out to be a benign year in terms of weather events?
Brian Duperreault: Well, I'll start by saying it's always great to try to characterize these. I mean they all have to have a name, I guess, what this market is. I mean the one thing is it's always a little different. Is it a hard market? I think not in the definitions we would apply. I think Dan pointed out that maybe there's some benefit in some areas for the carriers in terms of rate, but it's not across the board, and there are lines of business where rates are going down. Whole geographies where rates are down except for cat. So I don't know what you would call it. For us, it's just the market. That's the market we're in. But, Dan, you wanted to add anything?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, I would just -- we don't -- we've been in the business here a long time and market cycles, our brokerage and risk management advisors work through the cycles and the cycles tend to be more downward pressure than upward pressure and so we don't -- we build our business around that fact. When we look at this, generally, the market follows levels of losses and the levels of losses have been specific to geography and specific to lines of business, so it's a pretty targeted correction of rates in certain areas, but not a broad-based "blood in the eye" hard market where underwriters are, en masse, walking away from clients. I mean we don't see that. There's still competition for new business. There's still innovation in the insurance market. And so overall, it's a market which doesn't have a tremendous amount of conviction in either direction.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, and then looking ahead to the summer on the Consulting front, what would the impact, best case/worst case scenario, be of the Supreme Court decision regarding health care reform for Mercer?
Brian Duperreault: Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin: Yes, let me comment on that, if I may. The Health & Benefits business continues to be an evolving business in the U.S. and if you look at it, to a certain extent, also globally. Here, of course, with the Supreme Court's spending decision on individual mandate or maybe even more of an impact across the board, we're well positioned really for all types of outcomes depending on how the Supreme Court rules. And we've got significant amount of activity taking place, for example, in the private exchanges. We've got good activity taking place globally, again reminding everyone this -- we have a global business with our H&B where a lot of things are happening. And we're investing appropriately to make sure that whatever outcome comes out of the U.S. portion of that we're well positioned, and we believe we are.
Operator: We'll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: In the first quarter, we saw much faster earnings growth in the Consulting business than RIS and I'd like to get your directional thoughts as to whether you think that trend will continue.
Brian Duperreault: Dan?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes. Well, one, we made up a lot of ground in RIS over a number of years and we've really expanded our margins, so the pace of margin improvement in Consulting is not a surprise to us because Consulting had reduced margins through the economic downturn and now is recovering from that. When we look at our overall focus is on long-term delivering 10% or better improvement in adjusted operating income and that's our first thing, is growing profitability. Secondarily, we focus on margin. But as I was saying before, margin can be a little bit of a fool's game. You can get the margin you want and it actually hurt your business over a mid- and long term, and so we're very much focused on continuing to invest in our business as we go forward. When I look at the Consulting business in general, when you look over the last few years, the adjusted margin in Consulting in 2009 was 10.3%, then 11.4%, then 11.8%, so I wouldn't get ahead of ourselves necessarily and say that 200 basis points is the new reality quarter-by-quarter. We look at expenses aligned with revenues so revenue grew by 4%, expenses grew by 2%. That's what gave the big lift. Obviously, our expense growth, when we factor in April 1 raises, will tick up a little bit, which would create a squeeze in that basis point improvement unless we grow the top line more. So our focus, though, in Consulting is growing the margins in a sustainable way and we believe that it will vary quarter-by-quarter, but we'll deliver that margin improvement over the next several years.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, then also just one follow-up. Dan, you gave a really complete overview on what the drivers of the RIS growth and Marsh, in particular. Were those in rank order? Improved client revenue retention, new business pricing, exposure, was that from the greatest benefit to the least?
Daniel S. Glaser: Absolutely.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: First quarter obviously a big cash usage quarter for you, but you are sitting on a fair amount of cash in the balance sheet and obviously you'll be seeing that ramp as the year progresses. You've talked about the trade-off in the past of how you think about deploying cash either M&A or repurchase, but I was wondering if you can maybe refresh your thinking there in the trade-off given that we haven't seen repurchase in the last couple of quarters. And then also, maybe some commentary on your view of the M&A environment, pipeline in both Brokerage and Consulting in current deal -- pricing of deals in current environment.
Brian Duperreault: Okay, well, we’re happy to. Yes, we don't -- we have -- simply it's been to have an authorization to buy back shares. We haven't bought them back in the first quarter because, as you cited, it's a high-cash usage quarter. But we certainly have the intent to buy back shares through the year. As Dan, as you pointed out, my priority is always acquisitions, accretive acquisitions, would be the preference because of its growth aspects of that. But we did say that we certainly want to acquire at least enough shares to blunt the dilution from our equity grants that occur. So that runs -- pick a number, $150 million a year or something like that would be the equity grants levels. And so that certainly is something that you should expect us to do through the year. Past that, we certainly will weigh the choices and it’s what's the most accretive use of cash after that. In terms of the acquisition pipeline, we feel good about it. I think we have a lot of very interesting opportunities. Some come to fruition, some don't. We do take a look at a lot of things and I would not limit that to necessarily just the agency business of Marsh. That pipeline is good, but we are looking at some other things. We want to grow our business either by adding components that we don't have, which will enhance the capabilities, sort of our R&D approach, through acquisition or just to increase geography. In Marsh, with the HSBC acquisition and then the price -- the Forbes acquisition, we increased geography significantly. I hope we can find some more like that. We keep looking. So I think growth through acquisition is an important part of our long-term growth and you heard me talk about how we believe in that. So I hope that answers your question, Dan.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes, most of my questions have been answered. Just a quick one for Mike Bischoff. Interest expense, just give us a sense, if you don't mind, for the balance of the year what the quarterly run rate’s going to look like, given the refinancing?
J. Michael Bischoff: Jay, that's a very good question. When we're looking at interest expense, it was about $46 million this quarter and the $250 million refinancing with 4 percentage points off will contribute an additional benefit of about $7 million to $8 million. Because we did that maturity in March, it really did not impact the first quarter, so you'll be looking at about a benefit of $1.5 million to $2 million a quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ray Iardella with Macquarie.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: I guess maybe a broader question for Julio now that he's been at the company 90, 100 days. Maybe if you could talk about the strengths that you see of the Mercer organization and maybe some of the challenges, if you will, ahead for the near and intermediate term.
Julio A. Portalatin: Thanks for that question. I have been here, now today is actually my 3-month anniversary, so just to celebrate that. But over the past 3 months, I've traveled extensively, as you can imagine, and met with large numbers of clients and colleagues and I've been very impressed really with the deepness of the relationships we have with clients and the real added value that comes from our employees and colleagues around the world. I’ve also, as you can imagine, spent quite a lot of time immersing myself in the business itself and all of our financials and some of the things that may come out and pop out as potential opportunities. On balance, I'm very excited about what I've learned so far. Mercer's a strong global company. It has a solid position in all of our major businesses and at the same time, we're also very excited about the potential, notwithstanding our strong position, as I stated. In terms of early decisions, the things that I've been focused on most have been largely internal. However, at the same time, we’ve kicked off a strategic planning process and my goal is that by the end of the second quarter we have a clear perspective of where we want to take Mercer over the next 3 to 5 years. But I must tell you though, as I look at our global footprint, it's really terrific across 40 countries. Maximizing that footprint certainly will be one of the things that we'll be focusing on as we look at the strategic direction of Mercer going forward.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: That's helpful. And then I guess another question for Mike. I mean, stock option expense, I know you said it might tick up, I think, in the second quarter. Did you quantify that, or is there any way you could help us quantify that?
J. Michael Bischoff: If you look at our supplemental schedule on Page 9, you'll see a specific item with regard to stock option expense. And as you recall, this is information that we provide quarterly, so that people can get a better idea not only of the movement there, but some of our noncash items. And you can see in the quarter that it went up by $4 million. We certainly would expect that, while it's not just stock option, it also includes the restricted stock, the total equity awards. And you certainly would -- we expect it to go up an additional $4 million to $5 million in second quarter. And then after that, we will absorb the accelerated amortization and we'll go to a more normalized corporate expense run rate for the third and fourth quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: On ACE's quarterly call, Evan Greenberg noted that some of the data system monetization from the big 2 brokers had started taking root. I was wondering if you could sort of describe that, not necessarily a quantification, but what inning you're in, in terms of expecting revenues from that?
Brian Duperreault: Sure. Okay, well, Dan?
Daniel S. Glaser: A couple of things. One, we do provide market consulting and data analytics to insurers. And basically, those services make insurers more competitive on our clients' business. I mean they get more competitive because they set their appetites more clearly in the business that they want to see, and therefore, their quota submission ratios go up, making them more efficient. And also because they are targeting their submissions, they can have their buy-and-quote ratios improve as well and so that's something that they’re very interested in. Overall, we've described many times and we've been consistent in our approach, that we think that the real issue is carrier revenue streams from -- all carrier revenue streams. And as we've said before, we think that all carrier revenue streams create the potential for conflicts of interest, and so we're very in tune with that and we believe that all brokers receive carrier revenue in one form or another and each of those forms requires a good system of internal systems and controls to make sure that we're managing conflicts properly. At Marsh, we've got many different businesses, many geographies and so there's not a "one size fits all." So from our basis, the most important thing we're committed to is transparency and putting the interest of our clients first. In terms of amounts of money and what inning we're in, this is -- in the aggregate when you look at carrier revenue streams, you look at basic commissionable business as, by far, the biggest part in that will remain, by far, the biggest part. And we're not going to break out individual aspects of carrier revenue streams.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, that was helpful. Is there anything analogous on the Consulting side?
Daniel S. Glaser: There is -- the only area that becomes analogous would be in Health & Benefits, and in some parts of the Employee Benefits business we're trying to create the same kind of big data insights to insurance carriers. But that's really where insurance carriers participate on the Consulting side is in EB.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Crédit Suisse.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: In regards to margins, I believe certain geographies and this is alluded to in the first question on the call, overseas, have higher operating margins, is that correct? And if so, is that one of the main reasons you're confident about improving margin dynamics going forward?
Brian Duperreault: Well, the answer is yes. Different geographies, you have different margins. Particularly in Marsh's International operations, the margins are significantly higher than in the U.S. and so growth rates where margins are higher will always lift it. So no question about that. Is that where you're getting at, Mike?
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Yes, so if we expected growth in Lat Am and certain parts of Asia to continue at a healthy growth rate, then should we expect that dynamic to lift the margin going forward, or is there other underlying things? I know growth is picking up in the U.S. now.
Brian Duperreault: Yes, it's really a scale issue. The size of our U.S. business and our U.K. business, in particular, makes our other regions look fairly small. And so even though we've got better growth and very strong margins, ultimately, it will take quite a while. So you're right and maybe when we're sitting here in 5 and 10 years from now, we'll be able to really view it clearly. But it's going to take a long time to have an impact. The biggest impact is improving our U.K. and U.S. margins as we've done over the last several years and that would have more of an impact on our overall margins.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And lastly in regards to fee versus commission income. In the recent past, Peter who I know is not present today, he's talked about pushing more fee-based business within the Insurance segment. I believe the term he used is a la carte. Does that mean the Insurance segment is less levered to insurance price increases in the current cycle versus the past?
Brian Duperreault: Dan?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure, okay. So if you look broadly, first of all, Marsh is about 50-50 between fee and commissionable business. It's weighted toward the U.S. about 60-40 and weighted toward -- in favor of fee and weighted internationally, about 60-40 in favor of commission. What Peter was referring to, the a la carte nature, would be that some of the analytics and modeling and risk consulting that we do apart from the transaction within the Marsh world that we could create fee revenue from those streams as opposed to building it in as a bundled solution for our clients. And so it's not movement of commissionable business to fee business. It's actually just creating additional fee revenue.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So just following up on a question before, Brian, about capital deployment, should we think -- should we interpret your position on buybacks to offset dilution as a change in terms of the priority you're giving to buybacks in terms of capital deployment, or is that just kind of a nuance? And just one follow-up.
Brian Duperreault: Thanks. Yes -- no. Nuance might be a better description of it. I mean the priority is accretive acquisitions. That remains, and I hope it always remains that way. But I did want to clarify that we do have an authorization for stock buybacks. We intend to use it. We won't use it every quarter because it may be that an acquisition is there or in the first quarter because we have uses of cash for other -- for our compensation. But I just wanted to make sure everybody understood that there is this commitment to get at least the dilution neutralized and then from there we have to make decisions about accretion and which is a more accretive use of the cash. I suppose there could be a time where we would have a whole year go by because we’d made acquisitions and didn't buy back shares, but there is a desire long-term to do that. I hope that helps.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Sure, it does. And then just one question on the -- you mentioned -- someone on the call mentioned investments that you're making on the expense side. Just trying to think how much do revenues need to rise in order to allow Marsh to meet the overall earnings goal that you kind of outlined in Investor Day, and is the threshold for growth higher now than it was at Investor Day just given the investments you're making on the expense side?
Brian Duperreault: Well, I think Dan talked about that. And I think what we're trying to point out is our goals are long term. Our goals are double-digit growth in profitability. And you've got to be intelligent about how you deploy your resources to ensure that, that long-term goal can be met. And it sometimes means that you have to put monies in investments, which have long-term benefits. You have a return-on-investment criteria that we apply. So it's not that our goals changed. We outlined a pretty simple arithmetic around growth in expense and growth in revenue. And we are mindful of times when we have a higher growth rate, we've got 7% growth rates here. That's a wonderful thing because it gives us the opportunity to invest whereas if we have lower growth rates, like we had in '09 and '10, we have to be intelligent about the investments. Now we still invested, but the opportunities, the ability, the flexibility we have enhances dramatically. And so I thought it was a wonderful thing to be able to take that 7% growth rate and do something with it that will be in the long-term interest of the company. And so that's where we are with it. 10%-plus growth in our earnings is the goal and we are going to continue to do this over a very long period of time, that's the commitment.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And does that imply then that the growth of top line is sort of an enabler for the investing on the expense side and that you'll kind of look to that sort of 10% growth as a goal and hopefully increasing the quality of the earnings base, but kind of managing the expense side given how much room you have to do that and still meet your financial objectives given revenue growth? Is that how should we think about that sort of trade-off?
Brian Duperreault: Yes, that's the art of management. I mean that's the beauty of it. You said it in simple terms. I mean it is a pretty simple thing to do -- I mean to say, harder to execute. And so we're not just going to squeeze out margin and have it drop to the bottom line if instead we could make an investment that is in the best interest of the shareholder long term. So we're going to do the latter. And as I said, it's just flexibility and freedom, and our degrees of freedom are rising. Dan wants to add something.
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, I would just point out that this is not a quarter-by-quarter thing. It's not that you can manage investments so clearly that you just have it wholly aligned. So you may see some quarters where you'll see bigger margin expansion, as an example, because it’s just not as consistently tied. But what we're painting is what our philosophy is over a mid- and long term and that's what you'll see as our investors stay with us over the 5-year period, 10-year period, they'll see an overall consistency, but it will vary quarter by quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Klauber with William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Within Consulting, Health & Benefits and Reward, Talents continue to have relatively good growth rates. Is that more driven by new business or by growth at existing clients?
Brian Duperreault: Julio?
Julio A. Portalatin: Yes. As you can imagine, a good proportion of our business, overall 70%, is reoccurring revenue, okay? And balance, we really see that as being a strong driver. Now there's been obviously new opportunities. We’ve introduced new concepts to approach the markets, especially in the H&B business. You go around the world, you talk to CEOs about what's on their mind and obviously there's a lot of talent questions in their minds and we're providing solutions in those areas as well. We’ve recently launched the Mercer Marsh Benefits that we think really gives us a excellent foothold in client-facing activities in a common and constructive way. And it's proven to be in the early days pretty expansive in how it's working. So there's a lot of things that are going on that impacts our business positively also on the new business development side. But I'd like to remind again that 70% of our business is reoccurring and that's renewing at very good rate and very good opportunities.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, and just one follow-up. Outsourcing also actually had a nice turnaround from the last quarter. Well, I guess, what's driving that?
Julio A. Portalatin: Well, we had some wins in the early part of last year that came on in this quarter. And as a result, we saw some good year-on-year improvement on top line. We continue to be focused on bringing new clients on that side of the business and have some good prospects as well.
Brian Duperreault: I think we're going to end the call at this point. But before I do, there's a couple of things. I want to, first of all, on behalf of all my colleagues, extend our best wishes to Peter Zaffino and his family. And lastly, I do want to end by thanking the 53,000 colleagues around the world for your hard work and dedication, which really makes this such a fun place to be and also thank the clients out there for continuing to support us. And thank you for your interest in the stock, and we'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Fourth quarter 2011 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on Marsh & McLennan Companies' website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. In particular, references during this conference call to anticipated or expected results of operations for 2012 or supplemental periods are forward-looking statements and Marsh & McLennan Companies' actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. Please refer to Marsh & McLennan Companies' most recent SEC filings as well as the company's earnings release, which are available on the Marsh & McLennan Companies' website, for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies
Brian Duperreault: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our results as reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and COO; and Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our Operating Company CEOs, Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarksi of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff.  My remarks will focus primarily on our full year results and Dan will provide more detail on the fourth quarter. Vanessa will then update you on our financial position. Before we begin the discussion of our results, I'd like to welcome Julio to our company. Julio joined us as President and CEO of Mercer 2 weeks ago. He comes to us from AIG, where he held a broad range of senior positions over 19 years. Most recently, he was President and CEO of Chartis Growth Economies. Julio has had a very successful track record of running large global businesses. His strong leadership characteristics and international experience will serve him well as Mercer’s CEO.  Now let's move to our financial results. I'm very pleased that we continue to deliver revenue and earnings growth across the enterprise. Marsh & McLennan's performance this year was outstanding. In 2011, we generated revenue growth of 9% with 5% growth on an underlying basis. Importantly, we continue to achieve this revenue growth while maintaining control over expenses with adjusted underlying expenses increasing 4%. As a result, we produced 12% growth in adjusted operating income for the year. In fact, this is the second consecutive year that both of our operating segments achieved double-digit growth in operating income.  You've heard me talk many times since our September 2010 Investor Day about our plans to produce double-digit organic growth in adjusted operating income. Over the past 2 years, we have delivered against that goal, averaging 11% growth. Within Risk and Insurance Services, revenue increased 9%. Importantly, underlying revenue growth of 5% represents a significant increase from the 2% underlying growth in the prior year, and we generated 12% growth in adjusted operating income and margin improvement.  Marsh produced underlying revenue growth of 4% with all major geographies contributing. This was driven by higher client retention rates and new business development. Guy Carpenter also produced impressive results in 2011. Underlying revenue growth was 5% driven by both ongoing revenue with new business development and higher retention rates. This was a milestone year for Carpenter as well as revenue exceeded $1 billion for the first time.  The Consulting segment also delivered an impressive performance. Revenue grew 9% with underlying growth of 5%. Adjusted operating income rose 12% and the segment margin improved as well. Mercer produced underlying revenue growth of 4% and Oliver Wyman's growth was 7% for the second straight year.  So in summary, throughout Marsh & McLennan last year, we saw revenue increases and higher levels of profitability. We are very pleased with this performance, which confirms the investment case we articulated at Investor Day in September 2010. We generated organic growth and adjusted operating income of 12%. Growth in adjusted EPS was 13%, excluding the early debt retirement and these are the earnings from which we plan to grow this coming year. Our dividend yield averaged 3%. We maintained low capital requirements. We generated high levels of cash and we made progress on lowering the company's risk profile. As we move forward, we remain committed to focusing on profitable growth and prudent deployment of our excess cash flow in order to produce outstanding long-term returns for our shareholders.  With that, let me turn it over to Dan to review our fourth quarter results in more detail.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter of 2011, Marsh & McLennan continued its excellent performance. We generated solid growth in both underlying revenue and adjusted operating income. For the sixth consecutive quarter, we achieved underlying revenue growth at each of our operating companies. Revenue rose 4% to $2.9 billion in the quarter while underlying revenue growth was 3%.  Risk and Insurance Services revenue was up 6% to $1.6 billion with underlying revenue growth of 4% and with ongoing effective expense management, which is now embedded within the culture of the Risk and Insurance Services segment, adjusted operating income increased 11% to $288 million. The segment achieved a 90 basis point increase in margin while continuing its pace of investment in global analytics, client technologies and strategic recruitment and absorbing additional severance costs. The positive momentum continued at Marsh as it produced another strong quarter. Revenue increased 6% to $1.4 billion in the quarter. Underlying revenue rose 4%. Marsh's growth was across all geographies, led by increases of 9% in Asia-Pacific and 8% in Latin America, reflecting high retention rates and new business development. In fact, for the year, new business production exceeded $1 billion.  In the U.S./Canada division, underlying revenue growth was 2% in the quarter. Last month, we significantly expanded Marsh's operations in South Africa, Botswana and Namibia with the acquisition of the insurance broking business of Alexander Forbes. The completion of the acquisition of Alexander Forbes operations in 5 other African countries is on track, and Marsh continued to build its agency platform with the acquisition of Seitlin Insurance, one of the largest insurance broking firms in South Florida with revenue of $24 million. Marsh & McLennan Agency now has annual guidance revenue of $330 million.  Now turning to reinsurance broking, Guy Carpenter continued to produce strong results. Revenue was $193 million, an increase of 5% from both the reported and underlying basis. This growth was led by its international operations, reflecting the successful execution of Carpenter's long-term business strategy.  Carpenter has now produced underlying revenue growth every quarter over the past 3 years. This growth was accomplished through ongoing strong new business development and high client retention levels.  Turning to our Consulting segment, we continued to generate revenue growth. More importantly, both Mercer and Oliver Wyman contributed to double-digit growth in earnings and higher margins for the year. At Mercer, fourth quarter revenue increased 3% to $940 million and underlying revenue growth was 2% with all geographic regions contributing to this growth. Over the past 10 months, I have had an opportunity to explore Mercer’s businesses and analyze its strengths, opportunities and challenges. Overall, I am very positive about Mercer’s future. My key observations are that Mercer is a global leader in retirement, health and benefits, as well as talent, rewards and communications and Mercer has important capabilities in outsourcing and investments. Mercer has a committed and talented colleague base and deep client relationships and Mercer is well-positioned to continue to expand both organically and through selective acquisitions. Julio, Mercer’s new CEO, brings a wealth of experience to his new role. At Chartis, he had responsibility for operations in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and Central Europe. Previous key leadership roles he held included President of the Worldwide Accident and Health Division at AIU. I'm confident that Julio, with the help of the Mercer leadership team, will drive profitable growth.  Looking at Mercer’s financial performance for the year, I am generally pleased with the results. Underlying revenue grew 4%, retirement declined 1% and outsourcing was flat. Health and benefits, talent rewards and communications and Investments all showed very strong revenue growth.  Turning to Oliver Wyman. On the third quarter earnings call, we indicated that it would be difficult for Oliver Wyman to achieve growth in the fourth quarter due to the economic uncertainty in Europe.  I am pleased to report that Oliver Wyman's results in the quarter came in slightly stronger than we expected with revenue of $406 million, an increase of 2% on both the reported and underlying basis, representing Oliver Wyman's eighth consecutive quarter of underlying growth. For the year, Oliver Wyman's overall results were also strong, including underlying revenue growth of 7%.  In conclusion, we are very pleased with the 12% growth in adjusted earnings per share the company produced in the fourth quarter. This capped off a very successful year for Marsh & McLennan both financially and operationally. We remain confident regarding our ability to produce double-digit growth in operating income. With that, let me turn it over to Vanessa.
Vanessa A. Wittman: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. As you have heard, the strong financial performance of Marsh & McLennan continued in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, net income was $256 million or $0.46 per share. Adjusted earnings per share was also $0.46, representing growth of 12% from the prior year. We are proud of the tremendous progress made over the past year to greatly reduce items that are excluded from adjusted operating income. As a result, our GAAP and adjusted earnings for the year are similar. In 2011, on an expense base of $9.9 billion and operating income of $1.6 billion, the net adjustments to GAAP totaled only $23 million. For the year, adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.77. This includes $72 million of expense related to the early extinguishment of debt last July. Excluding this item, the growth in adjusted EPS was 13%.  Now let me add some color regarding other items. In the fourth quarter, we took advantage of favorable credit market conditions by arranging a new $1 billion 5-year revolving credit facility that replaced the 3-year credit facility that was due to expire later in 2012. This new facility increases our financial flexibility with an extended duration and reduces our costs going forward. In the fourth quarter, we had an investment loss of $4 million. In the first quarter of 2012, we anticipate that investment income will be similar to the first quarter of last year, which was $19 million. Looking at taxes, as you know, the adjusted tax rate fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter primarily due to our geographic mix of earnings and discreet items such as audit settlements and valuation allowances.  For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 30% and we feel a tax rate of between 30% and 31% is reasonable for financial modeling purposes in 2012. Discontinued operations for 2011 of $33 million includes a credit of $50 million relating to the sales of Putnam and Kroll, the bulk of which relates to Putnam. At the time of the sales, we provided certain indemnities primarily related to tax uncertainties and legal contingencies. The credit results from the resolution of tax and legal matters as well as insurance recoveries. Also affecting discontinued operations is the impact of Marsh's decision to sell its life insurance BPO unit.  This unit provides policy, claims, call center and accounting operations to life insurance companies. Marsh ceased investing in and is selling the BPO business. Capitalized software of $17 million net of tax was written off in 2011. These items are described more fully in the supplemental schedules in our press release.  Now let me make a few observations regarding pensions. We have seen marked increases in our reported pension expense over the past 3 years, primarily due to declining discount rates as well as the impact of asset losses in 2008. At year end 2011, interest rates for longer debt maturities used to measure pension liabilities were significantly lower than the prior year. The accounting for pensions is extremely complicated. In addition to the effective discount rates and asset returns, annual pension expense reflects the impact of factors such as salary increases over many years, mortality rates, demographics, inflation and cash contributions to name a few. Based on our year end measurement, which takes all of these factors into account, pension expense in 2012 will increase. Net of bonuses and other mitigating items, operating income will be reduced by approximately $20 million or $0.025 per share for 2012.  Moving to capital management. Our cash position increased substantially throughout the year, reflecting the strong earnings power of the company. Uses of cash in the fourth quarter included $120 million for dividends and $121 million for acquisitions, including Seitlin and a partial funding of Alexander Forbes.  For the year, major discretionary uses of cash included $480 million for dividends, $361 million for share repurchases, $258 million for acquisitions, $100 million for the reduction of debt in July and $72 million of expense related to that early extinguishment of debt. Year-end cash was $2.1 billion. In the first quarter, anticipated uses of cash include the annual payment of incentive compensation awards, our regular quarterly dividend of approximately $120 million, about $100 million for acquisitions, including the remaining portion of the insurance broking operations of Alexander Forbes and a $100 million tax-deductible discretionary contribution to our U.S. pension plan.  We also have a $250 million senior note maturing in March. We continue to maintain our financial flexibility regarding the funding of this maturity. At the end of the year, our net debt was $815 million. This is our lowest level of net debt at year end since 1996, which speaks to our efforts in strengthening our balance sheet. With that, I'll turn it back to Brian.
Brian Duperreault: Thanks, Vanessa. Operator, I think we're ready for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Mr. Keith Walsh with Citi.
Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: First question, I guess, Dan in your commentary -- or this question's for Dan or Vanessa, you mentioned absorbing additional severance costs in the brokerage margin. Now, but you do breakout restructuring and Consulting and corporate this quarter. So I guess the question is what's the dollar amount threshold to when this gets excluded from adjusted EPS?
Brian Duperreault: Vanessa, why don't you take that?
Vanessa A. Wittman: Sure. So Keith, the way that we have approached restructuring is that if there are permanent changes to the business, then it meets our threshold for restructuring. And if there are changes that may be temporary or the dollar’s being reinvested, then it runs through earnings. So it isn't really a dollar threshold, but a function of what's being changed.
Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then my second question's for Alex. A lot of news reports about the 1 1 renewal with some large insurers retaining a lot more coverage and buying less reinsurance. Can you talk a little bit about how, if any, impact that would have on your organic revenues as I believe they were clients of yours?
Alexander S. Moczarksi: First of all, obviously, yes, we have seen rate increases, rate on line on catastrophic property in general somewhere between 5% and 15% on even loss-free contracts. Companies are -- they do have budgets vis-à-vis what they buy. Also we have fee business. We have cats and remuneration. So we will expect to have some tailwind, but it's not going to be proportional to the rate increases and I'll take that little bit of wind any day.
Operator: We'll go next to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I'm wondering more on the Marsh side if you could talk about the impact on pricing -- from pricing on your revenue. It feels as if listening to the company and listening to the dialogue in the industry that things are getting better. It did seem as if your underlying growth slowed basically in every region versus the third quarter. I know quarter-to-quarter, sometimes your comparisons get distorted, but what's happening from a pricing standpoint? Is there more of a benefit now than there was, say, earlier in the year?
Brian Duperreault: I think Peter should take that, Peter?
Peter Zaffino: Sure. There absolutely is a trend of rate improving when you look at earlier in the year as well as year-over-year. We generally speak about a theme of rate stabilization, but you need to really break it down into components. You need to break it down to geography, segment of business and then also size. If you look at the segments of business, property is clearly the one line of business that's having the most rate impact and we saw that in our own portfolio within Q4. Cat-exposed areas like Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Chile and Thailand are having the impacts. And if you go to you geography, it's really the U.S. and Asia-Pacific that are having the biggest impact. There's more lines of business. So, for instance, in the U.S., we've seen property, workers comp, as well as excess casualty and general liability starting to increase, and we'll see that trend probably into 2012. But when looking at the rest of the international geography, there are still headwinds particularly in casualty where rates are stable, improving, but still generally speaking, down year-over-year. So when I look at the U.K., parts of Europe and Asia, there's still a little bit of a headwind. So you really need to look at the overall composite.
Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then I guess just to follow up, given that throughout the year, let's take the U.S., where the rating environment didn't get better, I guess I was a little surprised to see the organic growth rates slow in the fourth quarter. Was anything unusual that impacted the year-over-year comparison at all?
Peter Zaffino: Yes, in the U.S., I think our performance is actually better than the 2% and I'll tell you why, we had for some reason a lot more one-time items in Q4 of 2010 that came off, and so they had a bigger hurdle in terms of growth. And then they also had some impact on rate but in our U.S. business, we have a consumer business, we also have stars and they didn't probably see the composite rate lift that the traditional part of the U.S. did. So I think the performance is actually better than the 2 and again, we just had some one-time items that we had to overcome from 2010.
Operator: And we will go next to Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Vanessa, when you give higher tax rate guidance for 2012 compared to 2011, does that reflect optimism in terms of the U.S.?
Vanessa A. Wittman: I'm sorry, Meyer, I didn't hear your- - the last part. You said -- can you just repeat the question? I'm sorry.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Absolutely. Should we interpret the higher tax rate guidance in 2012 relative to 2011 despite faster growth outside the U.S. as a reflection of greater optimism regarding domestic earnings?
Vanessa A. Wittman: Actually, we're fairly consistent, '11 to '12, Meyer. We just -- we can't pinpoint it precisely for you because we can't predict the exact mix of earnings. So we had guided between 30% and 31% for '11 and we're giving the same guidance for '12.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. Shouldn't I expect it to go down as international operations grow a little bit faster than the domestic ones though?
Vanessa A. Wittman: Well, that also is -- yes, except for the fact that if you repatriate earnings back to the U.S., you're subjected to the U.S. tax rate.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, good point. And second question if I can, is there any way of ball parking the impacts of the life insurance BPO business on recent either organic growth or margins?
Vanessa A. Wittman: It was a small revenue business and I would say it has a de minimis impact on either revenue or margin in both the quarter and then the year-over-year.
Operator: And we will go next to Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Maybe a follow-up on Meyer's question on taxes for next year. Clearly, your peers have now either moved or are in the process of moving to a more favorable tax jurisdiction possibly putting you at a slight disadvantage from that sense. Is that something you're thinking about?
Brian Duperreault: Yaron, this is Brian. You know what? I guess I'm not surprised by the question, but I'm not going to talk about what other companies do or speculate about what we might or might not do, so I'm really not going to comment.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. Yes, and then maybe talking about the -- about Julio’s appointment at Mercer. This is now the second CEO appointment that comes from somebody from outside of the industry, outside of the Consulting industry at least. What does that mean about the talent pool or the executive base at Mercer today? How are you thinking about that and with a P&C veteran coming in, how long will it take before Julio is really ready to make some initiatives and changes in the business?
Brian Duperreault: Okay, and I think Dan wants to take this question.
Daniel S. Glaser: Well, first of all, we ran an exhaustive search and we looked at both internal candidates and external candidates and we had several strong internal candidates. So really, the way we phrase this in terms of how we were looking at it, we really wanted to find someone truly exceptional that would be able to not only drive Mercer to better performance, but also contribute at the executive committee level of Marsh & McLennan, and so I'm very happy with where we have landed. I've known Julio for more than 10 years. We've worked together at AIG and Julio brings all -- 5 of our 6 members of our operating company and leadership team with Brian and I have experience both on the insurance company side and on the brokerage side. Julio has that, but also adds an additional dimension in that he has experience in the consumer businesses and in health and benefit, having run one of the largest health and benefits organizations in the world in AIU Accident & Health. So really, the driver for us was getting somebody who had deep experience in running large global businesses, had a lot of experience in running a matrix environment on a global basis, was well-schooled in P&L management and running a business from -- always having revenue exceed expense, and really a track record where every job over the course of a 30-year career was more successful than the one before. So in addition to a lot of inspirational and personal leadership characteristics, I think I'm very comfortable that Julio will be a great addition. Now how long it will take him to be fully up to speed, I would give it another 2 weeks, because he’s hit the ground running and based upon his questions, he's getting there in a fast pace.
Operator: And we'll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I just want to set the baseline for 2012 earnings. Should we be thinking as in terms of $1.77 of adjusted earnings per share plus the $0.09 impact from debt extinguishment cost in 2011, so the baseline, the starting point is more like $1.86 and double-digit earnings growth off that?
Brian Duperreault: Jay, that's the way I'm looking at it.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And on the risk capital holdings, it was -- so you're saying $19 million in the first quarter. It was $9 million for all of 2011. Should we expect a better result in '12?
Vanessa A. Wittman: Jay, that one’s too difficult to call. We've really seen a lot of volatility over the course of 2011 and no reason not to expect the similar volatility. We can -- we give you what we have as we've got it because we report on a one quarter lag. We saw a very low number, a negative number in Q4, which was really on the back of the horrible equity markets in Q3. And then we -- for Q1, we saw the equity markets recover in Q4 and that's reflected in that -- in the $19 million number we gave you.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Right. So I mean, if equity -- let's cross our fingers, if equity market stays strong in 1Q, that should be pretty good for second quarter results then right?
Brian Duperreault: Well, your guess is as good as ours. I don't know. It's hard to speculate, it really is, Jay. I wish we could give more, but it's not something we have control of so...
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I understand. And then for Peter, we had overall modest margin expansion in Risk and Insurance Services for all of 2011, what are the levers you have to generate margin expansion again in 2012?
Peter Zaffino: Well, certainly, we're going to continue on the path of having very strong client retention, very strong new businesses, as Dan said in his comments. We had over $1 billion of new business. We've been investing in 2011 for the future of 2012 and make sure that we're going to position our businesses for strong top line growth while controlling expenses. And we've had a lot of strong growth across the world. Dan gave you the quarter numbers, but for Latin America, we had 14% organic growth for the year. Asia Pac was 9%. EMEA was 4% and so we want to continue to focus on high-growth areas and make sure our investments are yielding that type of benefit on the top line and bottom line. So we're very well-positioned for 2012.
Brian Duperreault: And maintain expense control. Alex is a part of this segment. Well, Alex, why don't you add to that?
Alexander S. Moczarksi: Yes, it's pretty similar to Pete's -- Peter's. We've got a good revenue pipeline. Our expense discipline is good. Again, the overseas, the international piece is exciting. Also on the facultative side, we see good growth. So we're cautiously optimistic we'll continue to improve the margin.
Operator: We'll go next to Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: I have kind of a Consulting and maybe it's a corporate question combined. We're hearing that some of the retirement annuity companies are offering annuity products as a solution for defined benefit pension plans. And I'm just wondering if from a corporate standpoint, if that's something that you've looked at and maybe from a Consulting standpoint, is that a product that you guys believe in? Is it a product that you recommend? Is it a product that competes with your business? Just curious how that fits into the grand scheme of things.
Daniel S. Glaser: Well, I'll take that, Larry. So it's Dan here. A couple of things, one, clearly, those type of products, the large annuity products and pension buyouts, so to speak, have been around for about 20 years, but they've gone through cycles of when they become more attractive to companies. We're definitely in the mix with regard to not only creating those sorts of products, but also advising clients on when it's appropriate to purchase some of that type of product. And particularly, there's been a fair amount of activity in the U.K. and I would say that we're one of the market leaders in the U.K. on that type of thing. It's a de-risking approach. And so from that standpoint, oftentimes, when a DB plan closes and freezes, then it transfers in terms of responsibility from, say, the HR, Senior HR Officer to the CFO, and the CFO often would look at, well, how can we bring the risk down on a frozen plan, and so we've been very actively engaged in that. We don't think of that as a competitor to our capabilities. We view that as one of the arrows that we have in our quiver to serve clients.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: And is it something that you've considered from a corporate standpoint?
Peter Zaffino: Well, yes, I would answer that. I mean, we certainly -- we look at all the different possibilities for our plan. Our plan is not frozen, and we are constantly looking at it to make sure there's a proper balance of risk. So it might be a product we could look at, but I think the way we're handling the plan now is appropriate for us.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Okay. So Dan, I infer from what you're saying. There's really not something terribly new that’s hit the market in the last year or 2 relative to the things that have been available for a while?
Daniel S. Glaser: Well, what you've seen is product innovation, but not new product. And so there's nuance differences between the kinds of products available today and the kinds of products that were available 20 years ago. I think what you're really seeing is the effect of having deep asset reductions and some level of recovery and certain companies staying with that level of recovery that we don't want to have risk of a deep asset reduction again, so let's de-risk our plan.
Operator: And we'll go next to Adam Klauber with William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Mercer, it seemed like most segments the underlying revenue growth was down somewhat from the last couple of quarters. Is that being driven by Europe?
Brian Duperreault: Dan, can you do that?
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, so as you can appreciate, there is some movement around in all of our segments in particular on the Consulting segment from quarter-to-quarter. So when I look at the full year of 2011, I'll start with the basis that we saw a double-digit growth in earnings in the segment and in both Mercer and Oliver Wyman. Specifically, with regard to the fourth quarter, it wasn't abnormal reaction from Europe resulting in the result of it being 2% growth and actually areas that -- for example, retirement, which last year was minus 3% and is minus 1% for the year actually grew 1% in the fourth quarter. So when I look at the drop in sequential growth rate in the fourth quarter, I don't see that as establishing any new kind of trend for Mercer. I would more look at the year, which grew at about 4% as being more indicative of where the business is performing.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Great. And just one quick follow-up. On margins, you showed nice steady progress in both businesses, up 40 basis points. Can we expect nice, steady progress again in 2012?
Brian Duperreault: I would say, Adam, that our primary focus is on growing our net operating income. That's our focus and that's the thesis we put forward at the Investor Day, so that's where we're going. Now, if you look at segments, given our view of 2012, I think that's going to result in margin improvement in both segments. But I got to tell you that to me, the margin is -- it's a result of the work being done to get growth organically in our top line and managing our expenses, and so it's a result, put it that way. We're primarily focused on increasing our income.
Operator: And we will go next to Ray Iardella with Macquarie.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: So I guess a question on M&A. Should we expect, I mean, maybe excluding the Marsh & McLennan Agency strategy and sort of the M&A going forward there, should we expect acquisition going forward to reflect sort of non-U.S. acquisitions as opposed to looking at some M&A in the U.S.?
Brian Duperreault: Not necessarily. No, I mean, we're certainly interested in balancing out geographically. We're balancing out our capability and we're looking for great acquisitions. We're looking for really top-notch companies to join us and maybe in the U.S. it would be nice if they were. So we have a nice pipeline and we'll see where they come from. [indiscernible] emphasis on that geography.
Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then maybe just going back, Brian, to your 4 pillars of success for the company, I mean, you've spent a lot of time talking about revenue growth, controlling expenses and growth in operating income. But I guess could you provide a little bit more color on kind of where the risk profile of the overall organization is? And maybe point to some specific things that you guys have done over the past 1.5 years, 2 years to address sort of the risk profile of the business?
Brian Duperreault: Sure, I'd be happy to. We think the first line of defense is producing a product that's a quality product that's what the client has needed, and then we have agreed to deliver and we deliver that product as promised. And so that means real professionalism in our work. It's attention to detail. It's an operational thing and there's been a lot of work done on both Consulting and Risk and Insurance to improve the way we handle our business processes, our business. It produces efficiencies. It produces better expense levels for us, but it also produces a better-quality product. That's our first line of defense. Our E&O [ph] risks are our largest risks. So a lot of progress there and I think you can -- we'll see it. We can see that in our own results, so without getting into details, we do see that in our levels of activity of issues that we have to deal with. We've de-risked our balance sheet. We've talked a lot about that. That's an important component. We have a lot of cash flexibility, debt flexibility. The other line of defense is really after the fact with the limits of liability and we've -- we were the first to institute limits of liability, and we've got it on both the Consulting and Risk and Insurance now. So I'd say that's been a very successful program for us and I think appropriate for where we are, so -- and there's, I guess, another thing to talk about I probably ought to emphasize is when we're delivering our products, we spend a lot of time in reviewing those, peer reviews to make sure that it is of the highest quality and delivering the promises that we have made to the client. So all of those combined, I think, has delivered a great result and the one thing -- the last thing I want to point out is we redid our code of conduct this year, and that could be a pretty dry thing. We wanted it to be alive, embedded as part of the psyche of the company. We call it The Greater Good. It's something that I'm so proud of and there's a film that we produced around that, I think, is extraordinary. It's won some awards. But most importantly, I think just the way we go about our work now, doing the right thing, producing the business in the best possible way is really part of who we are, part of our culture. So all of those combined, I think, has really taken a big part of the risk of this company out.
Operator: And we will go next to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So Vanessa, one question was on -- you kind of walked through the cash contributions for -- or cash-outs for 2011. I thought that in the K, you’d said you expected to fund $300 million or so in the pension in '11. You didn't mention that. I don't know if that's because those were nondiscretionary contributions or -- if you could help me with that, I'd appreciate it.
Vanessa A. Wittman: Sure, the -- what I called out was specifically the discretionary contributions in 2011. Our contributions to the U.S. and the U.K. plan for the last couple of years have run about $300 million, $320 million. And then on top of that, last year, we had $100 million. I mentioned that we have already committed $100 million of discretionary funding for 2012 and obviously, we'll maintain our flexibility about making further discretionary contributions over time.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then did the pension status factor into your decision not to buy back stock in the fourth quarter? And if it didn't, what drove that decision?
Vanessa A. Wittman: Sure, the pension did not drive the -- have any interplay with the share buyback decision in the fourth quarter. As we've said all along, our share buyback plan and our uses of cash, it will first go to accretive acquisitions. And in the fourth quarter, we had -- we were uncertain of the timing around the closing of the Alexander Forbes transaction, which we had a partial funding of in the fourth quarter, and we'll have the rest of the funding in the first quarter. But that timing was uncertain until very late in the quarter, so we stayed out of the market from a share repurchase perspective.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I see, okay. And then just one follow-up if I could. Maybe Dan or maybe Brian, if you could talk a little bit about just the pipeline in Europe both on the brokerage and Consulting side? And I guess more on the Consulting side. How is that looking today versus the end of the third quarter or late last year?
Brian Duperreault: I want to make sure, the pipeline of what?
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just business activity, so on the Consulting side project.
Brian Duperreault: Business activity? Okay, well, why don't we start with John? He can tell us about Oliver Wyman.
John Drzik: Yes, so on the fourth quarter or the previous earnings call, looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we had signaled that there was some weakness in our European business, particularly, in financial services. I think we see that continuing a little bit into the first quarter of this coming year in 2012. So looking ahead to the whole of 2012, I think we're seeing a macroeconomic environment that's broadly similar to what we saw in 2010 and 2011, and our expectations for our business growth are similar to the last couple of years that we think we'll stay in general on that similar trajectory. Although for the first quarter, in particular, the carryover -- there will be a little bit of carryover from the weakness in Europe in the fourth quarter into the first.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So your baseline there is for Oliver Wyman is an environment in Europe and economic backdrop in Europe that's similar to 2010 and 2011?
John Drzik: I think the global environment and the developed world environment as a whole we're seeing is similar to 2010 and 2011, probably a little stronger in the U.S., a little weaker in Europe, overall the picture for 2012.
Brian Duperreault: Dan can talk about Mercer.
Daniel S. Glaser: Yes, it's kind of interesting in that if you look at our fourth quarter as an example and we look at countries, which had greater than 5% organic growth, you might see some surprises on that list. As an example, Portugal, Italy, Finland, Norway, Spain and Ireland all grew more than 5% in the fourth quarter. So oftentimes, the macro environment, while it may have an impact, it may not appear right away and it may it not be something that is a direct result of, say, macro factors or GDP factors in terms of what is actually driving Mercer’s growth.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And they're also your baseline expectation for Europe is similar as John's, kind of a 2010, 2011 sort of backdrop?
Daniel S. Glaser: I mean, basically, what we try to look at country by country is GDP growth and that our goal is to outgrow GDP. And when we're outgrowing GDP, we think we're doing well. And so when we look at -- as we've done this year, where we've had reasonable growth in both the RIS segment and also in Consulting in Europe, we would expect that to continue.
Operator: We'll go next to Mike Zaremski with Crédit Suisse.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So a little overlap with the prior question, I think. But so for 2012, should we expect outsourcing segment revenue growth to remain weak? And on the other hand, should we expect Talent, Rewards & Communication to remain strong? Any color on those 2 would be helpful.
Daniel S. Glaser: I mean, as we go through our planning and we look forward in the year, bearing in mind we're only in mid-February, and so we're looking out over the whole year. But in terms of what we have seen over the past couple of years, we've seen very strong growth in Talent, Rewards & Communications investments in H&B, some weakness in retirement, which started to abate a little bit by the end of the year, but it's still a tough environment. And with respect to outsourcing, outsourcing was flat in the overall year and as we approach next year, we're hoping to generate low single-digit growth in outsourcing, but it's a competitive environment for a lot of different reasons, and so we're not expecting any kind of significant levels of growth out of outsourcing.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And in talent, rewards, is that coming from a specific sector and/or geography?
Daniel S. Glaser: It's pretty well-spaced geographically. I mean if you take a step back and just think about what are the kinds of concern "C" suites around the world, it tends to be the same things, right? It's a macro factor, it's innovation, it's risks and it's also talent management. There -- even though unemployment levels are high in many countries, the reality is for skilled positions and for critical positions, actually, there's a war for talent out there and so we are -- we advise across the human capital spectrum not only on rewards talent management, which includes everything for paper performance kinds of issues, performance appraisals, colleague engagement surveys of -- compensation surveys broadly, et cetera. So when we look at our Talent, Rewards & Communications segment, there are many sub-segments to it and they're all actually doing quite well.
Michael Zaremski - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay and lastly for Vanessa, just to clarify in your prepared remarks regarding the pension expense, it's $20 million higher in fiscal year 2012 expected versus 2011?
Vanessa A. Wittman: That was the operating income impact, so it is net of bonus, et cetera. It will roll down to $20 million at the operating income level or $0.025 a share.
Operator: And we'll go next to Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: You commented a little bit about the impact of pricing on organic growth. I was wondering if you could just talk about where premium audit sort of stand right now in the comparisons, if there's sort of a flattening out versus a headwind, if they're slightly positive?
Brian Duperreault: Peter?
Peter Zaffino: Yes, I think at this point, there's really no trend. We haven't seen many decreases from any economic conditions and we haven't really seen much in terms of increases from inflation. Certainly, insured values are going up in areas where there's high inflation. But generally speaking, on the portfolio, it's neutral.
Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then could you maybe update us on your growth efforts within the Marsh Agency business, maybe just talk a little bit about deal pipeline, competition for deals, things like that?
Peter Zaffino: Sure. We feel as we've commented in prior quarter's and Dan has in his opening comments that we're very pleased with where we are to date just acquiring Seitlin, again, another geographical expansion with a high-quality agency is another step forward to building out our plans over a 3- to 5-year period. The pipeline is strong, but we're very careful in terms of looking at opportunities that are going to give us a either geographical expansion or a product line expansion. And so I think you can see us continue that pattern over the next 12 to 24 months. Having said all that, we're going to be very careful in terms of what properties we're going to go after. The pipeline is very strong. But again, there's no timeline on when we're going to make these acquisitions.
Brian Duperreault: Good, well, let me wrap this by saying we had an outstanding year last year, an outstanding year. And I want to thank first, take the opportunity to thank our clients for all the business they give us and I very much want to thank all of our talented colleagues out there for your hard work and continued dedication to the company. Thank you very much and thank you for calling in.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Third quarter 2011 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on Marsh & McLennan Companies' website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. In particular, references during this conference call to anticipated or expected results of operations for 2011 or subsequent periods are forward-looking statements, and Marsh & McLennan Companies' actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. Please refer to Marsh & McLennan Companies' most recent SEC filings as well as the company's earnings release, which are available on the Marsh & McLennan Companies' website, for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today.  I'll now turn this call over to Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Please go ahead.
Brian Duperreault: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results as reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and COO, and Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our operating company CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff.  Following my comments, Dan will discuss our operating results in more detail. Vanessa will then update you on our financial position.  Before we begin our discussions of the third quarter, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and thank Michele Burns for her many contributions to our company over the last 5 years. Michele became Mercer’s CEO in 2006 and led Mercer through a period of growth despite severe turbulence in the global economy. Last month, we announced that Michele has accepted a new role: to build and lead a retirement policy center. I believe this center has the potential of making a major contribution toward finding solutions that address the retirement issues facing the United States. I'm excited that Michele has agreed to take on the challenge of leading this effort. We are now searching for a new CEO of Mercer, and until a successor is named, Dan will be overseeing Mercer’s operations.  Now let's move to our third quarter results, which reflect our ongoing strong performance. We generated revenue growth of 11%. On an underlying basis, revenue growth was 5%, and we continued to achieve this growth while maintaining effective control over our operating expenses. This led to an increase in operating income of 30% and growth in adjusted operating income of 18%.  Let's turn to our operating companies. The positive momentum at Marsh continued this quarter, with underlying revenue growth across all geographies driven by higher client revenue retention rates and new business development. Guy Carpenter also generated impressive results, continuing its trend of producing quarterly underlying revenue growth, which has extended over the past 3 years. Mercer produced underlying revenue growth of mid-single-digits as it has over the past year. Oliver Wyman's strong revenue growth continued reflecting broad-based growth across its major industry sectors. So throughout Marsh & McLennan Companies, we've seen revenue increases and higher levels of profitability.  This record of performance is very much in keeping with the goals we articulated at Investor Day in September of 2010. It's now been more than a year since then, so I think it's appropriate to step back and look at the progress the company has made. We're implementing our plan to establish Marsh & McLennan Companies as an elite global growth company, valued by clients, our colleagues and shareholders. We articulated a strategy focusing on 4 pillars: growth in revenue and earnings per share, low capital requirements, high cash generation and reducing the risk profile of the company.  As you look at our performance since Investor Day, the achievements are evident. Over the last 4 quarters, the company has produced underlying revenue growth of 5%, and I'm pleased that each of the operating companies contributed to that achievement. Marsh grew by 5%; Carpenter, 5%; Mercer, 4%; and Oliver Wyman grew 9%. Our goal is to produce underlying revenue growth while maintaining expense discipline, thereby generating at least 10% organic growth and adjusted operating income over the long term.  I'm pleased to report that we are achieving our goals. We have produced revenue growth across the entire enterprise. We have continued to make investments for future growth. And we've done this by limiting -- while limiting our adjusted underlying expense growth to 4%. As a result, I am very pleased that over the last 4 quarters, Marsh & McLennan Companies generated organic growth in adjusted operating income of 13%, an outstanding performance. This earnings growth combined with our dividend yield of 3% is a very attractive result for our investors and in keeping with the goals we articulated at Investor Day more than a year ago.  Additionally, we've continued to maintain low capital requirements and generate high levels of cash. Operational changes throughout the organization, we believe, have lowered the companies' risk profile. Our financial position has strengthened during this period as well, which Vanessa will discuss in a few minutes.  As we move forward, we remain committed to focusing on profitable growth and prudent redeployment of our excess cash flow in order to produce outstanding long-term returns for our shareholders.  With that, let me turn it over to Dan to review our third quarter results in more detail.
Daniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Marsh & McLennan Companies continued its strong performance in the third quarter. We generated underlying revenue growth that have paced consistent with prior periods, with impressive growth in both operating income and adjusted operating income.  Let me go into a little more detail on our operating results. In the third quarter, we achieved revenue growth and increased adjusted operating income at each of our operating companies, as we have for each quarter over the past year. In the quarter, revenue rose 11% to $2.8 billion, while underlying revenue growth was 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 18%.  Risk and Insurance Services revenue was up 11% to $1.5 billion, with underlying revenue growth of 5%. And with ongoing effective expense management, adjusted operating income increased 13% to $186 million. The adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points, reflecting slightly higher margins at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. This is also indicative of the segment's performance year-to-date, where the margin has increased to 19.5% despite the effects of higher pension expense.  Marsh had another strong quarter. Revenue increased 12% to $1.2 billion. Underlying revenue rose 6%. Marsh's high client revenue retention rate and new business development produced underlying revenue growth across all geographies, led by strong growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America of 13%. In the U.S./Canada division, underlying revenue growth was 3% for the fifth consecutive quarter. Marsh has maintained its disciplined expense control, while still being able to invest in the future, refine its operating model and absorb higher severance and pension expense. As a result, Marsh produced double-digit growth in adjusted operating income not just for the quarter, but the year-to-date as well.  In August, we announced a significant expansion of our South African operations with the signing of an agreement to acquire the insurance broking business of Alexander Forbes. The transaction is scheduled to close by year end.  Now turning to reinsurance broking. Guy Carpenter continued to produce strong results. Revenue increased 8% to $251 million with underlying growth of 3%. This growth was led by its international operations, reflecting the successful execution of its long-term business strategy. Over the last 3 years, Carpenter has consistently produced quarterly underlying revenue growth. It has been able to accomplish this through strong new business development and high client retention.  So in summary, both March and Guy Carpenter produced strong financial results not only in the third quarter, but for the 9 months as well.  Turning to our Consulting segment. Our operations continued to generate strong revenue growth. In the third quarter, revenue rose 11% to $1.3 billion with underlying growth of 6%. Growth in adjusted underlying expenses was 5%, which resulted in a 50-basis-point increase in the adjusted operating margin for the quarter. Growth in adjusted operating income was 17% not only for the third quarter, but for the year as well, with both Mercer and Oliver Wyman contributing to this strong growth.  Mercer continued the solid performance we have seen over the past year. Revenue in the third quarter increased 11% to $975 million, and underlying revenue growth was 4%, with all geographic regions contributing to this growth. Consistent with the revenue trends we have seen in Mercer’s lines of business over the past year, retirement saw underlying revenue decline modestly. Health and benefits had a fine performance, with an underlying increase of 7%, driven by strong growth in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. Rewards, talent & communications produced double-digit underlying revenue growth for the fifth consecutive quarter. Outsourcing generated underlying growth of 1%, reflecting growth in Asia Pacific, partially offset by a decline in the United States. And investment consulting & management produced underlying growth of 10%, with strong growth in the U.S. and EMEA.  Oliver Wyman also had a good quarter, with an increase in revenue of 13%. Underlying revenue growth was 9%. This growth was diversified with the strongest growth coming from the health care and consumer industry sectors. Oliver Wyman's expense management also contributed to a solid increase in adjusted operating income.  In summary, we are very pleased with the excellent performance of each of our operating companies, not only this quarter, but throughout the entire year, both from a revenue and earnings growth standpoint.  Now let me make several comments regarding how the increased economic uncertainty that developed in mid-summer, particularly in Europe, may impact our near-term results. Oliver Wyman is our most economically sensitive operating company. We have seen some clients in the financial services sector defer decisions on new engagements, thus making it difficult for Oliver Wyman to generate growth in the fourth quarter, resulting in a modest impact on the segment's profitability. Currently, overall client interest remains high, and the pipeline going into 2012 looks encouraging. However, there is a higher degree of uncertainty. So that's OW.  At Mercer, all signs indicate that the positive trends experienced in the first 9 months of the year are continuing, and we feel that any near-term economic uncertainty is not impacting our Risk and Insurance Services segment. So notwithstanding near-term economic issues, we believe we are on target to have a very successful year and remain optimistic as we develop our strategy and business plans for 2012.  With that, let me turn it over to Vanessa.
Vanessa A. Wittman: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. As you've heard, the strong financial performance of Marsh & McLennan Companies continued in the third quarter. On a GAAP basis, net income was $130 million, or $0.24 per share. Adjusted earnings per share was also $0.24. Costs of $72 million related to the early extinguishment of debt from the tender offer are highlighted on a separate line in this quarter's income statement. This expense is reflected in both our GAAP EPS and our adjusted EPS. I should also note that our a GAAP and adjusted earnings are almost identical for the 9-month period as well. Operating income totaled $1.247 billion, and adjusted operating income was $1.252 billion. As a result, GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations year-to-date was $1.30 and adjusted earnings per share also totaled $1.30.  Now let me add some color regarding other items, including our recent financing activities. In the third quarter, interest expense decreased to $49 million from $60 million a year ago. This level of quarterly interest expense is a reasonable indicator of the run rate we expect going forward. Several actions taken over the past 12 months substantially reduced our interest expense. First was the payment of a $550 million debt obligation in September 2010. Next, in July of this year, we took advantage of the interest rate environment through a tender refinancing effort to extend our maturity ladder and reduce our aggregate interest expense. We had $1.4 billion of debt coming due in 2014 and 2015, and we successfully tendered for $600 million of these bonds. We funded the tender with $100 million dollars of cash and a new 10-year note for $500 million with a coupon of 4.8%. We are very pleased with these transactions, which allowed us to opportunistically refine our capital structure, lower our refinancing risk in the intermediate term, extend maturities of our debt portfolio at a very attractive interest rate and delever our balance sheet. In total, the actions taken over the past year reduce our annual interest expense by $45 million.  Turning to investment income. In the third quarter, investment income was essentially 0 compared with a $2 million loss in last year's third quarter. Due to a decline in the equity markets in the third quarter, we anticipate reporting an investment loss of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter.  Moving on to share repurchase. Since beginning our share repurchase program in last year's fourth quarter, the company has repurchased a total of 15.6 million shares at a cost of $447 million, including 4.4 million shares that were purchased in the third quarter. In August, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program to $1 billion from $500 million.  Looking at taxes. Our adjusted tax rate this quarter increased to 32.7%. This compares with 30.4% in last year's third quarter. A drop in the U.K. statutory tax rate reduced the value of our U.K. net deferred tax assets, which was fully reflected this quarter. This change in the U.K. tax law put upward pressure on our adjusted tax rate in the third quarter but will slightly benefit our overall tax position going forward.  The higher tax rate in the current quarter also reflects a slight shift in the geographic mix of earnings. While there may be volatility in our tax rate from quarter-to-quarter, we still feel that for modeling purposes, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of approximately 31% over the next year.  Due to our high cash generation, we were able to redeploy our cash in the third quarter in a number of ways, including a $126 million per share repurchase, $123 million for dividends, $100 million to reduce long-term debt, $72 million for the early debt repayment and $21 million for acquisitions. This effective redeployment of capital will also contribute to our future growth in earnings per share. And despite all of these actions, our cash position increased $55 million during the third quarter.  Debt at the end of the third quarter was $2.9 billion. We have a $250 million note due March 15, 2012, which is our only debt coming due in 2012.  Last month, we took advantage of favorable conditions in the credit market and were able to close a new $1 billion, 5-year revolving credit facility to replace our existing $1 billion, 3-year credit facility that was due to expire next year. We are very pleased with the increased financial flexibility and reduced uncertainty resulting from the new facilities' extended duration.  With that, I'll turn the call back to Brian.
Brian Duperreault: Thank you, and we're ready for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Keith Walsh from Citi.
Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I guess first question for Dan, just around Consulting. When I think about your comments about Oliver Wyman going into the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit tougher, it seems. Maybe you could talk about that in the context of the margin. It seems Oliver Wyman probably has a lot higher margin with the revenue per head being, I think, double what Mercer is. And if you can kind of also talk in the broader context of just Mercer margins in general. What do you think you can take that to over the next couple of years? It seems your competitors have some much higher targets out there, although they seem to be going backwards at this point. But if you could talk to that.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. So I'll talk for a while, and then John will probably have some comments specific to Oliver Wyman. But in general, we don't disclose margins for individual operating companies. We talk about this segment overall, and so let me just start there. For both Oliver Wyman and Mercer, we believe that, over time, we will be able to expand margins. And so we're very much focused on creating the business disciplines that are necessary in order to be able to commit to that, so that's #1. I'll leave it to John in a second to talk about Oliver Wyman specifically and what he's seeing in the market. In terms of Mercer, I'd start by saying, Mercer is a really strong company. It's large. It's growing. It's globally coordinated. It's profitable. It's got some great people. It's got a great client list. So I've spent a good part of my time in the last 5 months really digging into Mercer, and a lot of what I see, I'm pleased with. My goal is to work with the Mercer leadership team to take all of this and make it better. We can be more global. We can be more profitable with better margins. And we can be more innovative. And so that will be the focus of the leadership team and I over the coming months and years.
John Drzik: So Keith, just to expand a bit on what Dan said in his comments about Oliver Wyman. In August and September, when we were in a period there of tightened economic uncertainty and more market volatility, it resulted in a slowdown in new sales for Oliver Wyman. So while our third quarter results were strong with a 9% growth, that will impact our fourth quarter, and so fourth quarter will be weaker. In particular, the Financial Services sector, especially the banking sector, was where we were experiencing the weakness. And as Dan said, it'll make Q4 challenging one for us. It'll be challenging for us to grow in Q4. Now looking at what recent events mean, in October, sales picked up to back to a normal pace as the market seemed to stabilize. And our client pipeline is encouraging at this point. But obviously, events of this week suggest there could be an extended period of uncertainty, and we could see that coming back in. So I think looking at the medium term, I'd say we're very confident that Oliver Wyman is an attractive growth business and will generate margin growth, as Dan said, over that period. But quarter-to-quarter, we could fluctuate somewhat based on the economic outlook and uncertainty. And obviously, that's, I think, what we'll experience in the fourth quarter this year.
Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then for my second question, it's for Vanessa. Maybe if you could just remind us regarding pension expense, what was the change in the discount rate last year that led to the $12 million quarterly headwind we're seeing now?
Vanessa A. Wittman: Keith, I believe, last year, the aggregate -- because remember, you've got to look across both the U.S. and the U.K. And on a blended basis, it was about a 40-basis-point change, but that's blended. And you've got plans in the U.S. and the U.K. and then the rest of the world where those are individual calcs. And that would have led to our change, which has been about a "$12 million per quarter" impact over the course of the year.
Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just taking that and you got about a 50-basis-point discount rate reduction year-to-date we're looking at in both the U.S. and the U.K., I would assume the impact in 2012 potentially would be of a similar magnitude, ballpark.
Vanessa A. Wittman: As we have said in the past, I know it's tempting at this point in the year and with the volatility that we see in the markets for us to make a call and give you a prediction. But as we've also done in the past, we're not going to give you a prediction. We are very keenly focused on the changes, but it's just not right for a public dialogue. And what you can count on, Keith, is that, as we have done to date, we will -- we're watching it, we're monitoring it and we'll continue to manage the business through next year to deliver on our commitments to our shareholders.
Operator: Moving on, we will take our next question from Brian Meredith from UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Two questions here. First, Vanessa, wondered what the cash position you have right now? Is it possible to give us a sense of kind of what's U.S. versus international? And basically what I'm trying to get at is how much cash is kind of available right now for repurchases?
Vanessa A. Wittman: Well, let me take that 2 ways. The first is that we don't break out our U.S. and international cash, but I think that from our profitability, you could probably safely assume that the bulk of that cash is offshore. And from a repurchase estimation perspective, we've been pretty consistent in saying that our #1 priority is investing in the business with 1a, doing accretive acquisitions. So as you're looking out over the course of the year, we have committed to absorbing in our repurchase what we are issuing from an equities perspective to our colleagues. But I think you should count on the accretive acquisitions and investments in the business first, and we do have an acquisition in the fourth quarter that we expect to close the bulk of that Alexander Forbes acquisition.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then second question, Dan and Peter, I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on the rate environment out there right now, what you all are seeing?
Peter Zaffino: Sure. This is Peter, Brian. The rate environment, you need to take it into geographic locations as well as segments of business. And what we've seen in the third quarter is less of a headwind, so I would say it's been flat to slightly down in our overall portfolio. Peak zones as well as property is starting to firm a little bit more, but I would say it's low to mid-single-digits. We've seen in the U.S. some modest increase in workers' compensation. Having said that, excess casualty and professional lines, we still see rate decreases year-over-year. And then when we look across the world, in other parts of Europe, it still remains flat to down. And again, in other peak zones, perhaps like New Zealand and Japan, we've seen some price increases on property. So it's less of a headwind for us than it was a year ago today, but still I would say it's moderate to -- flat to moderate.
Brian Duperreault: Maybe Alex, you want to comment on the reinsurance side?
Alex Moczarski: Yes, I mean, pretty similar to what Peter said, essentially it varies by geography, it varies by cap zone. Though we've seen in [ph] the U.S. and Canada probably cap somewhere up between 5% to 10%. Obviously, in Japan, some major increases on the cap side. The rest, pretty flat. There's still excess capital in the market despite the sort of different influences from modeling and interest rates and macroeconomic, inflation and so on. We're not advocates of increased rates. We try and get the best deals for our clients. But we still feel that it's hard to gauge, predict the impact going forward.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Larry Greenberg from Langen McAlenney.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Just wondering if you might be able to help us with the impact of foreign exchange on the Risk and Insurance Services margin. And then I think Dan mentioned that you had some severance in there as well, if it's possible to give us some color on that.
Vanessa A. Wittman: Sure. First, on the foreign exchange, it had -- foreign exchange was neutral on our NOI in the Risk and Insurance Services. But if -- just mathematically, if it's neutral at your NOI line, then it's going to have a drag on your margins. So we don't want to really give you any more color than that. And on the severance front, we're not going to break out what the drag in the margins was, but I think that the performance and the margin expansion in that segment is pretty impressive with bearing the FX, the severance and the pension expense.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Okay, fair enough. And then just on the rate environment, appreciated the comments on just the pricing piece of it, but is there any more color you might be able to provide on what's going on, if anything, with terms and conditions? We've heard from some that the excess and surplus lines market is seeing changes with higher retentions, lower limits, some of the standard guys moving away. Any color, perhaps, Peter, that you could provide on that?
Peter Zaffino: Sure. There's not a trend per se on whether it's the E&S market or other terms and conditions getting significantly tighter. I think we've seen through the third quarter releases from insurance companies that we have seen probably a little bit more discipline in the market in terms of looking at -- again, each segment and each line of business and where they think they need rate. So there's different perspectives on lost costs and what's happening with inflation. And I think you're seeing more of a reaction to that than tighter terms and conditions in the E&S market. So I think there really is no specific trend that we saw in the third quarter or that we see really happening in the beginning of the fourth quarter.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Meyer Shields from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Let me start with a couple of numerical questions, if I can. We saw both investment income on fiduciary funds and corporate expenses improve sequentially. And I'm wondering if there's anything unusual in that or whether third quarter is a good run rate?
Brian Duperreault: Vanessa?
Vanessa A. Wittman: Sure, let me take them in pieces. Investment income is separate from fiduciary funds. So in the investment income, we report that on lag, Meyer, and that is invested by a third party. So we don't have good insight into -- we've given you the fourth quarter indication based on the third quarter as reported, but we don't have good insight into where that heads from a run rate perspective.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: No, I was just going to say that I'm focused more on the fiduciary funds.
Vanessa A. Wittman: On the fiduciary funds, it did improve this quarter. And those are funds we manage on behalf of clients. We've been in this bizarre, near 0 interest rate environment. And we do invest those funds within a very narrow and strict policy range to make sure that they're highly liquid, et cetera. It did improve. But I think tracking -- your best indicator there is tracking the overall global interest rate. So we had some volatility in the third quarter that actually benefited us, but rates are back down. Your corporate spreads are up a little bit, which you saw the benefit in the third quarter. And kind of similar to our pension discussion, calling interest rates is not what we want to do. So I would use your best view as the run rate percentage there. And the last part on corporate expenses, you asked for a run rate there. And if you look, there are fluctuations quarter-to-quarter based on investments that we're making. And particularly, we had some changes in the second quarter with welcoming Dan to the corporate center. But I think if you look over the last several years, we have been at about $40 million a quarter for corporate expenses, and that's a decent run rate to use.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And if can follow up real quickly. I know you got permission in 2010 to recollect contingents. And I was wondering that, itself, should play a role in 2012 compared to 2011? Or is everything already fully up and running?
Brian Duperreault: Dan, you want to take that?
Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. I mean, I would think broadly about carrier revenue streams. So when we look at revenue in general, we're looking at negotiating fee increases where we can with our client base. Then when we look at the value that we're adding to carriers, we negotiate where we can higher commission levels, what we called yield. Then we look at areas of fee for services or enhanced commission based upon helping carriers become more efficient. And then we have that minor bit of contingent income, which is largely in the Marsh & McLennan Agency and in some parts of our business where we're actually an MGA. But overall, the negotiation that we have with carriers about levels of income we might receive is about the value that we're providing them, and so that's a continual discussion. It's not something that will stop. That's an every-year thing. And we're building up our capabilities to add more and more value, so we think that we will be able to drive more carrier revenue over time on a multiyear basis.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: First question. Can you talk a little bit about progress within MMC agency and initiatives there this quarter? And I just have one follow-up.
Brian Duperreault: Peter?
Peter Zaffino: Sure. With Marsh & McLennan Agency, we talked about this last quarter as well, we feel very comfortable where we are, about $300 million of revenue in the Marsh & McLennan Agency. Very strong pipeline as we continue to expand out our strategy. There's no time frame in terms of when we want to build it out. But looking at high-quality assets to add into our organization, we think we're probably underweight a little bit in the middle-market space, so we think there's a lot of opportunity to expand. And from a financial standpoint, we're on target in terms of growth and earnings and believe it'll be accretive in the second year, which is a threshold we set for our acquisitions. So overall, we're very pleased. Okay, you had a follow-up?
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Yes, I did have a follow-up. I guess just mentioning 10% operating earnings growth and the expectation there, I know, Vanessa, you mentioned you wouldn't talk about rates and the impact on pension expense, but just kind of given where we are now, is that a goal that you feel like, in this rate environment, is still attainable in the near term?
Brian Duperreault: Well, it's a long-term goal. And long-term goals, you don't get there without going through the near term. The answer is, yes, we believe it's attainable.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jay Gelb from Barclays Capital.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I have 2 questions for you. First, in terms of the potential for margin expansion, I realize there's a number of sort of non-core drag items on margin improvement. But given the strong organic growth profile on revenues, when do you think we'll start seeing it come through in Risk and Insurance Services?
Brian Duperreault: Okay, let me talk about this segment overall. And again, I think margin expansion -- profit growth and margin expansion is both what we're focused on. So when we look at it, and we're in the height of budget season right now and planning for next year and looking at our plans over a number of years, management's drive is how do we create profitable growth for the organization? And we're very comfortable with our strategic positioning. The quality of colleagues, we believe, in the industry leads the insurance business in the Risk and Insurance segment. And so when we look at it, we look at it as each year. We would expect to be able to expand our margins and have profitable growth. Now the fact that we have some headwinds -- and we've already forgotten in some ways about the fiduciary income headwind, but since it came up earlier in the call, I mean, that is a significant amount of money that will eventually, someday, roll back into RIS and, in particular, into Marsh. But we've been managing well through those headwinds, and we will continue to do that. So we will operate our business. As long as we can keep expense growth underneath revenue growth, we will be able to grow profit and improve our margin.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then for Brian, on the pricing side, I'm trying to get your perspective on where do you see the current pace of price improvement, particularly in the U.S. Is this similar to a 1999 and early 2000 level where you saw positive rates of improvement in rates over time and just continue to build momentum?
Brian Duperreault: Well, I'll tell you, it's always tough to make these calls. I've been through a few of these cycles, not too many, because we don't have too many hardening markets. And the strange thing is they're all different. They all start out for different reasons, going in different directions. So it is very hard to say, yes, this is exactly like '99. Things are so much different than they were in '99 today, I mean, economically, globally, all that. But I would say that one of the issues with that period was just kind of an exhaustion that took place, that's the word I've been using, and there was just nowhere else to go with rates except to go back up. And that is the real question that we reached that point. I think you've heard from Peter and from Dan and from Alex that there isn't a real pattern, necessarily, forming yet here. Some ups, some downs, some sideways. Nothing dramatic either way. And so I think this is going to have its own characteristics, and your call is as good as mine on when this all changes. And one day, we'll have answer to this. That's what's great about it.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Adam Klauber from William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: EMEA was clearly a strong point for the quarter. At some point, does that get impacted by weakness in Europe?
Brian Duperreault: Dan?
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Well, it really looks at what segment you're looking at. I think the segment or the area that we would have the most exposure is in Consulting and specifically within Oliver Wyman and in the FS space. That would be where that would most likely come from. We are not seeing, right now, impacts with regard to turmoil in Europe in either our Risk and Insurance Services segment or in Mercer. So logic would tell that, that's probably where we would see it first, but we are not seeing that now.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Great. And one follow-up. Mercer also had strong underlying revenue growth. Is that coming more from new clients? Or more work at existing clients?
Daniel S. Glaser: The answer to that is it's always a mix churn. Mercer has actually very strong new business development over the past couple of years. And so that's certainly a big part of their growth, particularly in areas where we have invested around the world such as health and benefits. If you look at Mercer piece-by-piece, the most significant areas of growth have been in rewards, talent & communications, health and benefits and the investment space. And so all of those areas are actually doing quite well. But I'll just take a moment on rewards, talent & communications because they've had their fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And really, the core bread-and-butter rewards business is very strong across all regions, and that includes consulting and data. The compensation survey business, again, demand is up across all regions. And there's high demand for talent management, specifically leadership development and skills assessment in emerging markets. So we're very well-positioned to capture that trend. And I think at this stage, 5 quarters in a row, you would see that as a trend.
Operator: And our final question comes from Thomas Mitchell from Miller Tabak.
Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: Just noticing that the cost of living seems to be rising while interest rates have stayed very, very low. I'm wondering if this environment is creating challenges for companies that would create new opportunities for your retirement and employee benefits business. And I'm wondering is this more of a sort of a broad picture? Looking at over the next 3 to 5 years, do these factors make a difference or not?
Brian Duperreault: They absolutely make a difference because clients need advice. And when you see changes in the macro environment, when you see legislative change, then that heightens the need for advice. And when we look at our business, whether it's health care legislation or health care delivery changes around the world, retirement as an issue -- retirement, we don't expect that retirement is a declining business. We know that the revenue has been in decline for the last number of quarters last year and this year. But fundamentally, we believe clients need solutions and that we are very well-positioned to invent solutions and innovate for our clients. And so we're working hard at doing that now.
Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: Okay, well, let me ask you just a slightly different issue. Life insurance companies who, to some extent, compete -- at least compete with your products in some ways, and in other ways they're suppliers of products -- have been in a relatively difficult period with respect to various kinds of guaranteed contracts, including guarantees that are associated with the variable annuity contracts. Does that drive a number of customer inquiries about changing their plans? Or is what I'm really referring to much more of an individual -- purchase by individual market?
Brian Duperreault: I think, well, one, our business is generally a B2B and also B2B2C, so we're not really in the B2C direct space on things like annuities or life insurance sales. So we're talking to companies. Our dialogue with life insurance companies is around we all believe that annuities provide part of the answer, and perhaps even annuities linked with long-term care are interesting products, and we all are surprised at the lack of take-up. And so there's, I think, a lot of interest around greater product in an annuity kind of format. And for companies to look at how they can support that for their colleague base, particularly if they've moved from DB to DC. But the life insurance companies themselves would say it has not been a tremendously active market. So let me close by thanking our 52,000 employees. They have delivered another outstanding quarter, and I'm grateful to you for all that you do, your dedication and commitment to driving the company forward. And I'm honored to serve as your CEO. Thank you to everybody. And goodbye.
Operator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation today.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Marsh & McLennan Companies' Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Second quarter 2011 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on Marsh & McLennan Companies’ website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. In particular, references during this conference call to anticipated or expected results of operations for 2011 or subsequent periods are forward-looking statements, and Marsh & McLennan Companies' actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. Please refer to Marsh & McLennan Companies' most recent SEC filings, as well as the company's earnings release, which are available on the Marsh & McLennan Companies' website, for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I will now turn the conference over to Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Brian Duperreault: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results as reported earlier today. I am Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me and presenting on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; and Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs, Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter, Michele Burns of Mercer and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff. Following my comments, Dan will discuss our operating results in more detail. Vanessa will then update you on our financial position.  Let me begin by saying our second quarter results were outstanding and illustrate the excellent progress we have made over the past year. We reported a strong increase in revenue with growth of 12%, and growth was 5% on an underlying basis for the second quarter in a row. In fact, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that each of our operating companies produced revenue growth on both a reported and an underlying basis. And we continue to achieve this growth while maintaining control over our operating expenses. As a result, we produced strong growth in adjusted operating income. In the first 6 months of this year, underlying revenue growth of 5% and adjusted underlying expense growth of 4% produced 13% growth in adjusted operating income, an excellent first half of the year.  The positive momentum at Marsh continued this quarter with underlying revenue growth driven by strong new business development and increased client revenue rates. Guy Carpenter also produced excellent underlying revenue growth as it has for 10 straight quarters. Mercer generated an underlying revenue growth of mid-single digits for the fourth consecutive quarter, and Oliver Wyman’s string of solid revenue growth continued, driven by Financial Services, its largest industry sector. So as we look across the breadth of the company, we're very pleased with the performance of every one of our operating companies.  As you've heard me say a number of times since our Investor Day last September, our plan is to establish Marsh & McLennan Companies as an elite business enterprise, valued by our clients, our colleagues and our shareholders. And we have articulated our growth strategy that will guide us in realizing this aspiration. Our strategy focuses on the characteristics that create exceptional value and superior returns for investors: sustained long-term growth in revenue and earnings per share, low capital requirements, high cash generation and reducing the risk profile of the company. Some of these pillars are interrelated. For example, our positive cash flow has allowed us within the past several quarters to increase our dividend, make attractive acquisitions and institute a share repurchase program. Our excess cash also allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet, which lowers the risk profile of the company.  Another example of how we're evolving into an elite organization is the articulation to our colleagues throughout the world of our corporate philosophy, which we refer to as The Greater Good. This philosophy is designed to assist our colleagues with respect to the legal, ethical and risk issues that may arise in the course of doing business. This enhanced approach reinforces our business standards as we operate globally. As part of this effort, we produced a documentary to creatively represent the essence of our corporate philosophy. We encourage you to visit our website to learn more about The Greater Good and to view the 4-minute trailer for the award-winning film entitled, Faces of Marsh & McLennan.  So you see we take very seriously the 4 pillars we presented to the investment community 10 months ago. Not only are we producing strong results, we are implementing a variety of initiatives to better position the company for growth.  In summary, our excellent performance in the first half of the year demonstrates the type of performance the senior leadership is striving for. Sustaining this performance over the long term should translate into outstanding results for our shareholders.  And with that, let me turn it over to Dan to review our second quarter results in more detail.
Daniel Glaser: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to talk to you about the outstanding financial performance of our operating companies in the second quarter. First, let's go into a little more detail on our consolidated operating results. We achieved solid revenue growth and increased adjusted operating income at each of our operating companies for the fourth consecutive quarter. This quarter, revenue increased 12% to $2.9 billion, and underlying revenue growth was 5%. We also produced a robust increase in adjusted operating income of 17%.  Risk and Insurance Services revenue increased 11% to $1.6 billion with underlying revenue growth of 5%. Continued expense discipline held adjusted underlying expense growth to 3%. Adjusted operating income increased 16% to $352 million with Marsh and Guy Carpenter both contributing double-digit growth. And the adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 21.7%, reflecting higher margins at both operating companies. For the first half of the year, the adjusted operating margin for the segment increased slightly despite the effects of higher pension expense and the negative impact of foreign currency translation.  Marsh had another strong quarter any way you look at it. Revenue increased 12% to $1.4 billion, and underlying revenue rose 5% marking the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Every one of Marsh's major geographic operations experienced underlying revenue growth in the quarter with particularly strong growth of 18% in Latin America. In fact, throughout Marsh's global operations, 27 countries produced underlying revenue growth that exceeded 10%. Additionally, U.S. Canada generated revenue growth of 3% for the fourth consecutive quarter. On a year-to-date basis, Marsh's growth rate swung by 500 basis points compared with the first 6 months of last year, an impressive performance considering market conditions. Global new business development continues to be strong. In the second quarter, Marsh's new business was up 8% on an underlying basis with similar growth in both its U.S./Canada and international operations. For the first 6 months, Marsh generated over $500 million in new business. And with disciplined expense control, the result is double-digit growth in adjusted operating income, not just for the quarter but the year-to-date as well.  Now turning to reinsurance broking. Guy Carpenter continues to build on last year's very strong performance. Revenue was $257 million, reflecting the underlying growth of 5% led by global specialties, Latin America, Continental Europe and U.S. facultative reinsurance broking. Guy Carpenter had particularly solid revenue growth from sales of its new CWILP or county weighted index loss product. Over the last 2.5 years, Carpenter has produced 10 consecutive quarters of underlying revenue growth. It was able to accomplish this through continuing strong new business development and very high client retention. So in summary, Marsh and Guy Carpenter both produced strong financial results not only in the second quarter but throughout the first half of this year.  Turning to our Consulting segment. I am pleased that our Consulting operations continued to generate strong revenue growth as well. In the second quarter, revenue rose 13% to $1.3 billion with underlying growth of 5%. Growth in adjusted underlying expenses was 4%. Adjusted operating income increased 21%, and year-to-date growth was 17%. And the Consulting adjusted margin rose 80 basis points in the current quarter. The impact of higher pension expense in the quarter was offset by a benefit from foreign currency translation.  Mercer had a strong second quarter. Mercer's revenue increased 13% this quarter to $945 million, and underlying revenue growth was 4%. Mercer continued the solid performance we have seen over the past year. Within Retirement, growth in the U. K. and Latin America was offset by declines in the U.S. and Ireland. Health and Benefits continued its good performance with growth in all regions of the world and particular strength in the U.S., Latin America, Canada and Asia-Pacific. Rewards, Talent and Communications produced double-digit revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Outsourcing's underlying growth of 2% primarily reflected growth in Australia, partially offset by a decline in the U.S. The 13% underlying revenue growth in investment consulting and management continued a trend that is extended for more than a year. Mercer has assets under management of $44 billion as of June 30. And Mercer produced margin improvement and double-digit growth in adjusted operating income.  Oliver Wyman also had an excellent quarter, continuing to produce strong revenue growth with an increase of 14%. On an underlying basis, its growth was 8%, which represents Oliver Wyman's sixth consecutive quarter of high single-digit revenue growth, an impressive performance. In the latest quarter, Oliver Wyman's growth was diversified with strong growth from its largest industry sector, Financial Services. It also had solid growth from the healthcare, manufacturing and transportation industry sectors. Oliver Wyman's close management of operating expenses also contributed to double-digit growth in adjusted operating income with a healthy increase in its margin.  So in summary, we are very pleased with the performance of each of our operating companies, not only this quarter but also over the first 6 months of the year. In aggregate, our operating companies produced adjusted income growth of 17% for the quarter and 13% for the first half of the year, an excellent performance.  Now let me turn it over to Vanessa.
Vanessa Wittman: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. As Brian and Dan have indicated, the financial performance at Marsh & McLennan Companies in the second quarter was very strong. We produced earnings per share of $0.50 in the second quarter on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. And despite the year-over-year decline in investment income of $24 million or $0.03 per share, the increase in adjusted EPS was 9%. We anticipate investment income in the third quarter to be a slight loss, similar to the third quarter of 2010. In the second quarter, net interest expense decreased to $44 million from $57 million a year ago. This was due to a slight increase in interest income and a substantial decrease in interest expense resulting from the payment of a $550 million debt obligation last September.  On last quarter's call, we indicated we would be active in the second quarter with share repurchases. I'm pleased to report we aggressively resumed our buyback program with the repurchase of nearly 8 million shares for $235 million. Combined with our buyback activity in last year's fourth quarter, we've used $320 million of our $500 million authorization, repurchasing a total of 11.2 million shares. We plan to continue repurchasing our stock in the third quarter.  When we analyzed our debt portfolio at the beginning of the year, we felt some changes would be warranted if market conditions afforded us an opportunity. In the second quarter, we took advantage of a significant decline in 10-year corporate rates by tendering for a portion of our debt obligations. Although we have small amounts due in 2012 and 2013, we chose to address the spike in our maturity ladder in 2014 and '15 when an aggregate of $1.4 billion was coming due within a 14-month period. In June, we initiated a tender offer for $250 million each of the 2014s and '15s. The tender was oversubscribed, and in July, we reduced the $1.4 billion spike by $600 million. We brought in $330 million of the $650 million due in 2014 and $270 million of the $750 million maturing in 2015.  Given our strong cash position, we funded the tender with $100 million of cash and a new issue 10-year note for $500 million. The coupon on the new note is 4.8%. Costs of $73 million related to the early extinguishment of the debt from the tender offer will be recognized in the third quarter. We are very pleased with these transactions, which have lowered our refinancing in intermediate-term by extending our maturities at a very attractive interest rate. Additionally, we'll see a reduction in our annual interest expense of $9 million.  Our tax rate in the second quarter was 31%, reflecting our geographic mix of earnings. We continue to expect that the tax rate for the year will be approximately 31%. Quarter end cash was $1.7 billion compared with $1.5 billion a year ago. Debt at the end of the second quarter was $3 billion. Net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents, was $1.4 billion compared with $2.1 billion at the end of the second quarter of last year.  In summary, our financial position has continued to strengthen over the last 12 months. We prudently used the current environment of low interest rates to opportunistically reconfigure our capital structure, extend maturities of our debt portfolio, delever our balance sheet, trim ongoing interest expense and reduce our intermediate-term refinancing risk.  With that, I'll turn the call back to Brian.
Brian Duperreault: Thank you, Vanessa, and now, we're ready for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: Brian, the first question, I guess, for you is given all the uncertainty right now from a global perspective, what are you seeing in your business trends? And is there any concern here going forward that maybe you'll see a slowdown in business trends because of the global economy?
Brian Duperreault: It's interesting, Brian. We were talking about that just recently as of yesterday because we do think about these things. And I'll give you my overview, but I think maybe the guys could talk about it individually, what they're seeing in their own operations. And I would start by saying, Brian, that's something we don't have control over, but we do have control over how we operate, and that's the whole point of keeping control on both sides. So we’ve done a pretty good job of growing this business in difficult times and maintaining expense. And so frankly, I don’t worry about it too much, but I don't think we're seeing the signs that seem to be in the headlines every day. In our underlying basis -- our underlying business looked pretty good going forward. So let me start with John because I think the Consulting side would be the place where you would see it the most. John?
John Drzik: Brian, our pipeline, business pipeline still looks good. Obviously, there's lots of concerning news out there as you referenced with the sovereign debt crisis and the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations and some weak macroeconomic news. But to date, we’ve found that business confidence has been pretty resilient, and our clients are still investing in their businesses, so demand for Consulting has been pretty robust. If we look at our recent sales between, say, April and July and run up to now, they've been strong. Our forward-looking pipeline is good. So there's no immediate warning signs in our business. We obviously need to monitor it closely. But at this point, we'd expect to stay on a growth trajectory similar to what we have been.
Brian Duperreault: And Michele, on the Mercer side?
M. Burns: I concur with what John said. The pieces of our business that usually are the early warning signs of trouble or of good opportunity, we’ve seen great growth. Double-digits in talent and rewards, obviously investments pillar is growing at 13%. So we have seen no signs of our clients slowing down. In fact, they are investing in the pieces of the business that they typically invest in when they are planning for growth. The second thing I'd say is the environment has afforded us an opportunity to do some tuck-in acquisitions, and so we've done 3 tuck-in acquisitions this year that have been very opportunistic and have been very, very low risk [indiscernible] will enable us to grow both organically and inorganically.
Brian Duperreault: Does that help, Brian?
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: Yes, that's helpful. Just one quick follow-up question here. Dan, you mentioned that, I guess, FX benefits to offset tension expense. What was the benefit to FX in the quarter from an earnings perspective?
Brian Duperreault: I don't mind Dan answering.
Vanessa Wittman: I'll be happy to take it. So Brian, in the quarter, we had a slight benefit from FX, and year-to-date, we're neutral. And over the course of the year, as always, the FX impact is de minimis. But if you think about the pension impact, which we've given guidance for, is roughly $12 million a quarter and 2/3 of that in the RIS segment, there's a drag there that's offset. I would point out that FX on a margin perspective for RIS is a drag. So you've got a double drag on your margins in RIS, one from pension and the second from FX.
Operator: That will come from Cliff Gallant of KBW.
Cliff Gallant - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: Regarding acquisitions, particularly in the brokerage side of the business, there's been a lot of talk in the marketplace that perhaps pricing is improving or at least bottoming, and I'm curious as to how that might be affecting expectations on the seller side of whether or not they're willing to sell at this point or what kind of valuations they would want?
Brian Duperreault: Thanks, Cliff. Well, Peter, you're in it, so why don't you tell us all about it?
Peter Zaffino: Yes, there's a fair amount activity on the acquisition side. Don't think that the underlying macroeconomic factors or pricing are playing into it for us to much. We have a very strong strategy on Marsh & McLennan agency. And we're about $300 million in size, and so we're looking for strategic acquisitions that fit in with what our vision is for the MMA. And we also have an acquisition strategy to complement what our current portfolio looks like either from a segmentation or geographical standpoint. So while there's activity, we will absolutely stick to our strategy and drive growth in acquisitions that fit what we've outlined in the past.
Operator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I don't know if this is a Michele or a Vanessa question, but I'm hoping to get a sense as to which currencies are driving the benefit for FX in terms of Consulting revenues.
Vanessa Wittman: Sure, Meyer, I'm going to take that one. So if you think about our 4 major currencies, the euro, the pound, the Canadian dollar and the Aussie dollar, they've all strengthened against the U.S. dollar both for the quarter and over the first half of the year. We had a little volatility in the January side of FX, the January renewals on the RIS side. But in Consulting, as we've mentioned, it's a very minor benefit for both the quarter and for year-to-date.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And if I can follow that up, I guess this is more of an RIS question. Is the price that you're charging whether it's on a commission or a fee basis, is there any gap between where it should be at this point in time and where it actually is?
Brian Duperreault: That's interesting. Anybody want to take that question? Dan?
Daniel Glaser: I'll take it. I would phrase it more along the lines of when we look at whether we're compensated by either commission or fee, it’s about what value we create. And I believe that over the past several years, our value has increased, both to our clients and also to the insurance companies we deal with. So I would say that there is a delta between the value, the additional value we've created and the income we're receiving for that value. And obviously, we work on closing that delta.
Operator: And that will come from Matthew Heimermann of JPMorgan.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I guess this question is probably either for Peter or Dan. Just with respect to the U.S. and Canada, retention still seems to be kind of a positive tailwind for you. I was curious if you could just give us a little bit more insight into how much of that is kind of the retention improvement of the last several years, just trying to get back to normal and then whether or not there's any incremental pickup you're seeing whether it be from value, service, what have you?
Brian Duperreault: This is in client retention?
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Correct.
Brian Duperreault: So Peter, why don't you do it? And then maybe Dan might have his own insights.
Peter Zaffino: Okay, sure. Actually, the client retention in the U.S. has remained very stable. It's been very strong. We saw evidence of that in the second quarter as well, so we have actually had a pretty stable of the last 6 quarters in the U.S. The growth has come from strong new business. U.S. had a very robust new business quarter in the second quarter. As a matter of fact, for the overall organization of Marsh, this is the second best quarter we've had in the last 5 years in new business. So it's a combination of very strong retentions, although I think they've remained fairly stable. We have had strong new business and really are executing much better than we have in the past. This is something that's been an evolution process. But Dan's leadership from 18 to 24 months ago of implementing winning at Marsh has derived a much stronger pipeline for us. And we've been focusing on really driving value, as you mentioned before. So it's a combination of all factors that have given us the 500-basis-point lift over the first 6 months of 2011.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: So just to summarize, I guess, so we're past the point of year-on-year retention gains helping the growth rate in the U.S. and Canada. We're now at a point where just the absolute retention ratio is so strong with the business levels you’re getting, that's really leading to pretty attractive organic?
Brian Duperreault: Dan?
Daniel Glaser: Yes, that is a good summary, but I just want to make sure that we separate client retention and revenue retention. So from a client retention standpoint, our client retention levels have fully recovered from our dark period and, in fact, have stabilized from multiple quarters ago, 5 or 6 quarters ago. But our client retention levels are as good as they've ever been. On a revenue retention basis, you benefit from exposure changes, from some stabilization of the cycle and also from our answer to the previous question, our creation of additional value for our clients. And we seek to monetize that additional value creation through either higher fees or higher commissions. So all of those factors benefit revenue retention.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess, maybe for Vanessa, maybe for Michele or John, but just with the 4% underlying expense growth in the Consulting segment, can you give us a sense of what that's comprised of? How much of it is compensation? How much of it is G&A or other investment expense in the business?
Brian Duperreault: Okay, why don't we have -- I think Michele and John should answer that. So why don't we have Michele talk about Mercer first?
M. Burns: Well, I think there's some compensation expense increase as a result of the prices that go into effect in the first quarter, so you're lacking some quarters. The second piece is I think we're really investing in some professionals inside the business. So as we went through 2009 and into 2010 in the first half, we had not built for the robustness of certain of the businesses sort of growing in double-digits, as well as importantly the Health and Benefits business that is showing nice consistent strong growth around the world. So there's been some increase in numbers of people, as well as a little -- a smaller increase in compensation. So the rest of expenses are not necessarily growing in any way disproportionate to the business itself. That's the balance I would say -- where you see the expense growth in Mercer, it is investing in the products and services almost exclusively.
Brian Duperreault: Good. John?
John Drzik: Our primary expense is compensation, so the noncomp expenses would probably be growing slower overall than revenues. The comp would be growing closer to revenues. And as with Michele, a part of it reflects investment in new professionals, so we are growing the overall staff capacity in the business in response to the revenue growth. And a part of it would reflect productivity increase, which results in higher compensation for those who are producing the greater productivity. So I think it's a mix of those, but we're continuing to run with a positive gap between revenue and expenses.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay, that's helpful. And in terms of just how we should think about the timeline of the investments going forward in people?
Brian Duperreault: Let me jump in there. For us, I mean, what we sell is our expertise, and that's person-by-person. So as we see opportunities, we're going to bring in the best people we can. So I think they'll go hand-in-hand, but we will get productivity out of them, and the net result is a very positive operating income growth. So that's kind of what you should see from us. We tend to think very positively about the future and the growth potential and, therefore, positively about expanding our personnel.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: That makes sense. I just wanted to make sure it wouldn't be a mischaracterization to suggest that given 6, 8 quarters ago, we were in a much different growth environment. There's probably been somewhat of a ramp-up with the pickup in growth, and that very well could level off as organic growth, even if it’s at these levels, obviously, may not be accelerating [indiscernible] in the past...
Brian Duperreault: Yes, I guess, what we're really concerned about in the Great Recession period was reducing too deeply our capabilities, and I think we did a pretty good job at that. So the ramp-up wasn't maybe as large as you might think because we were pretty good at holding the people we needed to hold. So I think it's now, it's going to be proportional.
Operator: That will come from Keith Walsh of Citi.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: Two questions. First for Vanessa and just some numbers around margins, I mean, you guys are probably the only public broker that's really going to grow margins this quarter, and you have headwind that others don't. So maybe if you could -- by my math, the pension headwind’s at least 70 bps. Can you give us the numbers, what's the FX headwind you had on the margin? And were there any other severance costs in there because you guys have done -- you've been hiding those severance costs and not taking them out of your P&L, maybe if you can give us a little color on that?
Vanessa Wittman: I'd rather say we're absorbing the severance cost than hiding the severance cost. But if you aggregate the headwinds that we're seeing in the margin, in the RIS margin, it's about 70 basis points from FX. You are directionally correct on the pension, and we're probably bearing another 15 to 20 basis points of other headwinds in the margins.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: Okay. So growth even better than the 100 that you’ve put out there. And then the second question, just for Brian and/or Vanessa, just a philosophy on the capital structure. I mean, you guys have been actually reducing debt, and most of your competitors out there prefer to run with a much higher debt-to-EBITDA level than you guys are well below what everyone else is. So what's the philosophy there and why -- I guess, it's a high-class question, a high-class problem, why are you running so low compared to everyone else?
Brian Duperreault: Yes, I don't know what everyone else is thinking, so let me just tell you what we're thinking. My 4 pillars include that risk thing and capital management flexibility. So my feeling is -- and I told you I'm very positive, right, very positive about what's going forward. But I want to hedge my bets a little bit here. So we want to manage the balance sheet so that we have a very prudent level of debt, which we could expand if necessary and add for opportunity reasons or because something goes wrong, we don't know about. So I like the position we're in. I mean, we're expanding our margin. We're growing the business. We're keeping faith with what we put forward at Investor Day 10 months ago about the 10%-plus growth rate. And so to be able to maintain the balance sheet at the level we have and do that, I think is great for all of us because it gives us tremendous financial flexibility, and that's what I'm trying to get. So I like to be in a position where we can be very agile if necessary. And we're still buying back shares, and we're doing other things we need to do. So that's kind of where I'm coming from. Does that help, Keith?
Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: Yes, that’s great.
Operator: We'll go next to Yaron Kinar of Deutsche Bank.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG: I have a couple of questions. One, with regards to RIS. Can you talk a little bit about your efforts vis-à-vis the enhanced commissions and maybe particularly how they kind of fit in, in an environment where you see increase competition, where exposure growth has been slow. How were you able to achieve that?
Brian Duperreault: Could you just -- what was that second question?
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: That was actually the first question.
Brian Duperreault: Okay, it was including net spend. Okay, good. So, Peter?
Peter Zaffino: I think again there's not going to be much change in my answer from what Dan's answered in prior quarters, but enhanced commissions for us are about working with enormous transparency. We work with carriers for fee-for-service in terms of value that we provide for the carriers, Marsh Market Connect is a great example of that. We have expanded enhanced commissions that are disclosed to our clients. And then also embedded within our numbers is increased yield, which is just getting more commission on placements, again, with transparency to clients. So I think all of those initiatives that have been going on for some time have still been reflected in the second quarter and something that, again, it's not material in terms of the change for the overall numbers but has been a slight positive in the quarter.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. And you're able to achieve that despite the fact competition for this business is increasing in a kind of a stagnant exposure environment?
Peter Zaffino: Yes, the competition is, as you've outlined, still very competitive, but this is all about a value proposition that we provide to insurance companies, and so again, it's a separate revenue stream that is not linked to volume. It's not linked to anything other than value that we're providing to clients again with a lot of transparency and to carriers.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG: Got it. And the second question probably for Michele, with regards to the Rewards, Talent, Communications, can you shed some light maybe on how you've been achieving the double-digit organic growth? It's now 4 consecutive quarters of that, even though employment levels remain pretty sluggish, and the economy is still not really as robust as one would have hoped?
M. Burns: Sure. Glad to do that. I think we will see that segment of our business continue to grow strongly, and the reason is because of the demographic shifts that are occurring in the world. And in these major developed countries in particular, we see that while we have unemployment rolls that do not seem to be lessening, we have clients that have a need for skilled labor and not enough people who have those skills, so they're competing significantly for talent and engineering and executive ranks, et cetera. So the strategy they need to have on a broad base to retain major groups of employees is quite significant. So I think you will see that continue because demographic trends will not abate in this area, and that presents major opportunities for us [indiscernible] over those issues in the years to come.
Operator: That will come from Michael Nanitsi [ph] of Goldman Sachs.
Unknown Analyst - : Just a question for Vanessa on the debt, quick one, are you going to include that refi charge in -- or are you going to include or exclude in next quarter's earnings -- or adjusted number, I should say?
Vanessa Wittman: It will be a separate line item, but it will be included. That's why we wanted to point out the size of the charge so that you could bake that into your third quarter outlook.
Unknown Analyst - : Got it. And then just want to see -- understand how you're thinking about -- so $9 million a year benefit from lower interest expense I think it is what you said. Is that right?
Vanessa Wittman: Yes.
Unknown Analyst - : And then it was a $73 million cost?
Vanessa Wittman: Sure, let me break it down because it is -- if you think about the bonds, the 2014s and '15s were trading at that time, there were $62 million of embedded premium in where they were trading. So you're going to pay that one way or another, right? So the true cost, the way we look at it is there was a $7.5 million charge for the incremental premium, about 10 basis points on one issue and 15 on the other, to tender for the bonds to bring them in. There's $7.5 million there and $1.5 million of dealer fees. So it was, really, from a true charge perspective, it's a $9 million cost. And we get a $9 million recurring benefit.
Unknown Analyst - : I see. So the $73 million is because you paid higher than par on the Retirement?
Vanessa Wittman: Right, they're both trading above par, right? So you’ve got to pay at least market and then a small market premium to bring them in.
Unknown Analyst - : Got it. Okay. So is it fair -- when thinking about that to think about the $9 million in terms of savings versus -- when you're deciding whether or not you're going to manage this end of your balance sheet, do you think about the cost to retire versus the benefit you get, and is the difference the premium you ascribe to reducing your exposure to liquidity in '14 and '15, for example?
Vanessa Wittman: It's a couple of things. First of all, we were looking out and saying in today's interest environment to be able to print a 4.8% coupon bond was an opportunity we didn't want to miss when we're looking out and saying in '14 and '15, you got $1.4 billion due in 14 months, which -- the biggest driver here was knocking that spike down and being able to push it out for 5 and 6 more years. And then coupled with a dramatically lower interest rate for the 10 years that we have seen over the course of the last few years.
Unknown Analyst - : Okay. That helps. And if I could, one quick one on the Guy Carp side, any commentary on cap bond issuance this quarter and how’s that business -- how’s Guy Carp’s business there performing?
Brian Duperreault: Alex , please?
Alex Moczarski: It's performing well, and there is increased demand. Also, as we've mentioned before on the CWILP, we've seen increased demand. We’ve actually issued more in the first half than we did in the last 2 years, so activity is good.
Operator: We'll go next to Thomas Mitchell of Miller Tabak.
Thomas Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC: Just sort of a minor housekeeping question, which is you didn't have any restructuring charges to speak of this quarter. Should we anticipate that the restructuring period is now officially ended?
Brian Duperreault: Officially ended. Well, I'll put it this way. We had quite a bit of work to do over the last several years to position the company properly, certainly in risk and insurance but secondarily in Consulting given economic conditions. We've done that. I mean, we are thinking about growth -- but look, we're always looking, and we're always trying to improve the structure. And if we found things that needed to be done that required restructuring, we would do them. But our plan is to take what we have now and really grow this company.
Operator: We'll go next to Jay Gelb of Barclays Capital.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: In the Risk and Insurance Services segment, adjusted margins are largely unchanged year-over-year. And I'm just trying to get a sense of whether you feel organic revenue growth can outstrip organic expense growth for your year?
Brian Duperreault: Dan?
Daniel Glaser: Sure. I mean, one, I would start by saying that our adjusted margins in the second quarter in RIS are about 100 basis points above prior. You may be referring through the first 6 months of the year, and on that basis, we're slightly ahead on adjusted margin basis, and it's what -- we would be reasonably ahead if not for the headwinds of pension and foreign exchange. In terms of what we can do in the future, I mean one part of my new role has really been digging into each of our businesses and look at what our strategies are, what our organic strategies are, what the pipeline looks like for acquisitions and what kind of efficiencies we can seek. And I'm very happy to say that in our collective view, there's plenty of opportunity for us over the next several years to not only increase our earnings but to expand our margins in both segments.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Okay. And then, separately on the share buyback trend, how would it work out if there were to be a new repurchase authorization put in place? Would that have to go to the board and potentially what time frame could that take place in?
Brian Duperreault: Jay, yes, the board approves these things. We would recommend it. We have expressed to you and all of the investment community that the share buybacks are part of our capital management on a going-forward basis, particularly as we continue to grow good positive cash, but it is a board decision, and the board will decide when it decides. I can’t tell you anything more than that.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: I mean, there’s no -- it's not like it has to happen at a certain time in the year, right?
Brian Duperreault: No, you could do it tomorrow, I mean. But the board has its scheduled meetings and things like that. But yes, I mean, it's not a seasonal thing.
Operator: There are no other questions at this time.
Brian Duperreault: Well, listen, thank you very much for joining us. We had an outstanding quarter, and that's all because of the hard work of all of our colleagues around the world, and I want to thank them, terrific job. See you next quarter.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. First quarter 2011 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on Marsh & McLennan Companies' website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, in particular, references during this conference call to anticipated or expected results of operations for 2011 or subsequent periods are forward-looking statements and Marsh & McLennan Companies' actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. Please refer to Marsh & McLennan Companies' most recent SEC filings, as well as the company's earnings release, which are available on the Marsh & McLennan Companies' website for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Please go ahead, sir.
Brian Duperreault: Thank you. Good morning. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results as reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me and presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. Also I'd like to welcome Dan Glaser, Group President and Chief Operating Officer of Marsh & McLennan Companies; as well as our operating companies CEOs, Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Michele Burns of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff. Our first quarter results show that we're off to a very good start this year. We reported a strong increase in revenue with growth of 9%. In fact, this is the third consecutive quarter that each of our operating companies produce revenue growth on both a reported and on underlying basis. And importantly, we can continue to achieve revenue growth while maintaining effective control over operating expenses. As a result, we produced 10% growth in adjusted EPS for the quarter, a solid start for the year. The positive momentum at Marsh continued with good underlying revenue growth, fueled by new business development and high client revenue retention rates. Guy Carpenter also produced excellent quarterly underlying revenue growth, as it has for more than 2 years now led by its international operations. Mercer generated underlying revenue growth of mid-single digits for the third consecutive quarter. And Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth was its strongest since 2007. So we're very pleased with our operating performance in the first quarter. I'd now like to expand on some recent management changes at the company. The 4 pillars I discussed in Investor Day last September are the foundation for Marsh & McLennan Companies to produce outstanding performance on a long-term basis, re-establishing us as a global growth company. Our strategy focuses on the characteristics that create exceptional value and superior returns for investors, long-term growth, low capital requirements, high cash generation with disciplined capital management and low risk profile. Based on our strong performance last year and our excellent start this year, I am confident that the turnaround we began 3 years ago is complete. Now that we've managed effectively through the great recession and each of our businesses is on an upward trajectory, I thought it was an opportune time to make changes to our leadership structure. These changes further enhance our strong management team by providing expanded responsibilities and broadened scope for certain key executives. This will allow them to utilize their unique perspectives to further refine our operating model, while at the same time maintaining the continuity and strong cohesive working relationship among the senior management team. So as we announced last month, Dan Glaser is named Group President, Chief Operating Officer of Marsh & McLennan Companies. We believe his appointment will accelerate our progress towards growth in revenue and profitability across all our operating companies, and sharpen our focus as an organization. As you know, Dan is a seasoned executive with 30 years’ experience in the insurance business, including senior management positions both as a broker and as an underwriter. In his newly created role, Dan will have operational and strategic oversight of our 4 operating companies as well as certain functional areas. Under Dan's leadership, Marsh dramatically improved profitability and performance. And we have every confidence that he brings the same leadership qualities, strategic thinking and operational excellence to his new role. Peter Zaffino is named CEO of Marsh. One of the best decisions I made when I joined Marsh & McLennan was to name Peter as CEO of Guy Carpenter in early 2008. During his tenure, Peter built and led a team that significantly improved performance, solidified Guy Carpenter's standing as one of the world's leading reinsurance intermediaries and positioned the company as a broad-based risk advisor for the insurance industry. Building on the strong foundation, Dan created at Marsh, Peter will draw on his 20 years of experience in the insurance and reinsurance industry to bring the same vision, insight and drive to his new role. Alex Moczarski will now lead Guy Carpenter. Alex had been CEO of the International division of Marsh, and was instrumental in the building its substantial presence in markets throughout the world. Under his leadership, Marsh's International operations have been a strong contributor to Marsh's performance over the past 3 years. Alex has worked tirelessly to build a cohesive international team spanning several continents and he has a passion for the business that always takes into account what is in the best interest of Marsh & McLennan Companies. With more than 30 years in the insurance industry, 18 years at Marsh and before that, with AIG, Alex is an internationalist. He spent time in Latin America and Europe, as well as the United States, gaining invaluable experience and perspective needed to guide to lead Guy Carpenter as it focuses on the enormous potential of international growth. I want to emphasize that our strong management team includes our colleagues within Mercer and Oliver Wyman, led by Michele and John. The entire senior management team will continue working together with a long-term focus driving performance. And before anyone asks, I couldn't be more engaged and energized about the company's prospects than I am today. With that, let me turn it over to Vanessa to review our first quarter results in more detail.
Vanessa Wittman: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to report that the financial performance of Marsh & McLennan Companies in the first quarter was strong. We achieved solid revenue growth and increased operating income in each of our operating companies. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share in the first quarter was $0.58, including $0.56 from continuing operations, discontinued operations of $0.02 related largely to Putnam. And it's important to note that our adjusted EPS equaled GAAP EPS from continuing operations. On an adjusted basis, first quarter EPS increased 10% to $0.56. First, let's go into a little more detail on our consolidated results. Unless specifically indicated, my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses and adjusted operating income. Investment income rose to $19 million from $8 million last year. In the second quarter, we anticipate a slight loss due to a mark-to-market declines in our private equity portfolio, which are recorded on a one quarter lag. In the first quarter, interest income rose to $7 million due to higher cash balances compared with last year and slightly higher interest rates. Interest expense decreased to $51 million in the fourth -- first quarter from $60 million a year ago due to the payment of a $550 million senior note last September. Our next debt maturity is a $250 million note due in March of next year. Let's turn to the results of our operations. In Risk and Insurance Services, both Marsh and Guy Carpenter contributed to strong revenue growth in the first quarter. Operating income increased 7% to $383 million. This growth in profitability was achieved despite higher pension costs and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. The euro and the British pound were weak, relative to the U.S. dollar in January, which is a major renewal period for Guy Carpenter and the largest period of profitability for Marsh's European operations. Had it not been for the effects of foreign exchange, Risk and Insurance Services would have achieved slight margin improvement instead of the slight decline. Even taking this into account, Marsh had another solid quarter. Revenue rose 4% in the first quarter to $1.3 billion, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of growth. Every one of Marsh's major geographic operations experienced revenue growth in the quarter, with particularly strong growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Additionally, U.S./Canada generated revenue growth of 3% for the third consecutive quarter, a real achievement considering the market conditions. Turning to Reinsurance Broking. Guy Carpenter continued to build on its very strong performance in 2010. Revenue was $340 million, reflecting strong growth of 7% led by its International operations and global specialties. This quarter marks Carpenter's ninth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, reflecting continuing strong new business and high client retentions. Our Consulting segment continued to generate strong revenue growth. In the first quarter, revenue rose 6% to $1.3 billion. Growth in operating expenses was 5%, including the impact of higher pension expense. Operating income rose 13%. Mercer's revenue increased 5% in the first quarter to $922 million, continuing its strong performance from the second half of last year. Within Retirement, revenue growth in EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America was offset by declines in North America. Health and Benefits continued its outstanding performance, matching its 8% growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2010. All global regions showed strength, particularly the U.S., Latin America and Asia Pacific.  Rewards, Talent & Communications produced double-digit revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter. This was due to continuing demand for Mercer's compensation surveys, as well as higher demands for consulting services in all major geographies. In the quarter, outsourcing revenue was negatively impacted by the loss of 2 clients due to M&A. The double-digit growth in Investment Consulting & Management continued a trend that has now extended for more than a year. Oliver Wyman's 9% growth rate in this quarter was its highest since 2007. This impressive growth was led by a number of industry sectors that achieved double-digit increases, including healthcare, transportation and retail. Oliver Wyman's close management of operating expenses also contributed to excellent growth and operating income. Debt at the end of the first quarter was $3 billion, unchanged from year end.  Average diluted shares rose due to 3 factors: one, acquisitions; two, an increase in common share equivalents due to a higher share price; and three, the normal vesting of equity awards. The increase was partially offset by share repurchases.  Quarter-end's cash was $1.3 billion compared with $1.1 billion a year ago. Our cash utilization is typically greatest in the first quarter, primarily due to the payment of incentive compensation awards. Other major uses of cash in the first quarter included $120 million for acquisitions and dividend payments of $117 million. We delayed repurchasing shares due to our normal heavy cash uses in the first quarter. But now in the second quarter, with bonus payments behind us and the anticipation of a tax refund in June related to the Kroll disposition, we plan to resume repurchasing our shares.  With that, let me turn it back to Brian.
Brian Duperreault: Thanks, Vanessa, probably, we should begin our Q&A session. Just as a reminder, our operating companies' CEOs are here to answer your questions. And for the first quarter results at Marsh, it's more appropriate, I think, that Dan answers. And the same for Guy Carpenter, I think it's more appropriate Peter answers. And with that, let's take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll first hear from Keith Walsh with Citi.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: First question for Dan and then I've got one for Peter. And Dan, just on -- thinking about enhanced commissions. How should we be thinking about that year-over-year? Do you have more paying customers and more revenues this year than you did last, if you can directionally give us some color there?
Daniel Glaser: Sure. In general, I would look broadly on our strategy of increasing carrier revenue streams. Enhanced commission is part of that strategy but also fee-for-service agreements with carriers is also part of that strategy. If I look at the quarter specifically, I mean, we made progress last year and we are making progress this year. If I look at the quarter on a global basis, about a 0.25 of our growth were related to yield initiative, fee-for-services and enhanced commissions.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: Okay. Great. And then for Peter, 9 consecutive quarters of growth and coincidentally, I guess, Aon, Benfield was done 9 quarter ago. So maybe if you could just give us an idea of what percent of that growth is really coming from fallout from a merger that size? And then if you could have any commentary on our RMS '11?
Peter Zaffino: Yes. Again, our success over many quarters has been focusing on driving value to clients. And this quarter is no exception. We had our strongest quarter of new business ever and it was up 20% year-over-year when you look at the first quarter of '10 to '11. So again, it's very strong and it's coming from everywhere. Our competitors, we've had driven significant value to client that created new reinsurance opportunities. So there is no one specific trend, I think we've been executing very well on new business. In terms of RMS, it's not quite clear and certain how that's going to impact reinsurance purchasing or the industry as of yet. But we have been working very closely with all of our clients running a series of RMS and other vendor models to understand the changes and how they impact our clients and what specific trends there are. And we're starting to see a lot of the inland exposures being driven off in some of the peak zones, 15-plus percent. And so as renewals come up, we will certainly react to that, floor is the big one on June 1, and then we'll have others on 7, 1. So I think that's going to be a gradual impact as we look into the year.
Operator: Next we hear from Brian Meredith of UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: A couple questions here for you. I guess the first one, can you talk a little bit about exposure growth and what are you seeing from just the economy? Are we seeing exposure breakdown? Is that part of the revenue growth we're seeing here?
Brian Duperreault: Dan?
Daniel Glaser: Sure. We're there seeing a very slight improvement in exposure units, both in terms of payrolls, business interruption values and asset values. But very low-single digits, as an example on the United States and in the U.K. So while it's a very slight tailwind, I wouldn't put exposure growth as being the basis for our growth. Our growth is largely driven by high client retention and new business.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: Great. And then, Vanessa, I'm wondering if you got what the FX-adjusted growth in operating expenses was at Risk and Insurance Services?
Vanessa Wittman: So Keith, we don't break it out, but I think the best way to think about it is that over the course of the year it's going to be a -- have a de minimis impact. It was a slight drag on the margins as I pointed out during the quarter.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. So is it, therefore, so margins were up year-over-year, right? Ex Risk and Insurance Services -- I mean, ex FX?
Brian Duperreault: Yes, excluding FX, absolutely.
Vanessa Wittman: Excluding FX, that's right, Peter -- sorry, Brian.
Operator: Cliff Gallant of Keefe, Bruyette and Woods.
Cliff Gallant - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: Can you talk a little bit about just the M&A strategy and the deals you did over the past year, how are they coming along? Are they meeting targets? And then what is the outlook?
Brian Duperreault: I guess I'll take that. Well, I think so far so good with the ones we've done over the last year. We've been concentrating more on the Marsh & McLennan agency and those things are relative, as you know, relatively new. And the strategy itself is a long-term strategy. So it's going to take a while for the total effect of that network to come together. But in terms of hitting our milestones, I think we're on target and we're going to continue to do that. We've been looking across all the operating companies for acquisitions that enhance capability. So we just finished the one at Mercer, Hammond, that does a lot for the investment side. On Guy Carpenter's side, we did a couple over the last year, so -- right, McKensie and Collins, which increased our capabilities in very specific areas. HSBC was done to enhance Marsh's international capabilities. And so, of course, I've left Oliver Wyman out but they continue to look. And as we find opportunities, we will seize upon them. So it's very targeted and specific and, of course, it has to be meeting all of the standards we laid out for you at Investor Day.
Operator: Next we'll hear from Meyer Shields of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Vanessa commented that retirement was weak in North America, I was wondering if we could get a little more detail on that from Michele?
M. Burns: Sure. Yes, as I indicated to you in the last quarterly call, retirement will continue to face some headwinds struggle as the DB [defined benefit] landscape changes. This quarter, the U.S. struggled a bit more than the rest of the theaters. However, I think that is episodic. If anything, there's a good marker and the fact that 1 million did stabilize. And again, it's come back. That said, I think the thing to remember about the business of retirement is that we are working hard to do 2 things to change and realign our operating model to reflect the new realities, as well as building and continuing to expand into capabilities that actually work in consort with that retirement client, to solve the needs that the retirement client has. So the combination of our Retirement business with the strength of its client base, the strength of the loyalties therein combined with our investment capabilities, makes that a winning hand over the long run.
Brian Duperreault: Okay.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, and if I could turn to Dan really quickly. There've been some chatter recently, whether it's the Japanese earthquake or other factors about the rate that we've stabilized there. Does that hinder the opportunities, the new M&A in the short term? Because brokers have again, I think, you're getting better.
Daniel Glaser: No, I don't think so. I mean, I think in general, we all know that we're in a cyclical business. And if you put yourself in the mind of a seller, they wouldn't sell based upon whether rates in the macro P&C environment were going up or down, because it's so temporary in one way or the other. I think there is a lot of other factors that drive -- it usually has to do with how they believe they can grow their businesses on a going forward basis, what global capabilities that many upper middle market accounts now, or have some global exposures. So which company can help them on a global platform basis? Which company can drive product to them, which they could sell on to their customer base? But I think there's a lot of other factors beyond P&C, so we're not seeing any impact on our pipeline based upon an anticipated flattening market.
Operator: Yaron Kinar, of Deutsche Bank.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG: I want to ask a question about the Risk and Insurance Services margins, maybe to follow-up little bit on Brian's question. So even if I kind of adjust for the foreign exchange effects, it would appear that with comp and benefit ratio being down, are there still something else there that's driving margins lower a little bit? Could you maybe expand on that a little bit?
Brian Duperreault: I guess that's Dan. Or you want to do it Vanessa?
Vanessa Wittman: Yes. Let me start because we do have the pension drag, as well. So we were trying to quantify for you that the FX drag would've lifted from a slight decline in the margin you see for this segment to a slight improvement. But also remember, that on top of the FX drag, which was really the anomaly because of the January rate inflection, exchange rate inflections, you also have that pension drag. We gave some guidance in the fourth quarter that, that would be about $45 million over the course of the year or call it, roughly, $12 million a quarter, and that's about $7 million for RIS [Risk and Insurance Services] and $5 million for Consulting. So if you add that to the -- to your pension -- I'm sorry, to your FX drag, you would have seen positive margins.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG: Got it. And then can I, maybe, ask one other question about the Consulting business, where clearly, there have been 2 major acquisitions in that space over the last couple of years. Because have you seen any -- a greater flow of resumes or talents looking for [indiscernible] opportunities after those acquisitions?
M. Burns: Absolutely, the market for talent currently is quite high. There's a lot of movement between firms, a lot of activity in the market. Obviously, we're in a unique position because we have a stable base to take advantage of that as appropriate, and we continue to build our business and our capabilities for this time. We feel very advantaged in the fact that we have not had the requirement or the need to do the large acquisition, instead, we've been able to deploy our capital to do tuck-in acquisitions that actually extend capability and allow us to have freedom of movement across the rest of portfolios to continue to build.
Operator: Matthew Heimermann, JPMorgan.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Question for Dan, just on growth in the Marsh segment. You mentioned about a quarter, that was commission enhancement. Based on your response to Brian's question, it sounds like there were some positive impact from the economy. So I guess, what I'd be curious about is are you still seeing growth because retention is increasing year-on-year? That's something you talked about in the past and I'm just curious if that's continuing.
Daniel Glaser: Yes. Our -- we look at it in 2 ways: account retention and revenue retention. Our account retention levels are stable at a high level and are actually, depending on segment and geography, are between 90% and 94%, and those are levels that Marsh hadn't seen until the period of like 2000 and 2001, so our account retention level is very strong. Our revenue retention level, which really is the revenue we get on accounts on sort of the same-store basis, has been increasing as well. And that is where you could see some mild stabilization of rates, some mild increases in exposure units and expanded new sales to existing customers. So if you look at our growth in the quarter, it was very broadly distributed. We have 32 countries that grew organically 5% or more, and we have very strong new business both internationally and in the U.S./Canada. Our new business for the quarter is about $240 million.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. That's helpful. So if I -- just to summarize, and I realize these are my numbers, but if growth was 4%, you get about a 1% from the commission enhancement, maybe 1% from some of the economic things you talked about and then probably about 2% from the new business growth?
Daniel Glaser: Well, you're far more technical than us. We go out there and we try to find a new customer, so I would just leave it at that.
Brian Duperreault: Matt, let's say, you're [indiscernible].
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: That doesn't count too far off though, does it?
Daniel Glaser: [indiscernible] we'll leave it at that, okay?
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Fair enough.
Daniel Glaser: That's good. That's okay.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: The other question I have for John, and I guess, Michele could opine on this as well, is just -- I think, previously, it's been -- the pipeline for the Specialty Consulting business has been quite full. I guess, I'd just be curious about whether or not the pipeline is starting to clear at kind of a pace consistent with past recoveries or whether or not that pipeline is still, maybe, fuller than it should be because things still aren't moving, even though the growth is picking up, aren't moving as fast as you normally would expect?
Brian Duperreault: Well, I think Matthew, if you look at the last 5 quarters, we've had revenue growth between 6% and 9% in each of the last 5 quarters. And I think that trajectory is broadly reflective of relatively weak recovery, but still growing business confidence over the last 5 quarters relative to say, '08 and '09. Now looking forward, I think, we're seeing a continuation of that same environment broadly. That is, we're still not seeing a spike in recovery, but we would expect the pipeline to clear at a pace similar to what we've seen over the last 5 quarters. So I think our outlook is for more of the same rather than a spike up or down.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. That's helpful.
M. Burns: Now, for Mercer, in our Specialty businesses, we actually lagged on a bit for a couple quarters and we did not see the turn until the third quarter of last year. Since that time, it has been consistent and strong and we have strong pipeline into the immediate and mid-term.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: All right. Thanks for that. And then, can I sneak one numbers question just on depreciation and amortization? I'd just be curious if you could give us a sense of what's happening with intangible amortization relative to just depreciation?
Vanessa Wittman: Intangibles are going to go up because of our acquisitions, so it would be a higher percentage. And you should expect that to stay in line with our M&A activity going forward.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. That's very -- but no other -- I mean, there's no underlying change in the depreciation number?
Vanessa Wittman: No.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. Perfect.
Operator: Larry Greenberg, Langen McAlenney.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: For modeling purposes, when we think about buybacks going forward, should we assume, all other things equal, it will be greater in the latter half of the year when you tend to generate more cash?
Brian Duperreault: Well, I guess certainly, if you take the quarter out, the first quarter out, and then, the next 9 months, I'd say, certainly. Whether it's latter half of the year, I think it at all depends on a lot of market conditions, et cetera. But the first quarter is the anomaly.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Okay, fair enough. And then clearly, the sense from the underwriting community has been that the tone of the marketplace has changed for commercial lines. And I'm wondering if you could just give us your thoughts on that.
Brian Duperreault: Dan?
Daniel Glaser: Sure. Well I just got back from RIMS last night and it was a very active RIMS, lots of clients, lots of underwriter discussions. And I think you're right that the tone in the discussions is a bit different. Underwriters are not quite as aggressively pursuing new business and not quite as malleable with existing clients. That's not to say that they are walking away from clients based upon prices. And so I think, we're in a sort of shoulder season. We're not quite soft but we're certainly not hard, so it feels like it's stabilizing. I know from talking to our marketing pubs, placements are still getting done. Oftentimes, with reductions still, but the marketing of those placements is more difficult than it had been at this time last year. Okay?
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: And could Peter maybe comment on reinsurance?
Peter Zaffino: Sure. The reinsurance, remember, for our portfolio, over 50% of our business incepts on January 1, so as all these different catastrophes happen in the first quarter we're really looking forward as some of the major quarters that come up. The true story won't be told until next year. But similar to what Dan is saying, there are signs that rate reductions are starting to slow down, we still saw that in the first quarter on property cap and there will be a confluence of events. We've seen what happened in Japan. But as we see the earnings calls for reinsurers, many of them have increased their own estimates on what Japan means and what the expected loss is. So we have that coupled with RMS, coupled with the largest quarter catastrophes outside of the U.S. in the history of reinsurance. So, now all those confluence of events are going to have companies taking a hard look at how they're going to deploy their capital and how they are going to price the business going forward, so it's a very similar theme.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Adam Klauber, William Blair.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: A couple questions on Mercer. Obviously, growth was pretty strong at Health and Benefits and Rewards, Talent. Is that a function of pent-up demand from the recession or is that a function of new clients or a combination?
M. Burns: That is, I would say, a combination of the two. Let's start with Health and Benefits. We're still not seeing growth in employment in the U.S. at such rates as to impact that, so you would have to attribute the growth in H and B, Health and Benefits to the new business, new clients, expanded business or existing clients. Some of that would have to do with healthcare reform and we expect that trend to continue. We see that growth across the entire marketplace, whether it's in the top end of the market all the way to the small employer, where our D&A, the top of it have approach to providing, broking and consulting services, and Health and Benefits is winning in marketplace. With regard to Specialty Consulting, clearly, there is a pent-up demand where people have taken an opportunity to step back in to their talent management space, especially, both in the United States and around the world. I just recently completed a trip that covered Mexico to Argentina and met with a number of CEOs and CFOs and CHR. Those Chief Human Resource Officers seek consistent demand from them, bar none, was Talent Management, talent advice around their workforce strategies, and so yes, they have taken their eye off of that for a while, as we will all weather in the great recession, but have moved back into that space.
Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Okay. And one more follow-up on Mercer. The expense line effectively moved up with the revenue line. I think expense growth was roughly 8%, 9% for the quarter. Should we expect that trend going forward? That expense should track revenue or should we get some margin expansion with -- if revenue remains at high level?
M. Burns: This segment expects margin expansion over the mid- and longer-term. I think that we focus on profitability and with revenue growth you do, in fact, need some degree of expense growth to fuel the people and the talent and the pipeline to do the work. But that said, there were some couple of anomalies I won't even bother to call out in the first quarter. As we move forward, you should expect margin expansion across the segment fairly consistently.
Operator: Thomas Mitchell of Miller Tabak.
Thomas Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC: Just in a broad sense, looking back and not making adjustments for what you did own and don't own, of course, the level of overall Consulting side earnings was considerably higher, let's say, if we go back to the first quarter of 2007, 2008. As we sort of model looking forward through the next couple of years, do you see the possibility that we could get back to similar levels of profitability or have we sort of adjusted to a lower level to start from and it'll be a more modest growth?
Brian Duperreault: How about if I answer that one? Because I would say that when we look at the potential for Consulting, those '07 levels, certainly, they reflect an economy that was robust, no question about it. But, I'd say that we have every belief that we can get back to those levels, over time.
Thomas Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC: Okay. Good.
Operator: Our final question for today will be a follow-up from Meyer Shields of Stifel Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Is the first quarter corporate expense a good run rate for the year?
Brian Duperreault: Vanessa?
Vanessa Wittman: We will have some movement as we figure out our new management structure. So I think you can use it, but we may revise that guidance for you in the next quarter call.
Brian Duperreault: Okay? All right, well, let me just close and thank, first of all, thank you for attending the call and thank my associates all around the world for getting us off for a good start and wish all these guys with new jobs luck in their new endeavors. So good luck to you all. Thanks, again. We'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: That does concludes today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to Marsh & McLennan Companies Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Fourth quarter and full year 2010 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the Marsh & McLennan Companies' website at www.mmc.com.  Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the remarks made may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements as the term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. In particular, references during this conference call to anticipated or expected results of operations for 2011 or subsequent periods are forward-looking statements, and Marsh & McLennan Companies' actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. Please refer to Marsh & McLennan Companies' most recent SEC filings, as well as the company's earnings release, which are available on the Marsh & McLennan Companies website, for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
Brian Duperreault: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results as reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me in presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. I'd also like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs to today's call, Dan Glaser of Marsh, Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter, Michelle Burns of Mercer and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations.  So let's get right to it. I'm very pleased with our performance, not only in the fourth quarter, but for the full year as well. When we reported our results a year ago, we indicated that our primary goal for the year ahead was to drive top and bottom line growth across the enterprise. Our plan was to grow revenue organically and through strategic acquisitions. A year later, I'm delighted to be able to say we've met both our objectives.  Let's start with the fourth quarter. We produced very strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter with reported growth of 9%. On an underlying basis, the overall increase for the company was 6%, including 6% growth at Marsh, 3% at Guy Carpenter, 5% at Mercer and 8% at Oliver Wyman. We're also very pleased with our level of revenue growth for the full year, which was 7% as reported and 3% on an underlying basis. Additionally, we're encouraged that revenue performance got stronger as the year progressed. In both the third and fourth quarters, all our operating companies produced revenue growth on both a reported and an underlying basis. And importantly, we achieved this solid revenue growth while effectively managing expenses. Overall, adjusted underlying expenses grew only 2% last year despite having to absorb a significant increase in pension costs.  While we continue to manage our business efficiently, we have also been actively reinvesting in our future. Major investments, not only in 2010, but over the last three years, include key strategic hires, value-added technology for clients, product development and expanded analytical capabilities within each of our operating companies. By combining revenue growth with expense management, we produced excellent earnings growth in 2010. For example, adjusted operating income increased from $1.3 billion in 2009 to $1.5 billion in 2010, an increase of 14%.  As you are aware, we decided, after a thorough, strategic review, to divest Kroll, a transaction we completed last August at a very satisfactory price. Aggregate cash proceeds, including the prior divestment of selected Kroll business units and related tax benefits, will be $1.6 billion. So overall, Marsh & McLennan Companies delivered a very impressive performance last year both from a financial and a strategic perspective.  Now let's turn to our operating segments. Both Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting produced good underlying revenue growth in 2010. Adjusted operating income increased 10% at Risk and Insurance Services and 16% at Consulting. Both segments also increased adjusted operating margins for the year.  We were pleased that Marsh's underlying revenue growth rate increased each quarter during the year. This growth was fueled by new business development. Guy Carpenter also had an excellent year with good underlying revenue growth, a continued focus on expense control and strong growth in adjusted operating income. We are especially pleased with the expansion of its international operations, reflecting one of Guy Carpenter's strategic initiatives.  Our Consulting operations also performed well in 2010. Mercer reported underlying revenue growth of mid-single digits in both the third and fourth quarters, and Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth of 8% in the fourth quarter capped a very good year. Importantly, both companies grew adjusted operating income in 2010, and the segment margin rose 110 basis points.  Prudent and effective capital management, including disciplined redeployment of excess cash into accretive acquisitions and share repurchase will also contribute to long-term earnings growth and increasing shareholder value.  On the acquisition front, we continued the development of the Marsh & McLennan Agency with nine acquisitions over the past 15 months. These acquisitions are expected to add annualized revenue approaching $300 million.  Additionally, in 2010, Mercer completed several acquisitions to broaden its client capabilities. The most recent acquisition of Hammond Associates, which established Mercer as a leader in investment consulting for endowments and foundations. It's also worth noting that we initiated our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter.  As we indicated at Investor Day, our goal is to re-establish Marsh & McLennan Companies as an elite, global growth company, not just in relation to our direct competitors, but with respect to other leading global companies. Our strategy focuses on the characteristics that create exceptional value and superior return for investors, long-term growth, low capital requirements, high cash generation with disciplined capital management and a low risk profile. Emphasizing these four pillars should produce 10% organic growth in operating income over the long term.  We view 2010 as a very successful year for the company, and we are confident about our prospects for the coming year. Now let me turn it over to Vanessa to review our fourth quarter and full year results in more detail.
Vanessa Wittman: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of Marsh & McLennan's results for the quarter, then I'll discuss the results of each operating company. I'll close with some observations regarding our financial position, including pensions. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $0.37, which included $0.34 from continuing operations. The $0.03 from discontinued operations was primarily insurance recoveries related to Putnam.  On an adjusted basis, EPS in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 8% to $0.41 from $0.38 in the fourth quarter of 2009. In September, we funded a $550 million debt maturity. This reduced our interest expense in the fourth quarter to $53 million from the prior run rate of $60 million per quarter. We have no debt maturing in 2011.  Investment income was $19 million in the fourth quarter, largely due to gains in our private equity portfolio, which are recorded on a one quarter lag. In the fourth quarter of 2009, investment income was $23 million. Looking ahead to this year's first quarter, we anticipate investment income of approximately $15 million.  Let's turn to the results of our operations. Unless specifically indicated, my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses and adjusted operating income. As Brian discussed, the financial performance of Marsh & McLennan was impressive in 2010. We achieved growth in both revenue and operating income in every one of our operating companies, not only in the quarter, but for the full year. On a consolidated basis, operating income in the fourth quarter rose 22% to $379 million compared with the prior year. For the full year, operating income increased 14% from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.  In Risk and Insurance Services, revenue in the fourth quarter rose 5% to $1.5 billion. Operating income increased 22% to $259 million from $213 million in the prior year, reflecting higher margins at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. For the year, Risk and Insurance Services' growth and operating income was 10%, increasing from $985 million to $1.1 billion.  Despite continuing soft market conditions, Marsh had another great quarter. Reflecting sequential improvement throughout the year, revenue rose a strong 6% in the fourth quarter to $1.3 billion. All geographic operations experienced revenue growth in the quarter, with particularly strong growth in EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. The positive momentum in Marsh's new business generation through the first nine months continued in the fourth quarter. This resulted in global new business growth of 8% for the year.  Despite a significant increase in pension expense, Marsh increased its profitability as well as its margin in the fourth quarter.  Turning to reinsurance broking. Guy Carpenter continued its excellent performance, led by its international operations. Revenue was $184 million, growing 3% over last year's fourth quarter. This is especially notable considering current market conditions. In fact, this quarter marks Carpenter's eighth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, reflecting continuing strong new business and high client retention over the past two years. Ongoing expense discipline produced improved operating income for both the fourth quarter and the year.  In our Consulting segment, revenue in the fourth quarter rose 6% to $1.3 billion. Growth in operating expenses, including higher pension expense, was held to 4% for the quarter and was only 2% for the entire year. In the fourth quarter, operating income rose 17% from $142 million to $166 million. For the year, operating income increased 16% from $477 million to $553 million with margin improvement of 110 basis points. Mercer's revenue increased 5% in the fourth quarter to $910 million, similar to the growth in the third quarter, highlighting the balanced portfolio Mercer has built over the past several years.  Within Retirement Consulting, revenue growth in Canada and Latin America was more than offset by declines in the U.S. and EMEA. Health and Benefits Consulting continued its strong performance, matching its 8% growth in the third quarter. All regions around the world showed strength, with the U.S. and Europe's growth improving and impressive growth in Canada, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. This performance reflects the recent investments made by Mercer, as well as a stabilizing global economy and employment market.  Rewards, Talent and Communications produced double-digit revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, partly due to a resurgence in demand for Mercer's compensation surveys across all major geographic regions.  Outsourcing revenue was up 5% in the quarter. Investment Consulting and Management increased 14%, affirming Mercer's strategy to provide enhanced investment solutions for their clients' retirement plans. Even with higher pension expense, Mercer's operating income increased in both the fourth quarter and for the year.  Oliver Wyman also generated strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter, which continues the positive performance that we saw throughout the year. Revenue increased 8% to $399 million, reflecting a broad-based growth in the business. Oliver Wyman's practices in the healthcare, transportation, consumer and communication sectors all generated double-digit increases. For the year, revenue increased 7%, including double-digit growth in the financial services sector, Oliver Wyman's largest industry specialty. Oliver Wyman also produced excellent growth in operating income for the fourth quarter and full year.  Turning to the cost of our defined benefit plans. As you know, higher pension expense impacted earnings per share in 2010 by slightly more than $0.10. We are projecting that pension expense will increase modestly in 2011, impacting earnings per share by $0.05. This increase reflects lower discount rates at December 31, 2010, compared with the end of 2009. Despite this increase, we expect to generate double-digit growth in earnings. From a funding perspective, we made a tax-efficient $200 million discretionary contribution to our U.S. retirement plan last September.  Combined with ongoing contributions to our worldwide plans, total cash contributions to our pension plans in 2010 was approximately $450 million. For 2011, we expect contributions to our global pension plans to be approximately $300 million. And looking at our balance sheet, cash at the end of the year was $1.9 billion compared with $1.7 billion at the end of the third quarter. The major uses of our cash in the fourth quarter included approximately $245 million for acquisitions; $119 million for our fourth quarter dividend payment to shareholders, which reflects a 5% increase on a per share basis; and $86 million for the start of our $500 million share repurchase program. By year-end, we purchased 3.4 million shares.  In addition to our year-end's cash position of $1.9 billion, we expect to receive $230 million in the first half of this year from tax credits related to the Kroll disposition. For modeling purposes, you should continue to use a 31% adjusted tax rate for the year.  With that, let me turn it back to Brian.
Brian Duperreault: Thanks, Vanessa. Candace, I think we -- operator, we can go to questions now.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Keith Walsh with Citi.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: First, for Dan. Just thinking about you guys are more of primarily a fee business, Marsh, in the U.S. Can you talk a little bit about the leverage to improving exposures in a fee business versus maybe your competitors a little more commission-based? And then the second piece of that, it seems every broker is facing expense inflation. How do you think about that to make sure shareholders are getting the leverage of a better top line?
Daniel Glaser: So let me take your first question. One, our overall business, as you know, is now majority outside of the United States. And so when I look at my global business, I'm about 50-50 between fee and commission, and it's more like 60-40 in the U.S. and 40-60 in the rest of the world. And so I feel very well-balanced. In terms of your question on leverage, I think that the commission business is slightly more leveraged to a hard market than the fee business. But having said that, fees are based upon value. And I think we demonstrate increased value in a hard market, and I feel that there would be upward momentum on the fee side as well as the market tightens and as our jobs, serving clients, become more complicated. You saw the reverse of that in the soft market. There was some downward pressure on fees through the soft market, and so it gives you some insulation. But I really like the way that we're positioned 50-50, and I feel levered enough to the market. In terms of expansion possibilities and leverage as we grow, we manage our expenses very carefully. I think some of our expansion is being masked right now. If I just look at the fourth quarter, our expense base, half of our expense growth in the fourth quarter within Marsh was based on pension increase and some severance expenses that did not run through the restructuring line that ran through our operating line. So the other thing I would say is all throughout the downturn and over the last couple of years, we've continued to invest in the business. So I don't feel any pent-up requirement to have some sort of rebound in expense to get us back to some sort of a trajectory in investing in the business. We've been steady throughout, so I feel quite good about that.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: And then just for Vanessa, you mentioned the pension expense. I think you guys are the only ones out there that still have an active pension plan, if I'm correct. Why not freeze the plan at this point? If you could just talk to that.
Brian Duperreault: Keith, let me do this one. Let me do this one. This is Brian. We do constantly look at all our benefit plans, pension in particular. What pension does for us is add a bit of volatility to our income, bottom line. The expense movements, positive and negative, there's a bit of volatility to it. Overall, so far from what I can see, it is a reasonable approach for our employees and for our shareholders, but it does have this volatility to it. And what we did in the last year, and it was considerably volatile last year, the swing was considerable, was that we were able to manage that and still produce excellent growth and control of our expenses. And as we pointed out, it's going to be a bit of a drag this year coming. We gave you the number. But I think still, long term, it is reasonable for us to maintain. Now we'll constantly look at that. You never say never. But I think the volatility question is something we have been able to address, and I expect that we will continue to address it. And therefore, long term, I like the position we're in.
Operator: We'll go now to Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: The first one on the Consulting side. Can you dig in a little bit on the outsourcing revenue growth in the quarter? Was it new business, or was it growth from this exposures, payrolls? Can you give a little more detail on that?
Brian Duperreault: Michelle will do that.
M. Burns: Certainly. This is Michelle. The outsourcing growth was sales of new business that had occurred both in 2009 and into 2010. As a matter of fact, in the outsourcing business, we have about $50 million of added wins during 2010 that will also affect our results in the future. So as we said and promised, that business was built and is built to be a scale business. What you're seeing is the impact of that scale as we sell the service across all our product lines and bundled with other pieces of Mercer's offering.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: Are you seeing any benefit from the other large merger in the industry?
M. Burns: There's a lot of activity in the industry. The large merger in the industry is a little bit still recent, but there are certainly transfers of talent moving around and lots of activity in the marketplace with regard to our clients as they take a look at how services will be provided. So we feel well-positioned with regard to that combination.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: And then for Dan, we know what the organic revenue growth and obviously know what the revenues look like from the recent acquisitions. What was the earnings contribution like from some of the recent acquisitions? Are they still a pretty big drag on margins?
Daniel Glaser: A couple of things. One, when I look overall at the acquisitions within Marsh over the last couple of years, it adds about $475 million of revenue. In terms of contribution on an earnings basis, it was very negligible in 2010 and will be a more meaningful contributor in 2011. In terms of margin, it was a bit of a drag in 2010. But in 2011, as our agency gets broader, it should perform very similarly to the overall U.S. business. Over time, it will perform with a better margin than the core U.S. business. But for 2011, it will be very similar.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: And I was thinking specifically also on the HSBC acquisition, because I know there were several -- some of the restructuring charges coming through around that one. Is that positive from an earnings perspective yet?
Daniel Glaser: It was not positive in 2010. It will certainly be positive in 2011.
Operator: We'll go now to Matthew Heimermann with JP Morgan.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: First, for Dan. Just on the agency acquisitions, can you give us a sense of what inning we are in, in terms of building a platform? And then also, I guess for John, can you just give us a sense of where the pipeline is in Oliver Wyman today? And how that maybe compares to 12 months ago?
Daniel Glaser: Okay, so I'll take the agency question first. We're still in the early stages in my mind. I mean, right now, the agency is nearing $300 million of revenue. I've said before, I think that this business could be a $750 million to a $1 billion business. I'm very satisfied with where we are. I'm very satisfied with the pipeline that we have and the type of agencies that we're having conversations with. We are building out the capability and had several acquisitions right around year-end and in the early part of 2011. So I would characterize this as still the early stages.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: So is the delta between the $750 million to $1 billion and the $300 million today all going to be acquisitions? Or what role will organic growth play in getting you there?
Daniel Glaser: Well, certainly, organic growth within the agencies will occur. And as you've seen, you can look through the CIAB [Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers] type of information and look at what growth rates have been occurring in those kind of businesses. I mean, certainly, some of the those businesses, and to Keith's question earlier, are more highly levered because they're commission-based businesses and they're in the small commercial and middle market. I would see there'd be a combination of organic growth, in certain Marsh offices, we're handling some small business not as efficiently as the agency is. So over time, we would probably move some of the business around as we build out our platform and acquisitions. But acquisitions would be the principal source.
Brian Duperreault: So we get John to answer the pipeline question. John?
John Drzik: So the Oliver Wyman pipeline's very healthy today, consistent with us staying on the rough top line trajectory we established in 2010. A year ago, we looked at 2010 and expected to see relatively weak recovery in economic conditions in the U.S. and Europe. A little better than that, obviously, in emerging markets, and that was consistent with the revenue growth that we established in 2010. I think as we entered 2011, our broad sense of the macro environment is similar, continuation of the weak recovery in the developed markets, better than that in terms of emerging markets, and that's what our pipeline’s showing today. And so I think pretty consistent with where we were a year ago.
Operator: We'll go to Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: I might have misheard this, but it almost sounded as if in your opening comments and Vanessa's comments that you were kind of emphasizing the competitive conditions in the reinsurance business. And I'm just wondering if you are all sensing that, perhaps, reinsurance competition is taking a ratchet up a little bit. And maybe you could just -- maybe Dan and Peter and Brian, certainly, if you want to chime in, just on what pricing looks like out there on the underwriting side?
Brian Duperreault: Let me start. I'm not sure we emphasized there's some kind of ratcheting up of competition in reinsurance. Reinsurance remains competitive. And Peter can give you the numbers. But it's an area that continues to show rate declines, and yet we had good organic growth. And I think particularly compared to others, and I think that was what we're trying to emphasize, but-- Peter, do you want to say something?
Peter Zaffino: Yes. The market has remained pretty stable. We've seen rate decreases on average of 5% to 10% for property tax. Some of the areas that are more localized actually saw some stabilization of rates. Chile, I think we'll anticipate that, and Australia. And casualty pricing has remained modest to slightly down. So we really haven't seen any different trends. And when you look at reinsurance brokers, well, that's really driven by the first quarter because more than 50% of the portfolio is renewed in the first quarter. So even when you see rate deterioration in a fourth quarter, it doesn't really impact the quarter that much. So you're really looking at a very stable, modest decrease, and as we look into 2011, believe it will be the same.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: We could play around with the numbers, but do you have what the underlying growth in the business units would've been excluding pension in 2010?
Vanessa Wittman: Larry, I think the easiest way to look at it is to say that the margin expansion would have been -- for RIS, it would have been about 120 basis points, and for Consulting, it would have moved from 110 to 160 basis points. That's probably the easiest way to get at it.
Operator: We'll go next to Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Brian, I heard you quoted in a conference saying that you don't get necessarily need a macro event to change pricing. Sometimes, carriers just get exhausted by the fact that their business is unprofitable. Is there any actual sign of that yet?
Brian Duperreault: Any sign of that. Yes. I'm glad you're ready. Well, what I was trying to emphasize is that personal experience here, it's more of the psyche of the market that drives hard and soft markets. And we always keep talking about it, we have this catastrophe, things will change. And I try to point out that in 2001, before 9/11, the rates just started going up. There was no catastrophe, it was just exhaustion. And in 2008, we had a cataclysm, with $100 billion of capital disappeared overnights almost, and the rates didn't change. So there's a couple of cases in point where it wasn't a catastrophe one way or the other. And so what I was trying to emphasize is that one needs to see or understand what the psyche of the market is and how people are feeling and is there exhaustion in the market. And I said, we didn't see that in '09. We didn't see it in '10. We don't see it so far in '11. So I'm not sure that the catastrophe itself would do something. Of course, I was bold enough to say it's probably sooner than later, but remember, we have very long cycles. Anyway, but that's what I was trying to point out. So no, I think at this point, I haven't seen exhaustion hit the market yet. We're supposed to be able to perform in all weathers. And what I try to explain to the underwriting community, about what we think of ourselves here is, most trading conditions are soft. And so if you can't perform in soft markets, you can't perform. And for us, this is the time to put the company right, get the place in the best shape possible so that when the hard market occurs, you maximize. And that's what we're doing. With what Dan and Peter have done in their respective companies, with the acquisitions we've done, particularly in agency, that's our plan. Okay, Meyer?
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: One quick question for Vanessa. I might have missed this, but the tax rate was higher than we anticipated in the quarter, and I was hoping you can explain that.
Vanessa Wittman: Sure. If you look at the adjusted tax rate for the full year, Meyer, it was at 31%, which is similar to the guidance I gave last year for the full year and also similar to what we're seeing for 2011. In the fourth quarter, we go through a reconciliation of the estimates for the first three quarters to make final end-of-year adjustments to take into account the geographic mix of our profitability, as well as any impact of state and local taxes. And that's what you're seeing in that higher rate for the fourth quarter.
Operator: We'll go now to Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.
Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG: I was wondering if you could maybe give a little more color on what I would say is robust underlying revenue growth in both RIS and Consulting. I mean, are you achieving that through pricing, more discretionary spending, exposure growth, taking market share?
Brian Duperreault: I guess the answer is yes. Do you want to -- maybe Dan and Michelle in particular could answer.
Daniel Glaser: Sure. So several factors contributed to our growth in the quarter. I would say our new business generation would be first and foremost. We had $276 million of new business in the quarter, which is the highest quarter of new business since all the way back in 2007. Our past and present hiring of top-tier talent, our success in generating enhanced commission and fee-for-services agreements with carriers, all of those contributed to our overall performance. I've been in the business a long time, so I don't get overly excited about growth in any one quarter. I look at it for the year. In 2009, we were minus one, so our real focus in 2010 was to get growth going again. And for the year, we were at plus two on an underlying basis. Looking forward, I would think we will do better than that, but I wouldn't necessarily extrapolate the fourth quarter and say that, that would be continuing. I mean, hope so, and we're out there plugging away, but it was a terrific quarter, and a lot of things broke our way.
Brian Duperreault: Michelle?
M. Burns: From Mercer's perspective, I think it's a direct reflection of our strategy and the strategy that we've been executing on for, frankly, the past several years. We've made decisions to expand our core Consulting units, and continued to invest in it, and several of the organic and inorganic investments that we've made at Mercer were inter-core Consulting. But in addition, we made a decision to expand in our next-generation businesses, and those businesses are outsourcing, the outsourcing pillar and the investment pillar, and we've consistently done that. This quarter and last quarter, as matter of fact, as Dan said, the full year reflects that strategy. You see growth in Consulting pillar which was hardest hit by the recessionary period, but with good growth in outsourcing and outstanding growth in investments. And so the blend is really giving our clients two things: giving our clients a lot of stability with regard to how we service them, new product offerings that they are finding to be innovative, especially in the DB space, and then for the investor, you get that same sense of stability to perform in different areas at different times and bundle products to produce this kind of revenue growth. So from our perspective, we believe that the strategy has been confirmed, and we expect that this will continue into the future as a good, balanced portfolio with which to serve our human resource client.
Brian Duperreault: Our operating companies are all a little different. Maybe I should have John and Peter talk about it. John?
John Drzik: I think in Oliver Wyman, the growth reflects a couple different things. One is the general strengthening of the economy, so Consulting demand tends to follow economic conditions. So obviously, 2010 was a stronger year than '09, and that's part of it. I think also, Oliver Wyman has a particular strength in the Financial Services segment, and our fastest-growing segment is in healthcare, and each of those are industries that are undergoing significant restructuring and where there's greater demand for advice in that type of segment. And so we experienced particularly strong growth in those segments in 2010.
Brian Duperreault: Peter?
Peter Zaffino: Our growth has really been driven by increased new business. Our new business year-over-year in the fourth quarter is up over 25%. We've had very strong client retention, well over 90%, and our expansion within new business has been driving new clients. Roughly 20% of the new business that we've generated is from new clients. And as Vanessa said in her opening, a real significant top line performance from our international operations, specifically in Asia-Pacific. So where we've been making investments and focusing on top line growth, we've been able to execute.
Operator: We'll go to Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: The double-digit earnings growth outlook for 2011, is the baseline for 2010 the $1.64 of adjusted earnings?
Vanessa Wittman: Yes.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: And then, Brian, maybe you can give some insight in terms of where you expect the majority of the growth to come from? Is it both Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting, or should one grow faster than the other, earnings-wise?
Brian Duperreault: Yes. That's great. We're blessed to having a nice balanced portfolio between Consulting and Insurance. Consulting was growing faster this year than Insurance, although the Risk and Insurance, I think, showed great performance, particularly relative to peers. So what would you expect next year? I think the same. I mean, we're still in a soft market, and so that limits, to some degree, what we can do on the Insurance side. Consulting, will, I think, continue to take advantage of the things we pointed out, that Michelle and John pointed out. And the economy is improving, so that should benefit us. And Consulting is more of a late-stage buy in emerging markets. And so our international footprint will help in that regard. So I would say if it's a horse race, maybe Consulting wins by a nose.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: And then on a separate issue, we've been hearing more from our conversations with risk managers that there is increased interest in multiyear deals in terms of fee arrangements with major brokers. Can you comment on that? And also, if there are multiyear deals written, is all that revenue recognized in the initial year?
Brian Duperreault: I think Dan will answer.
Daniel Glaser: A couple things. One, if there's a multiyear deal done, the income is not all recognized in the first year. So that's point number one. There is not any kind of structural change amongst risk managers to multiyear deals. The reality is most multiyear deals have cancellation provisions. And so if you look in the large accounts space, I think the movement is more toward risk managers identifying two or three insurance companies who they want a broader, more strategic global relationship, and they're building those relationships and they recognize that those relationships, contractual or not, will tend to go across many, many years. And we help them with those choices. In the tail-end of every soft market, you tend to get some additional multiyear deals, and then there's a little bit of that out there, but I wouldn't say it's a rush to that level. And frankly, many multiyear deals have certain levels of cancellation provisions within them, either based upon loss ratios or market factors.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Dan, I should have clarified. I meant multiyear fee arrangements with the brokers.
Daniel Glaser: When we do a multiyear fee arrangement -- first of all, we have very few clients that are pure fee. Most of our clients are a combination of fee and commissions. So we get a fee for certain services, but we may get brokerage on some of the transactions that take place in London and Bermuda, as an example. And so there's very few where it's a global fee without any brokerage element on the transactional site. And in terms of multiyear agreements on fees, we actually encourage that because it enables us to plan better. But we also negotiate with risk managers, and we tend not to keep a flat line over multiple years, right, because our expense base grows. Our fee income needs to grow with the expense base, and our clients recognize that.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: And are those fees earned over the course of the arrangement?
Daniel Glaser: Correct, correct.
Operator: We'll go now to Thomas Mitchell with Miller Tabak.
Thomas Mitchell - Miller Tabak & Co., LLC: Looking at your prospects, you certainly have a lot of cash. How do you view today, as compared to three months ago or six months ago, the opportunities to go through acquisition, either on the Consulting side or through organic growth that might take some additional investment? What are the best kinds of opportunities out there today?
Brian Duperreault: Tom, I'll see if I can summarize that. Relative to three months ago, probably not much, not a huge difference in that time frame, a year ago or more might be different. I think you could -- certainly, as things improve economically, the value start to change. And so one would expect that the valuations would be slightly higher going forward than they have been certainly on the Consulting side. I think to me, it's more important what we're buying and does it fit in our strategic positioning. And in that regard, I think we've done quite well so far and certainly, in Consulting, some very interesting acquisitions. I think the company is recognized as one to join again. And so we have that extra added benefit of being a place that would be a good home for a company that has limitations as to where they go. But they're great people, and they've got a great capability, and they look around for what's the next step in their evolution, we're a good home for it. So our prospects actually are improving, not going the other way even with, say, the economy changing. In Insurance, we've committed to the agency development as our primary place for acquisitions. It's not exclusive. We're certainly looking internationally all the time as well. The HSBC is a good example of that. In that regard, I think, again, it's kind of an interesting issue. This is the seller -- do they expect that the economy is going to improve or the market's going to improve? And in that case, maybe they'd be less interested. But again, what I said about Consulting is probably true in spades with respect to the agency because we have now, I think, established a structure, a position in the marketplace that is attractive to those independent agency companies who were, again, looking for some next move, a way to grow. And what they're seeing is an organization that has the kind of qualities they're looking for. And so that's why Dan pointed out the pipeline is very good. And that's a long-winded way of saying I feel -- I certainly feel better this year than I did last year with our prospects, and I think we're going to continue to find good acquisitions. Organic growth acquisitions internally, they're always a little bit more difficult. We can do it through teams, and we can do it through products and everything. And so it doesn't get the same kind of big bang press that another acquisition does. But we try to point that out in the earlier remarks that when we look at -- we’re in this for the long haul, and expense reduction alone doesn't get you anywhere. And so you've got to invest, and we've been investing: Investing in technology and investing in product, investing in people. So that's going to continue. And then my conversion to share buyback will also play a role.
Operator: We'll go next to Scott Heleniak with RBC Capital Markets.
Scott Heleniak - Ferris, Baker Watts: In Mercer, if you saw any improvement in organic growth trends in Retirement over the past few months. I know it's down 6% for the fourth quarter. I'm just wondering if you saw any improvement toward the end of the year and the beginning into 2011 at all? Because obviously, there's a pretty big upside if that gets turned around relative to Consulting.
M. Burns: Absolutely. I think we will continue, frankly, to see retirement struggle, if you will, through this environment as people re-adjust their pension plans. But I think the focal point for Mercer is slightly different, which is we have taken intentionally, and with great intention, the portfolio of services we have and aligned them to this DB market, this defined-benefit market. So you may see that there, there are other places where we're seeing significant growth where we bundle these retirement services along with our investment services and our outsourcing services. And so I don't expect that you will see the raw demand change dramatically in the Retirement business per se, in other words, the traditional business. But the segments that we are pursuing dropped quite heavily, and the changes that we're making in our Retirement business allow us to capture business across the demands that the clients have currently in the same space, but for different kinds of services.
Scott Heleniak - Ferris, Baker Watts: I know you haven't talked about it specifically, but the hub strategy you talked about a couple years ago, have you filled all the hubs? Are you at a point where you have all those completed and you're sort of going to -- I think you termed it as spoke acquisitions. Are you to the point where most of those are going to be those type of acquisitions? Or is there still more left for the kind of big focal point hubs?
Daniel Glaser: There's certainly more hubs that will be required as we fill out the geographic footprint of the agency. The hubs that have been acquired are seeking spoke and fold-in acquisitions. And so you'll see that two of the acquisitions that we've made recently are actually spoke and fold-in operations for Rutherford, as an example. So you'll see us doing spoke and fold-ins for existing hubs, but we are still seeking additional hubs as we fill out our geographic footprint.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
Brian Duperreault: All right, very good. Well, let me end by thanking everyone on the phone for their attention and interest in the stock, and more importantly, sorry to you guys. But more importantly, to all the employees who are listening out there, thanks for a great year. Thanks for a great year. Bye, everybody.
Operator: That concludes our conference for today. Thank you, all, for your participation.

Operator:  Welcome to MMC’s conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. Third quarter 2010 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on MMC’s webcast at www.mmc.com.  Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements related to future events or results which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. In particular, references during this conference call to anticipated or expected results of operations for 2010 or subsequent periods are forward-looking statements, and MMC’s actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. Please refer to MMC’s most recent SEC filings as well as the Company’s earnings release which are available on the MMC website for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I’ll now turn this call over to Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC. 
Brian Duperreault: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I’m Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me and presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. I’d also like to welcome our operating company CEOs to today’s call – Dan Glaser of Marsh, Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter, Michele Burns of Mercer, and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations. I am pleased to report that in the third quarter, MMC produced strong revenue growth of 7%, or 4% on an underlying basis. We are seeing some signs that the effects of the Great Recession are diminishing; however, overall economic conditions remain weak. Also, the insurance services segment continues to face the challenges presented by soft market conditions in the global property casualty marketplace. Even in this difficult operating environment, however, each of our four operating companies produced revenue growth on both a reported and an underlying basis. This is the first quarter this has occurred since 2007. About six weeks ago, MMC held its first investor day under this management team. I was very pleased so many members of the investment community were able to attend, and many others took advantage of the opportunity to watch our live video webcast. The entire program, which included presentations by each of the heads of our operating companies as well as Vanessa’s financial overview, remains available for viewing on our website, mmc.com. I would like to spend a few minute reinforcing some of the major themes I talked about at investor day in making the investment case for MMC. IN the 40 years after Marshall McLennan Companies became a public company in 1962, two of our most notable hallmarks were sustained growth in adjusted earnings per share and total return to shareholders. However, MMC operated in a crisis mode from late 2004 through the end of 2007. As a result, new management was installed nearly three years ago.  Since then, we have successfully resolved legacy issues that prevented the Company from operating at its fullest potential. Today MMC is comprised of four great companies – Marsh, Guy Carpenter, Mercer, and Oliver Wyman. Each is a leader in its field and is led by a strong management team focused on enhancing growth and revenue, and more importantly, earnings. Our goal is to establish MMC as an elite global growth company, not just in relation to our direct competitors but with respect to other leading global companies. To return to a record of superior long-term performance, we will focus on four major pillars in the coming years. First, growth. We are committed to generating long-term revenue and earnings growth. MMC should produce long-term organic revenue growth at least equal to global GDP growth augmented by acquisitions; and a continuing focus on expense discipline should expand margins and lead to 10% growth in operating income in a multitude of operating environments.  We are beginning to see the results of this strategy in MMC’s financial performance for the first nine months of 2010 which is more indicative of our performance than any one particular quarter. Through the third quarter, MMC produced 11% growth in adjusted operating income. This was in an operating environment in which MMC’s underlying revenue rose 2% but adjusted underlying expenses were held to only 1%.  Also contributing to long-term earnings growth is prudent and effective capital management, including the disciplined redeployment of excess cash into accretive acquisitions and share repurchase. We have completed six acquisitions so far in 2010. Four of these were in the risk and insurance services segment, including Haight (phon) Companies, Thomas Rutherford, and the Bostonian Group. These were part of our Marsh McLennan agency strategy. We also acquired the insurance broking operations of HSBC. In the third quarter, we completed two acquisitions at Mercer. In July we acquired Innovative Process Administration, a provider of health and benefit recordkeeping and employment enrollment technology; and in August we acquired ORC Worldwide, a premier provider of HR knowledge, data and solutions. Total consideration for these acquisitions exceeded $500 million, 300 million of which was in cash. This illustrates our capacity to make investments in our businesses. Another effective method of returning capital to shareholders and contributing to long-term growth in earnings per share is share repurchase. As I announced at investor day, the Board of Directors has authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. Since we have been in the blackout period related to third quarter earnings, we have not yet activated this program; however, now that we have announced our third quarter earnings, we will begin buying back our stock. Over time, effective capital management can translate compound annual growth of 10% into operating income to earnings per share growth approaching 13%. Another element that contributes to annual shareholder returns is MMC’s attractive dividend. Reflecting the recently announced dividend increase, our current yield is 3.2%. Long-term shareholder returns of 16% are what MMC was able to achieve during it’s first four decades as a public company, and this is what we are targeting for the future. The second pillar of our corporate strategy is maintaining low capital requirements. As a professional services firm, we do not require significant capital investments to successfully run our businesses. We therefore expect to maintain low capital requirements in each of our operating companies. In fact, we are targeting a level of capital expenditure in the coming year of approximately $230 million.  The third pillar is high cash generation. Our business generates strong cash flows; however, over the last few years we’ve used these cash flows to restructure operations and deal with legacy issues which averaged around $500 million per year, so our ability to reinvest in a classic growth manner was limited. Now that restructuring and legacy issues are largely behind us, we expect our businesses to generate over $1 billion of cash on an annual basis. Following dividend payments currently at 450 million, we’re left with approximately 550 million of excess cash that we can redeploy in acquisitions and share repurchase. And finally, lowering our risk profile. Over the next several years, we have implemented enhanced organizational, operational and risk management measures, including a focus on enterprise risk management, that are designed to reduce the Company’s risk profile.  To summarize, our strategy is to focus the Company on the characteristics that create great value for investors – growth, low capital requirements, high cash generation, and a low risk profile. It is our belief that emphasizing these four pillars, successfully combined with strong business operating in global markets and disciplined capital and expense management, should produce superior long-term returns to our shareholders.  Now let me turn it over to Vanessa to review our third quarter results in more detail.
Vanessa Wittman: Thank you, Brian, and good morning everyone. I’ll begin with an overview of MMC’s consolidated earnings for the quarter; then I’ll discuss the results of the individual operating companies. I’ll close with some observations regarding MMC’s financial position. On a GAAP basis, EPS in the third quarter was $0.30 which included $0.22 from continuing operations and $0.08 from discontinued operations. Discontinued operations primarily include the gain on the sale of Kroll, the related tax benefits, and Kroll’s operations in the third quarter. The related tax benefits were slightly higher than the preliminary tax benefit recognized in the second quarter. In the third quarter of 2009, adjusted EPS was $0.48 which, as you may recall, included an $0.18 tax benefit. On an adjusted basis, EPS in the third quarter of 2010 was $0.27. Adjusted EPS includes $4 million of operating income from Kroll through the closing of the sale. This compares with Kroll’s adjusted operating income of $21 million in the third quarter of 2009. Accordingly, the sale of Kroll negatively impacted this year’s third quarter by $0.02 a share. Due to declines in our private equity portfolio, which are recorded on a one quarter lag, we recorded an investment loss of $2 million in the third quarter. In last year’s third quarter, investment income was $22 million. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate investment income of approximately $15 million compared with $23 million in last year’s fourth quarter. Interest expense in the third quarter of $60 million was similar to prior quarters; however, with the repayment of the $550 million debt maturity in September, we expect interest expense to decrease beginning in the fourth quarter. Turning to the results of MMC’s operations, unless indicated otherwise, my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses, and adjusted operating income. We achieved growth in both revenue and operating income in each of our businesses, not only in the third quarter but for the first nine months of the year.  On a consolidated basis, operating income rose 7% to $269 million compared with last year’s third quarter. On a reported basis, third quarter revenue for risk and insurance services rose 8% to $1.3 billion. Excluding fiduciary interest income, underlying revenue growth was 3%. Operating income decreased 4% to $165 million from $158 million last year. Marsh had a strong quarter despite the continuation of soft market conditions in the global insurance market. On a reported basis, revenue rose 9% in the third quarter to $1.1 billion. On an underlying basis, growth was 3% reflecting a sequential improvement for the fourth quarter in a row. The strong performance in the third quarter was achieved with consistent revenue growth across all geographic operations. The positive momentum in new business generation also continued in the third quarter. Year-to-date, global new business growth was 8%. Client retention rates also stayed strong, in line with the first half of the year. Despite an increase in pension expense, growth in operating expenses was 3% in the quarter and only 1% for the first nine months. Guy Carpenter continued to generate revenue growth despite the significant headwinds of declines in pricing within the reinsurance markets and increased retentions by clients. On a reported basis, revenue increased 4% to $233 million. On an underlying basis, Carpenter’s revenue grew 3%. This is Carpenter’s seventh sequential quarter of revenue growth, an outstanding performance considering the operating environment. This growth reflects Carpenter’s high client retention and new business production, driven particularly by its international operations. This continues Carpenter’s strong new business over the past two years where it has gained market share from all segments within its competitive environment. In our consulting segment, reported revenue rose 5% to $1.2 billion. Underlying revenue growth was strong at 6%. This represents the third consecutive quarter of growth and the highest growth rate at consulting in the past nine quarters.  Growth in operating expenses, including higher pension expense, was 5% for the quarter and only 1% through the first nine months. Operating income increased 11% from $130 million to $144 million. For the nine months, operating income rose 16% from 335 million to $387 million with margin improvement of 110 basis points.  Mercer’s reported revenue increased 6% in the third quarter to $881 million. Underlying revenue growth was also 6%, a marked improvement compared with last year’s third quarter that felt the full impact of the global recession. Retirement consulting revenue, though down slightly from last year, was substantially stronger in the third quarter than the first half of this year, led by growth in Canada, Latin America, and Asia Pacific.  Health and benefits registered its strongest performance in two years. Revenue rose 8% in the third quarter driven by increases in the U.S. and Asia Pacific.  Rewards, talent and communications produced double digit revenue growth, it’s strongest performance since the first quarter of 2008. This was driven by growth in human capital consulting in the U.S., Canada, and EMEA as well as a resurgence of demand for compensation surveys. Outsourcing revenue was up 4% in the quarter driven by new client wins in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. Affirming our strategy to provide enhanced investment solutions for our clients’ retirement plans, investment consulting and management increased 17% for the third straight quarter with strong growth in all geographies. Mercer’s operating income increased in both the third quarter and year-to-date. Oliver Wyman also generated strong revenue growth in the third quarter which continues the improvement we have seen throughout this year. Reported revenue growth grew 3% to $322 million while underlying growth was 6%. Among its industry specialties, financial services representing almost 40% of revenue continued its outstanding performance. Revenue rose double digits for the third consecutive quarter, reflecting the improving demand from this sector. Oliver Wyman also generated strong growth in the healthcare, transportation, and consumer sectors. Oliver Wyman produced strong growth in operating income and margin improvement for both the third quarter and the first nine months of the year. Cash at the end of the third quarter was $1.7 billion compared with $1.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. In addition to our normal cash generation in the quarter, we received cash proceeds of $1.13 billion upon the closing of the Kroll transaction. Major uses of cash in the quarter included a $550 million debt maturity in September, $400 million for the Alaska settlement, a $200 million tax advantaged discretionary contribution to our U.S. pension plan, and $50 million for several small acquisitions. It’s important to note as I outlined at investor day that there are substantial tax benefits associated with some of these actions. For example, we expect to receive a cash tax benefit of roughly $280 million from the sale of Kroll. We achieved this benefit because we carried back a tax basis loss on the sale of Kroll against a gain on the sale of Putnam we realized in 2007. We also expect cash tax benefits of $160 million from the Alaska settlement and $70 million from our discretionary pension contribution.  So in aggregate, we have over $500 million of cash tax benefits. Roughly $200 million should be received by the end of this year, $230 million in the first half of 2011, with the remainder realized over time. As you heard Brian say, we expect to begin our share repurchase program shortly. With that, let me turn it back to Brian.
Brian Duperreault: Thank you, Vanessa. Operator, we’re ready to take questions.
Operator: Okay, thank you. The question and answer session today will be conducted electronically. If you’d like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your touchtone telephone. If you’re using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Once again, please press star, one on your touchtone telephone to queue for a question. We’ll pause for just a moment to assemble the queue. We’ll take our first question from Keith Walsh with Citi.
Keith Walsh – Citi: Hey, good morning everybody. Two questions – first, for Dan just on brokerage. The plus-3 admittedly a lot better than what I was looking for, at least. But what I want to understand is why the 50 basis point decline on the margin. Maybe if you could help me understand why we’re not seeing the operating leverage there; and then I’ve got a follow-up for Michele.
Daniel Glaser: Okay, so let me approach this in a couple of ways. One, you know that our revenue in the third quarter is the lowest revenue that we have in the year, you know, quarter-by-quarter. And our expense base does not reflect that same seasonality, so our expenses stay pretty stable over the course of the year. So changes in expense have a more material impact on the third quarter than they would in any other quarter. So specifically to your question, my management team and I are very much focused on making sure that expense growth does not exceed revenue growth. I mean, that’s sort of a basic operating principle. So in direct answer to your question, I think you’d have to look at pension expense and the growth that we had in pension expense this quarter. That represented about half of that 3% increase, and so from that standpoint it really masks in this quarter our underlying performance.
Keith Walsh – Citi: Okay, that’s helpful. And then for Michele, the same question basically but a little different. The plus-6 in consulting, again, much higher than I was looking for; but you got 60 BPs of margin but it seems your operating leverage in this business maybe isn’t as great as it is in brokerage. Can you maybe talk to that a little bit?
Michele Burns: Sure. I think first of all, we had the same issues as Dan in terms of a one-time or pension expense difference—different in that if you compare it year-over-year, you get a much different answer than you would on a run rate basis normally. So you have to take that out and think about that a little bit differently. Otherwise, I think the company is perhaps somewhat less leveraged than a brokerage company. That said, we are in the business of producing scale businesses, so whether it’s outsourcing, whether it’s capital management, whether it’s our data business, all these have scale characteristics. So our expectation is that you will see positive leverage in this business as we enter growth, and growth especially looking like the growth that we were able to produce this quarter.
Keith Walsh – Citi: Okay, thanks a lot.
Brian Duperreault: Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator: Yes, we’ll go next to Brian Meredith with UBS. 
Brian Meredith – UBS: Yeah, good morning. A couple questions here – the first one, back to Dan. Were there any headwinds in the quarter from the recent acquisition that you made, meaning was that a hurt to the margins potentially here?
Daniel Glaser: Well, the acquisitions overall for the year are not really going to do anything for us on the bottom line. I mean, they’ll be—I think in this quarter we had a 3 or $4 million benefit to earnings as a result of acquisitions, and so it’s overall—if you look at our acquisitions, the largest ones are the aggregate of the agencies, and you’ve got purchase accounting which works its way through, so from a margin standpoint won’t be a help for another two or three years. You know, we don’t have—because of our building with platform hubs, by definition we don’t have synergy with regard to those sort of acquisitions. And then our other large acquisition during the year was HSBC insurance brokers, and really we’ve spent this year getting that business right. And from that standpoint, the synergy value from that will show up next year.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Okay, great. And then can you talk a little bit about exposures, what you’re seeing out there from an exposure standpoint. Is it flattened out, getting any better?
Daniel Glaser: Yeah, I would guess on the overall margins you would say it’s getting a little bit better, but certainly nothing that makes us overly excited. I mean, I did think that we had very broad-based growth this quarter. I mean, if I just put that in context a little bit, we had 31 countries that grew more than 5% organically, and of those countries 19 of them grew more than 15%. So there’s definitely not only some exposure movement but there’s some projects that are being done that had been taken off the table a while back.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Great. And lastly could you just comment on the pipeline for M&A what it looks like?
Daniel Glaser: Yeah, the pipeline for M&A looks great. I mean, we’ve got—you know, Dave Eslick and his team within the agency are very active. We’re talking to a lot of people, and I’ll just reiterate – we don’t have a budget or a plan in terms of what we have to acquire and when. What we really have is a strategy, and that strategy is a multi-year strategy. And so we’re talking to a lot of people. The first thing is, is there a fit and does the management team have experience in doing fold-ins and bolt-ons and that sort of thing? And then of course the economics have to make sense. But I’m very pleased with where we are on a pipeline basis, and so you’ll be seeing us doing acquisitions over the course of the coming months and years. 
Brian Meredith – UBS: Excellent. Thank you.
Brian Duperreault:  Okay, Brian. Next question, please.
Operator: We’ll go next to Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.
Larry Greenberg – Langen McAlenney: Thank you and good morning. I guess this is for Vanessa. Is it too soon to give any color on pension expense for next year, and whether further contributions might be made this year?
Vanessa Wittman: Two pieces, I’m presuming, of your question, Larry. First, you’re spot on. It is too soon to make the call on next year’s pension expense. It’s a 12/31 calculation driven by the interrelationship of a lot of complicated factors. We also do not have a definitive plan for incremental contributions for the rest of this year.
Larry Greenberg – Langen McAlenney: Okay, thank you.
Brian Duperreault: You’re welcome, Larry. Next question, please.
Operator: We’ll go to Meyer Shields with Stifel Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields – Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks. Let me start with a question for Michele, if I can. Can you give us any guidance in terms of the relative margins within the various Mercer businesses? I’m asking because we’re seeing very varied organic revenue growth, and I’m trying to figure out what impact that has on the margins.
Michele Burns: We really don’t disclose relative margins, or even margins for Mercer individually. I think the way I might think about it is that the margin expansion you might see is particularly relevant in the scale businesses I mentioned in the last question.
Meyer Shields – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, that’s helpful. I guess—I don’t know if this is for Brian or Vanessa, but should we anticipate share repurchases over, let’s say, a longer period of time to outpace the shares issued either in compensation or in combination of compensation and acquisitions?
Brian Duperreault:  Well yeah, the point is to make—is to use the cash either through a repurchase or accretive acquisitions, so there is that competing situation. But with respect to share repurchases, certainly it would make sense to eliminate the dilution from the compensation side; and then with respect to the acquisitions, if they’re accretive, I guess I’m under less—I feel under less pressure if it was an accretive deal using stock as probably a good use of the stock, so I wouldn’t feel as compelled there. It’s more balance on future usages as opposed to what we did in the past, if that helps.
Meyer Shields – Stifel Nicolaus: Yeah, it does. And can we get any update on contingent commissions discussions that have been going on this year?
Brian Duperreault:  Contingent commissions discussions. I guess that’s you, Dan?
Daniel Glaser: Sure. I mean, I think from our perspective we’ve been pretty consistent and pretty clear. We believe that contingent commissions should be part of a broader discussion around carrier revenue streams, and that all carrier revenue streams have the potential for a conflict of interest and so therefore we’re really focused on the internal systems and controls we have to manage conflicts, and also our transparency and disclosure practices. You know, in terms of contingencies specifically, we have said that we do not intend to take contingent commissions in our core brokerage business in the U.S. and Canada, and actually probably in a few large countries as well. But having said this, it doesn’t mean that we’re not looking to improve our carrier revenue stream. So we’re actively negotiating with carriers on basic commissions levels, on enhanced commissions, on fee for services; and we’ve been successful throughout this year in doing that, and I believe that will continue.
Meyer Shields – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, thank you very much.
Brian Duperreault:  Okay, Meyer. Next question, please.
Operator: We’ll go to Adam Klauber with Macquarie.
Brian Duperreault:  Adam, are you there?
Operator: Adam, your line is open. Please check your mute function.
Brian Duperreault: Operator, why don’t we move to the next and maybe Adam can come back in?
Operator: We’ll go next to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay Cohen – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah, thank you. I just want to follow up on the pension expense going forward. While it’s too early, obviously, to forecast for next year, could you make an assessment though if you said things like interest rates, currency were going to remain the same for the balance of the year, given that assumption what would you expect for pension expense 2011 versus 2010?
Vanessa Wittman: Jay, I really think it’s misleading to make a call with even current interest rates when we’ve seen year-end volatility. For example, in 12/31/08, an overnight movement in the rate caused an incremental—fairly sizeable incremental expense. So I’m not comfortable speculating on today’s rates holding at 12/31.
Brian Duperreault: Yeah Jay, I think if we could do it, we’d do it. It’s just too complicated. It’s not fair for anybody, so when we have the number—you know, as soon as we feel confident, we’ll do it. I think we certainly did it last year when I did our fourth quarter earnings call, and we’ll certainly give you the information then.
Jay Cohen – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: That’s fine. That’s okay. We can wait for that, then. Second question – on the consulting side, can you talk about the revenue that’s associated with some of the deals that you completed in the quarter?
Brian Duperreault:  Michele?
Michele Burns: Sure. A couple of deals – the IPA and ORC, one in the outsourcing and the health and benefits arena, and the second in the mobility business. And the revenue characteristics will be helpful for us next year. We did see some revenue come through in this quarter with regard to ORC, but both of those are deals that will provide new capabilities for the firm that will lead to revenue growth both independently as well as in bundles. And in the case of IPA specifically, it will allow us to build out product and solutions that compliment our existing capabilities, so individual revenue from that organization as well as revenue growth, we will see coming because that product and solution just gets better with the IPA technology that we acquired.
Jay Cohen – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Can you quantify how much revenue they would add annually just from the deal that you—from the existing revenue that they had, just for modeling purposes from our standpoint. 
Michele Burns: Neither deal is significantly large in terms of revenue number. I would be hesitant to go off the top of my head, but I think maybe Mike can follow up with an estimate from what we’ve disclosed. Both of those deals, the way I would look at them from their incremental revenue from them alone will not be a material amount to Mercer overall, but as they are bundled with our other services they will add additional value. So it’s two pieces to that – organic from them alone as well as what we’re able to do with them as a bundle. I think it’s probably best that we come back to you on that one internally.
Michael Bischoff : Well as Michele said – this is Mike Bischoff – in our schedules you can see that for Mercer acquisitions, we’re 1% and that’s roughly 900 million, so it was about 8 or 9 million in the quarter, Jay.
Jay Cohen – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you.
Brian Duperreault: You’re welcome. Next question, please.
Operator: We’ll go next to Adam Klauber once again.
Adam Klauber – Macquarie Group: Thanks. Is the organic growth we’re seeing in brokerage, do you think that’s sustainable? And what sort of growth did you have in the U.K. and U.S.? 
Daniel Glaser: Okay, so a couple of things. As I’ve said in previous quarters, you know, it’s a difficult marketing environment and so it’s hard to actually see any real trend. I mean, I am happy that this is the fourth quarter in a row of sequential improvement in our growth levels, but it is a very challenging market particularly in mature markets. So when I look at the quarter and the year, we’re 1% year-to-date in terms of growth. We’re 3% in the quarter, and so I believe positive territory is sustainable but I wouldn’t necessarily say that any particular number within that range would be sustainable. I think we’d be in that range. The other thing is in terms of the U.S., we do disclose the U.S. Canada division – you know, Canada represents about 10% of the overall division, and that division’s growth in the quarter was 3%. We don’t disclose the U.K. separately from EMEA although I do want to say that the U.K. is the largest country by far in the EMEA division and that that division grew 1% in the quarter.
Adam Klauber – Macquarie Group: Great. One more follow-up – you talked about acquisitions. What’s the potential over the next 12 months to see a large sort of franchise defining-type acquisition?
Brian Duperreault: I guess I should answer that one, eh? Well, large franchise-changing acquisitions by definition aren’t that common, so you know; but the betting instincts in me would say it’s probably not a great chance. We have a strategy that I think is going to do us a great service over time, and that is each—and it’s not limited to Marsh. I mean, we are out, as Michele pointed, we have a couple of acquisitions at Mercer this quarter that keep the momentum going, add to our capabilities, enhance our franchise, fill us out; and if you go back to my four pillars, that growth – we want it to be sustainable. We want it to be long-term. We want you to be dependent on it. You could—of course, we’ve got to execute. So it’s not necessary for us to make those kinds of acquisitions. And when you look at our portfolio of companies, and I emphasized in the beginning we have four fabulous companies, and so they’re pretty good in their own right. It’s hard to find where we’re really so lacking that we need to make that change. However, having said all that, we are opportunists. If opportunities arise where we could do something that would absolutely be in your best interests and the rest of those who follow us and our shareholders, we’re going to do it; but frankly, you just can’t bet on those kinds of things, but you can, I think, more easily bet on our ability to find good quality companies that add year after year, year after year, to the Company. And that’s the strategy we’re employing.
Adam Klauber – Macquarie Group: Great. Thank you very much.
Brian Duperreault:  You’re welcome. Next question?
Operator: We’ll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital:  Thanks. My first question is what’s the expectation for issuance of shares as related to compensation?
Brian Duperreault: Well I think if you look at our history, it’s fairly consistent. I don’t think we have any plans to do something out of norm with what we’ve done in the past. I don’t think I can say anything more than that, Jay.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Okay. Have you quantified that at all?
Brian Duperreault:  We go through the process starting soon when we evaluate the year. Of course, we have to—it is based on performance so performance isn’t quite finished yet. But we have budgets and plans and expectations, but the actual quantification takes a little more time.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: I see. And then more broadly, can you talk about the potential to expand the risk and insurance services adjusted margin in 2011? It looks like it’ll be mostly unchanged in 2010, so just wanted to give you an opportunity to maybe talk about next year.
Brian Duperreault:  Well, long-term it’s our plan to expand. We’re going to expand that margin kind of the old-fashioned way, right? We’re going to continue organic growth and manage our expenses. We believe we can do that over time. Now 2011, you know, we may have some more headwinds as Dan pointed out. We’ve continued to have headwinds in both economics and in the soft market conditions that we’re facing, the low interest rates, all of those things. Pensions, you know, have been an issue. So it just makes the job a little harder but the expectation is we will find some way to get the margins expanding. I don’t know what 2011’s margin’s going to be, but it’s certainly our plan to continue to maintain the discipline around both playing offense and defense.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Thank you.
Brian Duperreault: You’re welcome, Jay.
Operator: Well go next to Thomas Mitchell with Miller Tabak.
Thomas Mitchell – Miller Tabak: Miller Tabak, yes. As I understood the discussion, you have dedicated all the proceeds of the Kroll sale but you’re expecting major tax benefits in cash form coming in in the fourth quarter and next year. Is it reasonable to assume that you will redeploy most of those cash tax benefits to share repurchases?
Brian Duperreault: Well, Thomas, it’s a nice position to be in when we have the cash. I pointed out we’ve been in—you know, we’ve been putting cash out for other reasons. Now we can actually use it, and I told you what we would do. Once we pay the dividend, we look at the rest of this cash we either have on hand or we’re generating, and we’re looking for accretive acquisitions or share repurchase. So those are the two choices and they remain the two choices, and I’m not going to handicap which one’s going to get most of the money.
Thomas Mitchell – Miller Tabak: Okay, thanks.
Brian Duperreault: Okay.
Operator: And I’ll turn it back over to Mr. Duperreault for closing remarks.
Brian Duperreault: Okay, well thank you very much. Thanks for joining us today and for your continued interest in the company. And before I close, I just want to make sure that if you haven’t seen the investor’s day presentation, go to mmc.com. I think you’ll find it very interesting and again, thank you and we’ll talk to you next quarter. Bye.
Operator: This concludes today’s presentation. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to MMC's Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Second quarter 2010 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on MMC's website at www.mmc.com.  Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. In particular, references during the conference call to anticipated or expected results of operations for 2010 or subsequent periods are forward-looking statements, and MMC's actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. Please refer to MMC's most recent SEC filings, as well as the company's earnings release, which are available on the MMC website. For additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today.  I will now turn the call over to Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC.
Brian Duperreault: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me in presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. I'd also like to welcome our operating company's CEOs to today's call: Dan Glaser of Marsh; Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter; Michele Burns of Mercer; John Drzik of Oliver Wyman; and Ben Allen of Kroll, who is joining us for his last MMC conference call. Also, with us is Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations.  I'll begin by making several comments, then turn it over to Vanessa to discuss our financial results. After that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Let me start by saying I am pleased to report that MMC continued to make progress in the second quarter, producing strong earnings performance. Our operating companies continue to do an excellent job in managing their respective businesses. Our performance is impressive given the continued challenges presented by soft market conditions in the global property, casualty, commercial insurance marketplace, which shows no signs of abating and the overall weak economic environment in the developed markets.  Insurance industry capital remains plentiful. Insured losses have been within normalized ranges and competition among underwriters remains intense. As I joined MMC as CEO in early 2008, I and the rest of the senior management team has spent considerable time and effort on resolving a number of legacy issues that prevented the company from operating at its fullest potential. I've mentioned several of these on previous calls, including the matters within Marsh that substantially depressed its operating performance through 2007. Marsh's performance has improved dramatically since then, due to the efforts of Marsh's senior management team, led by Dan Glaser, its CEO.  Changes were also needed at Guy Carpenter. Peter Zaffino was appointed CEO in early 2008 and has overseen an impressive turnaround as evidenced by re-energized new business production, strict expense control and improved profitability. As an organization, we also had to adapt to the requirements imposed by the agreement reached with the New York Attorney General in 2005. For several years, we were required to compete on an unlevel playing field. We are gratified that with our involvement and perspective, the New York regulators revised the agreement earlier this year, leveling the playing field for Marsh and other large brokers. Additionally, we recently addressed two other significant matters. The sale of Kroll and the settlement of the Alaska litigation. Over the past six years, Kroll has been a valued member of the MMC family. However, after careful analysis we concluded that MMC's long-term strategy should be the focus on our Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting businesses. We ran a very tightly-managed process for assessing the market value of Kroll, culminating in an agreement to sell Kroll to Altegrity, which we announced in June. Altegrity, an international screening and securities solutions firm, should be a superb partner for Kroll. We expect the deal to close this week, nearly two months earlier than originally projected. I want to thank Ben Allen for his leadership of Kroll over the last two years and recognize the tremendous efforts that he and his team undertook to ensure a successful transaction for MMC's shareholders. We wish Ben and his colleagues continued success with their new partners.  In June, we settled the Alaska litigation against Mercer. Given the uncertainty of the jury trial in Juneau where a high percentage of residents have a direct connection to the retiree medical plans involved in the litigation, we determined that a settlement was in MMC's best interest. I would like to take this opportunity to give special recognition to Peter Beshar, MMC's Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Peter has done an outstanding job in managing the complex legal matters faced by MMC in recent years. In summary, due to the hard work and dedication of our colleagues and the leadership demonstrated by our management team over the past two and a half years, we have addressed a number of issues that has impeded our ability to operate at full strength. Moving forward, our goal is to establish MMC as a world-class growth company, not just in relation to our direct competitors, but with respect to other leading global companies. Generating superior, long-term total return for shareholders was a hallmark of MMC's first four decades as a public company. We believe we can achieve this status once again because of our leading market positions and the long-term growth characteristics of our businesses. To return to this record of performance, we will focus on four major pillars in the coming years: growth, low capital requirements, generating high levels of cash and lowering MMC's risk profile. I'll touch briefly on these. First, earnings growth. We are committed to generating long term, sustainable revenue and earnings growth. Within each of our businesses and our global footprint, MMC should produce long-term organic revenue growth augmented by acquisitions at least equal to global GDP growth. A continuing focus on expense discipline, which is even more important during the cyclical downturns, will expand margins and lead to superior long-term earnings growth. The second is low capital requirements. As a professional services firm, we don't require significant capital investments to successfully run our businesses. Unlike an insurance underwriter, MMC is not capital intensive and should not require a large balance sheet. We expect to maintain low capital requirements in each of our businesses.  Third is high cash generation. Our businesses generate strong operating cash flow. As a result of MMC's cash earnings, we should equal or exceed our reported earnings. With long-term earnings per share growth, low capital requirements and the completion of the bulk of our restructuring activities, we should generate significant cash flow in future years. Fourth and finally, the lowering of our risk profile. In addressing the legacy issues earlier, I noted we had made important progress in reducing the overall risk characteristics of MMC. In addition, we have implemented enhanced organizational, operational and risk management measurements that should contribute to further reducing the company's risk profile.  To summarize, it is our belief that the successful execution of these four pillars over the next several years will restore MMC to its preeminent position as a global growth company. With a clear strategic direction, a strong competitive position, a cohesive management team and long-term growth prospects, we embrace the challenges of the future. We will provide more insights into MMC's operational and financial characteristics on September 30, when we will host an Investor Day in New York. We are in the process of sending out invitations to members of the investment community. We hope we will have the opportunity to have you join us.  Now let me turn it over to Vanessa.
Vanessa Wittman: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. There are several areas I'll cover today. First, I'll give an overview of MMC's consolidated earnings for the quarter. Next, I'll discuss the results of the individual operating companies. And finally, I'll close with some observations regarding MMC's cash position. On a GAAP basis, EPS in the second quarter of 2010 was $0.43 due to the inclusion of the Alaska settlement, we had a $0.06 loss from continuing operations. Kroll is now classified as a discontinued operation. A significant tax benefit from this pending disposition results in earnings from discontinued operations of $0.49 per share. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.46, an increase of 28% from $0.36 in last year's second quarter. For a more appropriate earnings comparisons, Kroll's operating results are included in adjusted earnings for all periods. Kroll contributed $0.03 to adjusted EPS in the second quarter, with an 8% increase in underlying revenue and strong growth in profitability and margins. To assist the investment community with financial modeling, the supplemental schedules included with this morning's press release detail the reclassification for the first quarter of 2010 as well as the four quarters of 2009. Turning to the results of MMC's continuing operations, unless specifically indicated, my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expense and adjusted operating income. On a consolidated basis, MMC's operating income rose 8% compared with last year's second quarter. Investment income was $18 million in the quarter, primarily due to mark-to-market gains at Trident II. This is compared with a loss of $32 million last year.  Looking ahead to the third quarter, we currently anticipate an investment loss in the third quarter of $5 million, a negative swing in EPS of $0.04 from the third quarter of 2009. Corporate expenses decreased from $38 million to $36 million, consistent with the positive trends we saw in the first quarter. The effect of foreign currency translation on MMC's earnings in the second quarter was de minimis, with a slight positive at Risk and Insurance Services and a slight negative in the Consulting segment. Next, I'd like to review the performance of our operating segments. On a reported basis, second quarter revenue for Risk and Insurance Services rose 9% to $1.5 billion, and underlying growth was 1%. Operating income increased 11% from $271 million to $302 million. In the second quarter, we began the process of integrating the operations of HSBC Insurance Brokers into both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Additional restructuring charges will be incurred in the second half of the year.  Marsh's second quarter revenue rose 9% on a reported basis to $1.2 billion. On an underlying basis, revenue growth was 1%, reflecting an improvement from the first quarter. In fact, Marsh's generated sequential improvement since the third quarter last year from minus 2% to minus 1% to flat, and now to growth of 1% in the second quarter. Marsh's international operations, particularly Asia Pacific and Latin America, drove revenue growth.  The positive momentum in new business generation has continued in the second quarter with strong new business growth of 11% globally. Even while investing significant amounts back into the business and with higher pension expense, operating expenses decreased 1% in the quarter. This resulted in growth in Marsh's operating income and margin. Guy Carpenter continued to generate revenue growth in the second quarter despite significant headwinds, including declines in both primary and reinsurance pricing, increased retentions by clients and declines in insurance exposures. On a reported basis, revenue increased 7% to $243 million, primarily due to acquisitions. Underlying growth was 2%, reflecting the sixth sequential quarter of growth, and excellent performance. This revenue growth reflects Carpenter's strong revenue retention rate and new business production, led by its international operations. Cost containment efforts contributed to solid growth in operating income in the quarter.  In our Consulting segment, reported revenue rose 2% to $1.2 billion. Underlying growth was also 2%, the second consecutive quarter of growth. Operating expenses, including higher pension costs, were held to 2% growth. Operating income decreased slightly from $131 million to $127 million. For the six months, operating income rose 19% from $205 million to $243 million with growth in the operating margin of 130 basis points.  Mercer's reported revenue increased 1% in the second quarter to $838 million. Underlying revenue was down 1%, unchanged from the first quarter. In the second quarter, global demand for retirement consulting remain subdued as clients were generally reluctant to commit to discretionary work, similar to the first quarter. Health and benefits grew 2% for the third consecutive quarter. We saw growth in all of the major geographies except the U.S.  Outsourcing revenue was stable in the quarter. Affirming our strategy, investment consulting and management increased 17% for the second consecutive quarter with very strong growth in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific.  Oliver Wyman generated strong revenue growth in the second quarter. Reported revenue grew 6% to $330 million and underlying growth was 8%. This continues the improving fundamentals that began to emerge at the end of 2009. Among its industry specialties, Financial Services, representing almost 40% of revenue, continued its strong performance.  Revenue rose double digits in the second quarter, reflecting the improving health of this sector. A number of other business sectors, most notably manufacturing and transportation also saw solid growth. Oliver Wyman generated growth in operating income and margin improvement, not only in the second quarter, but also year-to-date.  Cash at the end of the second quarter was $1.5 billion, and upon the closing of the Kroll transaction we will receive cash proceeds of $1.13 billion. Additionally, we expect to receive an accumulated cash tax benefit of roughly $260 million, resulting from not only this disposition, but the sale of operations within Risk Consulting and Technology over the past two years. We expect to receive this cash tax benefit over the next six to nine months. On August 10, we will have an outflow of cash of $400 million, representing the Alaska settlement, net of insurance. We have a $550 million debt maturity in September that we will fund with cash. We have no other debt maturing until March 2012.  With that, let me turn it back to Brian.
Brian Duperreault: Thanks, Vanessa. We're ready for your questions. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Keith Walsh with Citi.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: First question, for Brian, I asked you this a few quarters ago, but in light of the M&A we've seen in the Consulting side of the business recently, what is your view on M&A? Would you allocate capital to the Consulting side of the business or is it brokerage only? Or how should we think about that?
Brian Duperreault: Keith, I'd say that's great. It's nice to be in a position where we can talk about that. We've articulated our strategy with respect to the brokerage with the Marsh & McLennan agencies and done some other acquisitions, and we were behind in that area because, with the issues at Marsh, it wouldn't make any sense to put additional companies together with it. But that's changed, and so we've been devoting our energies to the brokerage side. But that doesn't mean that acquisitions are not in the future of the Consulting. Certainly, we have been doing that over time, and I would expect that to continue. I think it's really a reflection of the fact that we had not been addressing the needs of the brokerage side. And so that's -- I think you'll see acquisitions going forward, and I mentioned that in my growth comments.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: And then second question, for Michelle, just one of the things in the release that caught my eye is, in the footnotes there's an extra -- or a split out of $30 million of incremental professional liability costs within the Consulting business. And if you could just give us some more color behind that? Does that mean that, going forward, we've got to think about margins being lower as a result of higher professional liability costs?
Brian Duperreault: Well, let me do it this way. How about Vanessa talks about that footnote, and then Michelle can talk about margins. So Vanessa, why don't you start.
Vanessa Wittman: Sure, Keith, I think what you're referring to is where we walk through our non-GAAP measures. And what we did was, we -- in order to make the quarter-to-quarter comparison more meaningful because we have qualified Alaska as a noteworthy, we also stripped that $30 million in the adjusted for the second quarter 2009. Otherwise, you would see an inflated margin improvement quarter-to-quarter. So that's the $30 million.
Brian Duperreault: But Michelle, you want to talk a little bit about the margins?
M. Burns: Yes, I think the underlying question is what to expect from the Consulting segment, and perhaps doesn't -- in particular. And the way that I would view our margins pickup, if you will, is as follows. First of all, I've talked before about the amount of work that we have put in as a company in terms of two things. First of all, retooling, in general, our infrastructure to better be able to leverage our business across all the geographies that we have. And secondly, we spent a significant amount of effort to retool our risk profile. And those efforts started in 2005 and '06 and have continued over the last four years so that our risk profile is different. In fact, I believe our risk is much better managed at this point in time. I think thirdly, it's important to remember that Mercer undertook a strategy about 2005, 2006 that should build out its three pillars. Our Consulting segment is quite strong. From a margin perspective, outsourcing and investments we have been growing and investing in. So we talk about a lot about M&A with this company and M&A being inorganic. But there is a way to look at Mercer that says that there's been a significant amount of organic M&A by building out outsourcing and investments. So in summary, if you look at that profile, we have two businesses that we've been investing in for five years that are rapidly maturing in terms of their infrastructure, as well as a better infrastructure overall, which would lead to an expectation of expanded margins for some time to come.
Operator: We'll go next to Larry Greenberg, Langen McAlenney.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: I was wondering if you could give us what new business is running as a percentage of base revenues in both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. And then secondly, just curious about your decision to pay down debt with cash and how you're thinking about the kind of the excess cash that's come on board through the Kroll acquisition vis-à-vis stock buyback opportunity, debt pay down, other uses.
Brian Duperreault: I'll do that last, so why don't we have Dan and Peter talk about this new business question.
Daniel Glaser: Sure. Well, you can do the math, Larry, but I would tell you that new business within Marsh on a total basis in the quarter was $229 million, so that was 11% growth. And as we reported before in the first quarter, it was about $221 million. And so it's been very healthy and that growth level has been expanding as well. So with 7% growth of new business in the first quarter, 11% growth in the second quarter.
Peter Zaffino: And we have similar numbers. Our new business represents 11% of our total revenue for the second quarter. One very positive sign for Guy Carpenter is 20% of our new business came from clients that we did not have prior,,where historically, we've been running about 10%. So we're keeping very good pace with our new business, but also picking up a lot of new clients.
Brian Duperreault: So talking about -- just general question about the use of cash. And as I mentioned in our four pillars, cash generation is going to be one of the hallmarks of this company, once again. And it should have always been, but we'll get back to where we were. And I said it's a wonderful position to be in. We don't need much capital, as I said earlier. So what do you do with the cash? Once we get past our dividend policy, which should be significant, we would return it to shareholders in different ways. And I think the best way, frankly, is to continue to grow this company. As we ask about M&A earlier, I would use the cash for M&A purposes. We have a pipeline in the agency side, potential for the Consulting. So it is a question of what is best for the shareholders, what's the best return. In that equation, one has to consider the question of stock buybacks, so it would be a use if it is the best use for the ultimate benefit. But my preference has always been to grow the company and to find good strategic partners that make the company greater. And that's how this company has grown over time, and I think that's the way it's going to continue to grow.
Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Do you view the cash coming from the Kroll divestiture differently than operating cash generation vis-à-vis the alternatives for deploying it?
Brian Duperreault: Well, yes, I guess it does have special significance, since we have to replace the earnings. But all cash is that way, all cash is that way. But yes, I think you're really saying, are we focusing on finding ways of continuing our earnings growth, best use of cash. And the answer is, yes, we are looking for the best way to use cash in general and that one in particular to continue our earnings growth.
Operator: We'll go next to Cliff Gallant with KBW.
Cliff Gallant - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: I wanted to ask about the 4% decline in the underlying revenue at the U.S. Canada operations in the Broker business? I think in the first quarter you had a positive 1%, and I'm just curious what caused the quarter-to-quarter shift.
Daniel Glaser: Sure. I'll take that. It's Dan. The conditions in the U.S. remain challenging for us and our competitors. When you're in such a market, there really is no trend and we see that in our results. The underlying fundamentals in the market really make it tough to generate any kind of consistency, and the result is that a few key pieces of business falling in one quarter or another really change the results so change the numbers quite a bit. That said, I'm very pleased with how the U.S. business and Canadian business is actually performing. We've had solid new business in the U.S. Canada division as an example, $89 million, which was 6% growth part of the overall $229 million in the quarter. Our account retention levels are still very strong in the low 90s. And actually not only strong, but very stable with where they were last year as well. So the basic business is performing, and I don't believe that the minus four represents a new trend. I think that we're more likely, that you'll look at that as a six-month trend rather than a quarter.
Cliff Gallant - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: It sounds like you're saying, it's more of a timing issue quarter-to-quarter, not lost clients, or something like that.
Daniel Glaser: Yes, we're going to be -- I mean, the market itself in the U.S. has very strong downward rate environment, exposure units have been down. That's beginning to abate somewhat. But it's still a soft market, getting softer. So from that perspective, I look at a whole number of different metrics new business, RFP performance, our retention of key personnel, our ability to hire in the market and strategic recruiting. And when I look at the overall business, I'm comfortable where it is and I think it's doing well. And in terms of trend line, I'm comfortable that I wouldn't pin it exactly to timing, but I am comfortable that we're sort of bouncing around a little bit and that we're just as likely to have a decent quarter of next, as we were having what I viewed as not a stronger top line as I would like in the second.
Operator: We'll go next to Meyer Shields, Stifel, Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: In both Brokerage and Consulting, there's sort of wide variation in the individual businesses organic growth rate. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the implications for margins.
Brian Duperreault: I don't know. Do you want to do this one, Dan and Michelle?
Daniel Glaser: Sure. I'll start. I mean, when I look at -- well, one, we're a global company. We have operations on the ground in 90 different countries, and I would say the level of GDP growth is very variable. The level of project work is really variable as well. Our underlying growth in -- and by the way, I'm an internationalist. So growth is growth, it doesn't matter much to me as to whether it's appearing in one spot or another, we run our business as a firm. When I look at our overall business in international growing 6% in the quarter, with really very strong growth in both Asia Pacific and also Latin America, and decent growth, 3% growth in EMEA. So it was really very broad based. More than 35 countries or territories grew more than 5% for us in the second quarter and 20 of those grew more than 15%. So I feel very good about where we're performing on a growth standpoint. And to me, margin -- there are -- we clearly are interested in growing our margin over time. As you know, it's a lot easier to do that when you're moving the top line. Having said that though, we focused on aligning our expense base with our revenues. So I'm quite comfortable that even in a very low growth environment, we would still be able to move our margins. We have a bit of a headwind now because as you know, our pension expense has grown a little bit. But in our view, we have just really started on looking at our business in a strategic way, reducing the number of process steps, creating less variability on how we handle business. And that will take, in my view, a significant amount of cost out of the business over the coming few years.
Brian Duperreault: Michelle, could you touch in on that?
M. Burns: Absolutely. I'll talk about it across the three pillars with the slight decomposition on Consulting. Between the six months to three months, we're seeing improvement in Consulting. We improved about one percentage point, still negative, but it's going in the right direction. The Retirement business remains subdued for those economic reasons, as well as the nature of that business. I think it's important to remember in Retirement that it is a big component of that Consulting number that we had positive growth in the second quarter and the first quarter of 2009, which is a little bit unusual. So as we continue to come off those comparabilities I think we'll see some growth in Retirement. Our H&B is showing some growth. And importantly, while Talent and Rewards is still negative, it is improving significantly quarter-over-quarter. So overall, we see a 3% decline in our Consulting business. But as you decompose it, it's actually some signs of positive things. The Talent and Rewards business tends to be the business that leads the way in terms of being a bit of a shift. I've took some optimism from that, not just about Mercer's business, but perhaps about the economic environment, which is still quite uncertain and bouncing around along the geographies. But at least in that area, it typically is an area that gives us some indication of what people are willing to spend discretionary dollars on. Outsourcing is doing what we expected to do. It's a strong business that's stable and it's continuing to have a strong pipeline of sale, which we will see, show up in 2011. So I think it's doing what we expected to do as the second pillar of a three-pillar strategy. And investments is doing exactly the same thing, investment has 17% growth across the six months and it's very exciting for us and also producing quarter-after-quarter. So I think both of those things together are important. When I step back from the Consulting basis doing more or less what one might expect in an uncertain economy with growth showing up in the right places, outsourcing holding stable and then investments leading the way with significant growth rates. And so as I've look at it, I feel pretty comfortable with where we are and continue to believe that Mercer's going to show overall growth in the low single digits some time during this year.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And if I could just get Vanessa's comment on tax rate expectations going forward?
Brian Duperreault: Tax expectations?
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes.
Vanessa Wittman: We would expect it to be at just about 31% for the full year, Meyer.
Operator: We'll go next to Jay Gelb, Barclays Capital.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Two questions, one for Dan and one for Michele. For Dan, can you talk about the outlook for contingent commissions, in light of how each of the major three brokers are now approaching this issue somewhat differently? And then for Michelle, can you talk about how you think about the competitive dynamic in Consulting now, with an anticipated combination between Aon and Mercer?
Daniel Glaser: I'll start, Jay. First of all, in regard to contingent commissions, we've been very consistent in our approach. As I've said before, the broader issue in our mind relate to all carrier revenue streams and the potential conflicts of interest that they present. All brokers, all of them, receive carrier compensation in one form or another and each of these arrangements requires a good system of internal controls to manage those conflicts. So I do think that the view that contingent commissions could represent the only conflict of interest facing insurance brokers is simplistic and actually wrong. In our view recently, Aon announced a change in their position. I respect their position. But as we've said, we do not intend to pursue contingent commissions on our Brokerage business in the U.S. and Canada. In other parts of our business around the world, though, we will consider taking them where appropriate. And one of the things is, over the last couple of years, we have been pursuing higher retail commissions and enhanced commissions now successfully. And so I don't see a material uplift certainly in the near term from our release from the settlement agreement. And enhanced yield, in terms of higher retail commission or enhanced commission or fee-for-services types of payment are an integral part of our revenue stream and their recurring revenues and they're very different from contingents. So on that basis, we don't plan on separately disclosing them.
Brian Duperreault: Michelle, why don't you talk about the Aon, Hewitt issue?
M. Burns: Sure. From that perspective, the move -- Aon, Hewitt move, does two things. First of all, it presents a stabilizing market environment. So we evolve into three similarly-sized large competitors in a marketplace with a lot of smaller fractured competitors below that. And so the stabilizing industry structure in what we hope is a stabilizing market environment is certainly a good thing to me. Secondly, the move is a clear, if you will, endorsement of the Mercer three-pillar strategy, and a lot of a conversation around that acquisition confirms our strategy, which we believe very strongly as you hear me say quarter-after-quarter. And so I feel very good about that. And then finally, I believe that our business is quite strong. We have had to -- through this significant recession, we have done less damage to our Consulting organization of this size and scope than one might expect. And given that we are well positioned to spring forward as we hope the economy begins to recover and deploy all our assets in the marketplace right away. I feel very good about it. I think from their perspective, it's a logical move and then generally for the industry and specifically for Mercer, it's a good playing field for us to compete against them.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: And then, just one fast one for Vanessa. That $260 million of cash tax benefit, is there any impact on the P&L from that? Or is that just on cash?
Vanessa Wittman: It's already in the disc ops calculation. If you flip to the schedule on Page 12, Jay, it's probably the easiest place for you to track through.
Operator: We'll go next to Adam Klauber, Macquarie.
Adam Klauber - Macquarie Research: Just checking in on Asia Pacific/Latin America, obviously very strong recently. Do you think those growth rates are sustainable? Or is that more just coming off obviously tougher 2009 levels?
Daniel Glaser: Yes. I mean, it's interesting because we, as a group, were recently in China and I wouldn't set -- I spent some time before that in other parts of Asia the previous week. I would not set any bars on what our expectations are. This is a high-growth optimistic building region. And so from that perspective, I wouldn't want to set any management expectation that reduces the amount of potential that we have in those businesses. I'm very excited about those businesses. We've invested in people in those businesses, and I certainly don't believe that a double-digit growth rate would be unusual in a normal economic environment.
Brian Duperreault: We were just -- we had our board meeting in Beijing and Shanghai because of the significance we see for China, and specifically in Asia in general. And it is where the dramatic amount of growth is taking place globally. And interestingly, what we do for a living, this Consulting business, whether it's in Broking or it's HR, general strategic is somewhat of a late developing aspect to economies. And so it's kind of like our turn now. So we would expect a significant growth for quite a long time to come.
Adam Klauber - Macquarie Research: One follow-up, is there any signs that in the Consulting, benefits/healthcare that, that pipeline is opening up?
Brian Duperreault: Michelle?
M. Burns: Yes, let me answer that question for the U.S. and then for the rest of the world, specifically Asia Pacific. The Consulting pipeline, especially at that complex higher end is very strong and we saw some of that in second quarter and expect that to continue, as you would expect, as a result of U.S. legislation. So in that regard, it's quite strong there. Now the business is quite different all around the world. We do see good growth in EMEA and H&B and we also have seen some nice growth and double-digits growth coming out of Asia Pacific and H&B as a result of flex benefit plan that employers are putting in. So overall, the H&B business is strong. We focused a lot on the U.S. because it is a very significant part of that portfolio and it is also strong with regard to Consulting services, and it's growing and stabling and beginning to grow with regard to the Brokerage Services. The differential with the Brokerage end is that we are still lapping headcount reductions and that revenue is driven strictly by that. So I think you would see -- could expect to see that moderate and then again, the comps to come around and see growth in H&B in general supported by a stronger U.S. growth.
Operator: We'll go next to Thomas Mitchell, Miller Tabak.
Thomas Mitchell - Miller Tabak: Two sort of separate issues, and you're sort of on the first one now, but let me come back to this question of the professional liability expenses. It's unclear to me whether that is a new level of recurring expenses, or whether that is a one-off expense that was tied to the settlement. Which was it?
Brian Duperreault: Well, Thomas, Vanessa will answer that.
Vanessa Wittman: Thomas, if you go to Page 9 on the schedules, that's probably the easiest place to see it. The Alaska settlement is indeed a one-time settlement. The reason that you see the professional liability included for the three months June 30, 2009, is so that you see more consistent margin comparability within Consulting. If it were excluded, the margin expansion would be overstated. So it's in there as a onetime, not a recurring.
Thomas Mitchell - Miller Tabak: The second question, and I don't know if you can answer this, but when Hewitt filed an S-4 on their deal, they put a great deal of emphasis on the fact that they had discussions with company X, and company X sure looks like, sounds like and flies like MMC. And with company X, they reported that company X approached them, then they countered by approaching company X to make a bid for their Consulting businesses, and then they both ended up walking away. To put it interestingly, is Hewitt not too big? Is a company the size of Hewitt not too big for you to buy into, to take over?
Brian Duperreault: Well, I thought you're going to ask me a different question, which I wouldn't comment on. But I think we have -- we certainly have the potential to make large acquisitions. There's no question about that. And it's our job to find the ones that fit the best for us and match the strategic direction we're taking for the best degree.
Operator: And at this time, with no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Brian Duperreault: Okay. Well, thank you very much, and thanks, everybody for your attention. And so I just want to maybe take a moment just to emphasize our commitment on growth. We're a growth company, and we're going to get back to growing and you should look for that. And when we talk to you, September 30 at our Investment Day in New York, we hope to continue that dialogue. So once again, thank you, and goodbye.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation.

Operator: Welcome to the MMC's conference call. [Operator Instructions] First quarter 2010 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the MMC website at www.mmc.com.  Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. In particular, references during this conference call to anticipated or expected results of operations for 2010 or subsequent periods are forward-looking statements, and MMC's actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. Please refer to the MMC's most recent SEC filings as well as the company's earnings release which are available on MMC's website for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn over this call to Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC.
Brian Duperreault: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me in presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. I'd also like to welcome our operating company's CEOs to today's call: Dan Glaser of Marsh, Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter, Michele Burns of Mercer, John Drzik of Oliver Wyman, and Ben Allen of Kroll. Also with us is Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations. I'll begin with some brief comments on the quarter before turning it over to Vanessa to provide additional information regarding our financial results. Then we would be happy to take your questions. I am pleased to report that Marsh & McLennan’s Companies first quarter earnings performance was very encouraging. Vanessa will go into more detail, but let me say that each of our operating companies is doing an excellent job in managing their respective businesses including carefully controlling their operating expenses. Our performance is all the more impressive in light of the substantial challenges presented by the global recession. Despite signs that recessionary conditions are ebbing, economic weakness continues to affect our operating segments.  Also, we continue to face soft market conditions in the global property-casualty commercial insurance marketplace. We are now in a seventh year of price declines and, frankly, we see no indication that the overall insurance market will change any time soon. In addition to successfully managing Marsh and Guy Carpenter through extremely turbulent times, Dan, Peter and their management teams are continuing to position their businesses for the future.  In the first quarter, several positive trends that Marsh has generated over the past two years continued: growth in new business, solid client revenue retention rates, and a focus on controlling operating expenses. At the same time, management is implementing its strategy to improve operational efficiencies, strength in financial results and deliver superior risk and insurance capabilities to clients. And with its improved operating performance, Marsh is turning its attention to growth.  In the past six months, we've announced seven acquisitions, the largest being HSBC Insurance Brokers. HSBC is a strong fit with Marsh, both operationally and geographically. The transaction was closed April 1, deepens Marsh's presence in the U.K., Hong Kong, Singapore, China and the Middle East. This acquisition should add annualized revenue of approximately $200 million.  As part of this acquisition, we have also entered into a strategic partnership but HSBC Bank, one of the largest banks in the world, in giving us preferred access to provide insurance broking and risk-management services to HSBC and their corporate and private clients.  Five of our recently-announced acquisitions are part of the Marsh & McLennan Agency initiative. On last quarter's call, I mentioned that we acquired Insurance Alliance, based in Houston; NIA Group, based in New Jersey; and in February of this year, we acquired Haake Companies, based in Kansas. In March, we announced our largest agency acquisition yet, Thomas Rutherfoord, Inc., based in Virginia. Rutherfoord, with revenues exceeding $80 million, has more than 300 employees located from Philadelphia to the Gulf Coast.  And yesterday, we announced the acquisition of Bostonian Group, one of the largest regional brokerages in New England. The firm specializes in employee benefits and has a revenue of approximately $14 million. As you know, our strategy for the Marsh & McLennan Agency initiative is to establish about 10 hubs throughout the United States. As you can see, we’re making great progress toward this objective.  Guy Carpenter's results in the first quarter of 2010 reflect the positive themes we've talked about for the past year: excellent new business development, strong client revenue retention that remains at historically high levels, and a disciplined approach to expense management. Together, these factors resulted in underlying revenue growth in the quarter, which is impressive when you consider the difficult operating environment and that Guy Carpenter achieved the 10% increase in underlying revenue growth in the first quarter of last year.  Furthermore, management continued to implement its strategy to grow internationally and to enhance its industry-leading analytical capabilities, while at the same time expanding operating income. We recently announced that Vicky Carter will join Guy Carpenter in September as Vice Chairman, which will further strengthen the Carpenter’s international operations. Vicky has more than 30 years of experience in the reinsurance industry. Based in London, she will report to Henry Keeling, President and CEO of Guy Carpenter, International. She joins Carpenter from Towers Watson, where she served as Chairman of the U.K. international operations. Finally, Carpenter will enhance its capabilities this year when it releases three industry-leading analytical models that will deliver significant value to clients. Moving on to our Consulting segment, both Mercer and Oliver Wyman have been feeling the effects of the economic downturn for the past two years. However, growth and profitability re-emerged in the fourth quarter of last year and accelerated this quarter.  Mercer saw underlying revenue growth in the majority of its practices but in total was down 1%. We would expect to see more positive growth starting in the second half of the year. Nonetheless, Michele and her team were able to achieve double-digit growth in operating income, as well as margin improvement in the first quarter.  Before we move on, I'd like to give you a brief update on the Alaska lawsuit against Mercer. Since our last call, there have been a number of motions that have been filed in the litigation, and a trial is scheduled for early July in Juno. We take this matter very seriously as it represents a significant potential liability for Mercer. We cannot give any assurances regarding the ultimate outcome of the case. Since this is a pending litigation matter, we will not comment further at this time. Please refer to our public filings, including the 10-Q, which we will be filing later this week for more information on this matter. Moving on to Oliver Wyman, revenue growth was evident in the majority of its businesses. For example, Financial Services, which is Oliver Wyman's largest practice, continue to be a bright spot among industry specialties producing a double-digit percentage increase in revenue. While uncertainty remains, leading indicators across its business support our expectations that Oliver Wyman will continue to produce favorable comparisons in 2010. Now moving on to Risk Consulting and Technology, Kroll reported another quarter of improved profitability. Kroll Ontrack, its largest business, representing nearly half of its revenue, drove first quarter results with strong underlying revenue growth. As a result of substantial management actions, Kroll is re-establishing higher levels of profitability.  In summary, let me say again that we feel very good about what we've accomplished throughout MMC in the first quarter. Now let me turn it over to the Vanessa.
Vanessa Wittman: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. There are several areas I'll cover in my remarks this morning. First, I'll give an overview of MMC's consolidated earnings for the quarter. Next, I’ll discuss the results of the individual operating companies. And finally, I'll close with some observations regarding MMC's capital structure. Let's start with earnings per share. On a GAAP basis, EPS from continuing operations rose 48% from $0.33 in the first quarter of 2009 to $0.49 in this year's first quarter. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.51, an increase of 31% from $0.39 in the first quarter of 2009.  As we indicated on last quarter's earnings call, our restructuring activities have been substantially completed. Although we will continue to search for efficiencies, we expect that future activities, as reflected in our schedule of non-GAAP measures, will be focused on the refinement of our support and back-office functions as well as integration of acquisitions such as HSBC Insurance Brokers.  Additionally, I should point out that discontinued operations, net of tax in the quarter, was primarily due to the February sale of Kroll's Substance Abuse testing business. It had 2009 revenue of $37 million and a sale price of $110 million. Reflecting the de minimis effect and MMC's overall results, we have not restated prior periods for this sale.  Let's look at the results of MMC's continuing operations. Unless specifically indicated, my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses and adjusted operating income. In the first quarter, we are pleased that our strong earnings growth reflects increased operating income for not only each of our three operating segments, but every one of our five operating companies.  On a consolidated basis, MMC's operating income rose 18% compared with last year's first quarter. This is a significant increase, especially considering that higher net pension expense reduced profitability in the first quarter by $20 million. This is in line with the guidance we gave on last quarter's call.  Investment income was $8 million in the first quarter. In addition to the mark-to-market gains in our private equity portfolio, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to sell some of our direct equity investments. Looking ahead, we currently anticipate investment income of approximately $10 million in the second quarter of 2010, which should result in a positive swing in EPS of about $0.05 compared with the second quarter of 2009.  Turning back to this quarter, corporate expenses decreased 6% to $37 million in the first quarter from $39 million last year, consistent with our comments on last quarter's call that we expect corporate expenses to decline. Next, I'd like to review the performance of our operating segments, beginning with Risk & Insurance Services. On a reported basis, first quarter revenue rose 9% to $1.5 billion, and underlying revenue growth was flat. Risk and Insurance Services’ operating income rose 4% from $343 million to $357 million.  Looking at insurance broking, Marsh's first quarter revenue rose 8% on a reported basis to $1.2 billion. On an underlying basis, revenue was flat. Despite difficult industry conditions, Marsh increased revenue in many areas of the world, including U.S./Canada, Asia Pacific and Latin America. The positive momentum in new business generation Marsh achieved in the second half of 2009 continued with strong new business in the first quarter.  Marsh's operating income rose in the first quarter as the continuing focus on controlling expenses more than offset increased pension expense. At the same time, we understand the importance of reinvesting in Marsh. We are continuing to develop and improve our client technologies. Dilutions like Marsh market information, Marsh business analytics and the CS Stars Enterprise Edition are tools that help our clients make better, more data-driven decisions. Moving to reinsurance broking, Guy Carpenter continued its strong revenue performance in first quarter. On a reported basis, revenue increased 12% to $315 million, primarily due to acquisitions. Underlying growth was 1% -- a good performance considering the headwinds from continued declines in reinsurance pricing in all lines of business and increased retentions by clients. The revenue growth reflects Carpenter's strong new business production that we have seen each quarter since the third quarter of 2008.  A continued focus on cost containment kept operating expenses flat in the quarter, contributing to operating income growth. Overall, Carpenter achieved double-digit growth in operating income which includes the 2009 acquisitions of Collins and Rattner Mackenzie. We are extremely pleased with these acquisitions. Now let's turn to our Consulting segment. Reported revenue rose 7% to $1.2 billion. Underlying revenue growth was 1%. Strong expense control continued, producing a 3% decline in operating expenses in the quarter despite an increase in pension expense. These management efforts resulted in a 57% increase in operating income from $74 million to $116 million, with the operating margin for the Consulting segment increasing 320 basis points.  Mercer's reported revenue increased 6% in the first quarter to $849 million. Underlying revenue was down 1%. In the first quarter, retirement declined 5% on a year-over-year basis as we continue to see clients deferring discretionary projects.  We’re very pleased to report that Health and Benefits grew 2% in the first quarter. The major geographies that contributed to this growth were Canada, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. This growth was in spite of a decline in the U.S. due to a near-term disruption in demand as Congress debated significant legislative changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Since this legislation has been passed, we expect an increase in demands for health and benefit services which should start in the second half of this year.  Outsourcing revenue rose 3%, driven by new business in Asia Pacific and the U.S. Investment Consulting and Management increased 17%, due to very strong growth in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific. Assets under management were $30 billion.  Over the past two years, Michele and her team have done an excellent job of anticipating that economic conditions would dampen discretionary spending on the part of clients. As a result, Mercer continues to manage expenses closely. In the first quarter, even including the impact of higher pension expense, operating expenses fell 2%. Mercer achieved double-digit growth in operating income as well as margin improvement.  Oliver Wyman generated strong revenue growth in the first quarter. Reported revenue grew 10% to $306 million and underlying growth was 6%. This continues the improving fundamentals for Oliver Wyman that began to develop in the second half of 2009.  Among its industry specialties, Financial Services continued its strong performance. Reflecting the improving health of this sector, revenue rose double digits in the first quarter. Oliver Wyman is also seeing modest growth in the consumer sector and stabilization in the industrial sector. While some areas continue to experience weakness, we are very pleased that Oliver Wyman's revenue and profitability improvement in the first quarter. Let's move to Risk Consulting and Technology. Kroll had another strong quarter of improved profitability. Revenue was down 3% to $162 million on a reported basis and 2% underlying. Operating income doubled.  Since we sold Kroll Labs in mid-February, its results are included for only half of the first quarter. Given the underlying trends, the operating leverage created in 2009, and seasonality, we expect Q1 to be Kroll's lightest. Kroll's improved profitability was made possible by a turnaround in Risk Mitigation & Response as well as strong performance from Ontrack.  Kroll Ontrack, Kroll's largest business, had revenue growth of 8%. While Background Screening was down 9%, pre-employment reports, which are more of a leading indicator, increased, reflecting an encouraging sign in the U.S. and U.K. employment markets. Due to the introduction of a new income verification product, the outlook for Kroll's Mortgage [ph] Origination business is more encouraging than current market conditions might indicate.  Additionally, Ben Allen and his team continue to do an excellent job managing Kroll’s cost space with an 8% decrease in operating expenses in the first quarter. This positive leverage resulted in substantial growth in operating income and margin improvement on a year-over-year basis. We expect Kroll's growth and profitability to continue as we move forward in 2010. Turning to MMC's capital structure. Net debt was $2.4 billion at the end of the first quarter. As you know, our cash utilization is typically greatest in the first quarter, primarily due to the funding of incentive compensation payments.  Also, we used approximately $200 million of cash for acquisitions. This was primarily for HSBC Insurance Brokers. Although this deal closed on April 1, the cash was put in escrow on March 31.  Shares outstanding at the end of the first quarter were 541 million, an increase of 24 million from a year ago. The primary use of stock was 18 million shares for acquisitions, the largest of which were Collins in the second quarter of 2009 and Rutherfoord in the first quarter of 2010. 6 million shares w used for restricted stock and an employee stock purchase plan. With that, let me turn it back to Brian.
Brian Duperreault: Thank you, Vanessa. I think we can start the question period. So who has a question?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Keith Walsh with Citi.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: Two quick questions, one for Vanessa, one for Dan. I guess, Vanessa, just thinking about your EBITDA is running about $1.4 billion over the trailing four quarters, you've got dividends over $400 million and at the rate you’re doing deals, you're still accumulating cash on a go-forward basis. What are the priorities for uses of cash going forward?
Vanessa Wittman: Clearly over the last 12 to 18 months we have been very conservative with our cash. Really, the economic instability and the lack of visibility in the businesses has led us to that conclusion. And of the acquisitions done, you saw us using a lot of stock over that period. As we go forward, we will continue to make very conservative decisions as we look at acquisitions, and you saw us use cash at the very end of the first quarter for HSBC. As you noted, we're accumulating cash and we want to begin to use some of that for acquisitions but continue to balance that with other demands on the cash.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: Okay, and then for Dan, I think you said on one of the last calls we should judge you on the top line. And you certainly delivered there in the U.S., especially relative to your biggest rival, Aon. When I look at your plus one and their minus five in the Americas, maybe could give us a little color on the new business generation that you had in the quarter? And why your results and Willis’ have contrasted so much with maybe some of your other rivals?
Daniel Glaser: Well, our new business in the quarter was very strong. But our new business really throughout all of last year was good, on both a new-new and an expanded basis. If I look at this first quarter specifically, the U.S.-Canadian new business was up 14% and Internationals was up 2%, so our total was up 7%. And it was actually $221 million of new business in the quarter. So I feel very good about that. We're certainly winning in the marketplace. And ultimately, when I look at things like our RFP performance over the last few years, or 2½ years to be exact, there's been continual progress. So as I said early in this journey, I believe we are the finest insurance brokerage and risk advisory firm in the world, and now we’re executing on that.
Operator: We'll move on to Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: Dan, could you talk a little bit about contingent commissions and what successes you're having in putting in agreements? And what impact it could potentially have for revenues here going forward?
Daniel Glaser: Okay. So let me start by saying that we've been very consistent in our approach. As I've said before, we believe the broader issue relate to all carrier revenue streams and the potential conflicts of interest that they present. All brokers receive carrier compensation in one form or another, and each of these arrangements requires a good system of internal controls to manage complex and, in our opinion, complete transparency to clients. At March, we operate in many different businesses in many different parts of the world, and the compensation norms differ significantly among them. So we recognize that there’s no one-size-fits-all model for compensation. The one thing we are committed to, however, is transparency in putting the interests of our clients first. When we looked specifically at contingent commission, we made a statement a month or so ago which was that we will not accept contingent compensation or contingent commission on any placements anywhere in the world for any U.S. client served by our core U.S. brokerage operation. Now we did that not out of any concern for the propriety of contingent commissions nor any concern about our ability to manage conflicts of interest. Rather, we did it in response to discussions we had with clients, but more particularly because we can be fairly -- our belief that we can be fairly compensated in that segment without contingent compensation. So the short answer, the summary, is we will take contingent commission in certain parts of the world and in certain segments, but in our core U.S. brokerage segment we will not.
Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: And then the second question, Peter, wonder if you could you give us your thoughts on mid-year renewals and what you expect, particularly with the Chile quake and what's been going on?
Peter Zaffino: The mid-year renewals, from what we've seen so far, will behave very similar to what happened in the first quarter. Rates are still off, we saw that as we look into the second quarter. Capacity is still plentiful. While there have been an inordinate amount of catastrophes that have occurred over the last three months, none of them are going to really drive pricing in the reinsurance segment, and we can expect to see the headwinds continue throughout the year, absent any large catastrophes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the Risk & Insurance Services margin, which was down versus a year ago? I know probably a point of that or so was increased pension expense. I’m wondering if you could comment on possible FX impact in there? And I think you've suggested you would expect that to be up for the year. Is there anything that's changed in your thinking on that?
Brian Duperreault: Well, let me start and then I think Vanessa will talk about the FX. I let her do all that FX. But the margin, I think if you took the pension out, will we have it [ph] (33:39)? It was flat. We've made, in the last couple of 2½ years with Dan and Peter's work, tremendous progress on the margin. So we believe we've gotten the margins to a level that makes us kind of reasonably in the ballpark. But we know we've got to do better. And to do better we've got to grow. And the question before about Dan's growth -- I think he’s showing his growth, Peter’s certainly showing his growth. And it’s growth and it’s mix of business and we're working on both of those and that's the ultimate for us. And our margins will achieve a level appropriate for the marketplace and given what their clients are prepared to pay us. That's really the answer to the question. But Vanessa, you want to comment on the Foreign Exchange?
Vanessa Wittman: Sure. Larry, on the FX front, it was a slight positive in the quarter but fairly de minimis, and we would expect that we are reverting to our normal course of it being de minimis over the course of the year, no large impact.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: And, Brian, just a follow-up on your market commentary, on the cycle and pricing. Have you guys seen a deterioration in terms and conditions since the beginning of the year?
Brian Duperreault: A deterioration. Well, I would say it’s -- maybe Dan and Peter can comment more than I could. I'm not sure that deterioration but I think it continues to decline.
Daniel Glaser: Yes. I mean, we’re in a -- what, the seventh year of essentially a softening cycle. And from a rate standpoint in the first quarter, rates were pretty consistently down on a line-by-business basis. But maybe not in certain areas, not quite as deeply down as last year but probably more uniformly. So last year there were some pockets, such as D&O for financial institutions and mining risks, et cetera, which saw rate increases and we've actually seen some of that come off this year. And so there really is only downward pressure across virtually every line of business. But it's not a pell-mell rush to the bottom. And when we look at insurance companies’ results on a profitability basis, it's getting tighter, but still over a long period of time the results aren't bad.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: I guess the thrust of my question is that ES [ph] (36:14) price has been down for a long time. We've heard from some sources that just in the last few months terms and conditions, which had been holding up reasonably well, seem to be deteriorating at a pretty aggressive pace.
Peter Zaffino: When you talk about terms and conditions, you're usually talking about contract language and also usually deductible terms. And I would say when you look at levels of self-insured retention and deductible levels, that has over the last couple of years -- there's been downward pressure. And there's been more incentive for clients to reduce their deductibles. In terms of broadening coverage, well, that's what brokers do. We negotiate with carriers to obtain the best terms and conditions possible in the market for clients, and I would say that that's a continual process. I wouldn't say that over the last few months, we've seen any material change in the contractual terms that we negotiate for clients.
Operator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with Stifel Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Question for Michele, if I can start there. With the rewards, talent and communications’ call for organic growth, how should we think about that going forward?
M. Burns: I think you will see the rewards, talent and communications group gradually improve. What we're seeing there is a significant spike in demand in the pipeline as clients, after about taking probably as much as eight quarters all, are beginning to see places in their businesses where they really needed strategic thinking about hiring, about retention and about the shape of their workforce. So I would expect, actually globally, for us to see continued strong demand in that segment and improvement in results.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: In [ph](38:15) insurance side, I guess this is a question for Dan, how do you typically estimate the lag between economic growth and when that flows into organic growth? Just looking at that single contributing item to revenue growth in insurance brokerage?
Daniel Glaser: Well, I think the best way to look at it on a macro basis would be that insurance renewals are typically once a year, and the economy is changing every day, right? And so from that standpoint, at a maximum you have a 12-month period before that flows into the actual exposure units in an insurance policy. And certain lines of business have a little bit of a quicker view, something like Marine cargo, et cetera. As an example, in stock throughput policies you'll see month-to-month movements in premiums paid on the actual shipments. And we have begun to see some green shoots. Now what we haven't seen is to say that there has been a dramatic global turnaround and we're seeing a tremendous amount of flow. But having said that, we’re not seeing the declines we've seen before, and we have seen in some areas like marine cargo a bit more volume on shipping and a bit higher values associated with the units being shipped.
Brian Duperreault: And I think if you look, exposures get adjusted. So I think then you see last year, when the exposure adjustments -- it was double-barrel, because you had the current business reduced, and then you also had a reduction of the previous year. So when the economic turn takes place, you can see the reverse of that.
Operator: And your next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
Jay Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch: I guess it's for Dan. Dan, can you talk about the pricing on acquisitions? Is that changing at all? And what kind of competition you're seeing when it comes to buying other agencies?
Daniel Glaser: I'll take that question to be really in the agency space rather than with regard to Captives or HSBC Insurance Brokers. So in terms of the agency, I’m very satisfied with what our progress has been. I mean, right now with our acquisition which we announced yesterday of the Bostonian group, we would be the ninth-largest agent broker in the United States once you exclude the three global brokers. So I am very positive about that. Our strategy was to start by purchasing high-quality hubs, platform hubs in which to do fold-in and bolt-on acquisitions later down the road. And really, that's where our focus has been. And there’s always competition in the marketplace for these assets but we have not been in any auction environments. In fact, I don't think we would participate in that kind of environment. We’re interested in finding agencies in which we believe they have high-quality management teams, management teams that focus mainly on capabilities and driving value for clients and that fit in with Marsh's overall values and culture. Even though the agencies themselves won't be integrated within Marsh, they'll be integrated with Marsh & McLennan Agency. Marsh as an organization still stands for certain things, and we want to make sure that any acquisition that we make meets that criteria. So in terms of our hub and platform acquisitions, there are other people interested but we have not seen dramatic levels of people. I think it's fair to say that some of the players who had been active acquirers before are more on the sidelines now. In terms of multiples, I'm a buyer. I'd always prefer lower multiples. The multiples, it’s clear, are significantly lower than what existed three or four years ago. But as a buyer, I'd always want a lower multiple if we could. But they are definitely consistent with the strategy that we outline in terms of our five-year plan as to what range of multiple on EBIT we would be willing to pay for hub and platform acquisitions.
Jay Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch: Vanessa, on this share count. Other than for deals, we still have the increase in the first quarter, obviously for compensation purposes. I assume that use of shares is much more heavily weighted towards the first quarter?
Vanessa Wittman: The 18 million of shares between last year's first quarter and this year's first quarter, Jay?
Jay Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch: I was thinking more just from the fourth quarter to now. Obviously, with compensation purposes, share use, what about going forward? Does that continue, or that’s a smaller amount I’m assuming in the forward quarters?
Vanessa Wittman: You are correct on both counts. It is more heavily weighted in the first quarter and it will be smaller going forward.
Jay Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch: And then, lastly, on the private equity side, you gave us some guidance for the second quarter. Beyond that, is there a number we should think as a normalized number for private equity gains?
Vanessa Wittman: I wish there was. We report on a lag, and I think it's as much news to us as it is to you. There isn't predictability in that.
Operator: We'll take a follow-up from Meyer Shields with Stifel Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I think this is also for Vanessa. I’m looking at Page 9. You've got $274 million of MMC Consolidated results, and then there's a $10 million difference between that and the portion attributable to common shareholders. How can we model that difference going forward?
Vanessa Wittman: The discrepancy is because of the two-class method, Meyer, and I think probably from a modeling perspective if you follow up with Mike offline that's your best bet.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Thomas Mitchell with Miller Tabak.
Thomas Spikes Mitchell: With the sort of general concern and interest that should be emerging from what happened with the Deepwater Horizon, and I guess is still happening, I’m wondering if you are seeing inklings a) of some people and some businesses possibly being inclined to do a little bit less self-insurance? And also whether or not the Environmental sector is getting any significant new inquiries?
Brian Duperreault: Sounds like a question for Dan.
Daniel Glaser: Well, one, I think you have to bear in mind that the insurance marketplace is huge. And so any individual loss, other than a catastrophe loss which involves many, many insured, any loss to a single insured has a remote possibility of affecting the entire marketplace. And so I think what you would find is that there may be some upward pressure or concern in the offshore-drilling-rig marketplace. I don't even think that this loss is large enough to extend that concern to the entire energy marketplace. And in terms of size of loss, we don't have precise numbers. But in terms of the insurable amount of this loss, most prognosticators are using a number between $1 billion and $2 billion. And so even if you say it’s the upper end of that or even more than that level, it would not be enough to, in itself, impact either buying behaviors or the overall insurance marketplace.
Brian Duperreault: Well, we're going to wrap this up. And again, I want to thank you for your interest and we'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: And we'd like to thank everyone for their participation. And that does conclude today's conference.

===== 2009 Q4  (2010-02-10 08:30:00) =====
Executives:
Analysts:  Keith Walsh – Citi Brian Meredith – UBS Larry Greenberg – Langen McAlenney Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan Meyer Shields – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc. Jay Cohen – Bank of America Merrill Lynch Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital Thomas Mitchell – Miller Tabak & Co., LLC.  Welcome to MMC’s conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. Both quarter and yearend 2009 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on MMC’s website at www.MMC.com. Before we begin I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. In particular, references during this conference call to anticipated or expected results of operations for 2010 or subsequent periods are forward-looking statements and MMC’s actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. Please refer to MMC’s SEC filings which are available on the MMC website and specifically MMC’s annual report on Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2009 which will be available on the MMC website by March 1, 2010 for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today.  I will now turn this over to Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC. 
Brian Dueppereault : Thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I’m Brian Dupperreault, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me and presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. I’d also like to welcome our operating company’s CEOs to today’s call Dan Glaser of Marsh, Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter, Michele Burns of Mercer, John Drzik of Oliver Wyman and Ben Allen of Kroll. Also with us is Mike Bischoff, our President of Investor Relations. On today’s call I will discuss the progress MMC made in 2009. Then Vanessa will review our results for the fourth quarter. Afterwards we’d be happy to take your questions. Let me begin by saying that in 2009 we made great strides in strengthening Marsh & McLennan Companies as a preeminent global professional services firm. MMC’s performance in 2009 was outstanding particularly in light of the substantial economic and market challenges presented by the global recession which affected all of our operating segments. We also faced soft market conditions in the global property and casualty insurance marketplace and we were confronted with extremely low interest rates in 2009 which reduced interest income including fiduciary and corporate by nearly $120 million despite higher corporate cash levels. Lastly, the effects of foreign currency translation lowered operating income by more than $50 million which primarily affected our consulting segment.  When I joined MMC two years ago one of our major objectives was to improve both the financial performance and the margins in the risk and insurance services segment. As I said at the time, our segment margin needed to bet at a level competitive with other larger insurance brokers. Over the past two years adjusted operating income in risk and insurance services more than doubled to nearly $1 billion and the segment’s adjusted operating margin increased 1,000 basis points rising to 18.6% in 2009 from 8.6% in 2007. This was done despite the worst economic downturn since World War II. Looking just at 2009, earnings growth for risk and insurance services segment was robust. Adjusted operating income increased 35% and the adjusted operating margin rose by more than 500 basis points over 2008. This was achieved thanks to the determined efforts of thousands of dedicated colleagues around the world led by Dan and his management team at Marsh and Peter and his team at Guy Carpenter.  The main driver of MMC’s strong earnings growth was a significant improvement in profitability at Marsh. A trend that began in early 2008 when management initiated a strategy to improve operational efficiencies, strengthen financial results and deliver superior risk and insurance capabilities to clients. These excellent results at Marsh are a credit to everything Dan and his team has done over the past two years.  Marsh was able to accomplish all this while continuing to invest in the future. Including making strategic hires in client facing positions, enhancing value added technology for clients and expanding colleague training programs with an emphasis on sales. Guy Carpenter’s results in 2009 reflected the positive themes we’ve talked about for the past year, increased new business, improved client retention and a disciplined approach to expense management. Together these factors resulted in strong growth in adjusted operating income. Over the course of 2009, carpenter continued to invest in its platform enhancing its reputation as a preeminent reinsurance intermediary, recruitment of superior brokering talent and additional enhancements to their analytical capabilities have further strengthened Guy Carpenter and contributed to a strong performance in the year. New business generation was outstanding and retention returned to historically high levels. Combined, this resulted in strong underlying revenue growth of 8%, double digit growth in profitability and a solid margin improvement in 2009. Management augment and underlined growth with the successful acquisition and integration of Collins and Rattner MacKenzie.  Moving on to our consulting segment, signs at both Mercer and Oliver Wyman suggest we’ve seen the worst of the year-over-year comparisons. Both companies felt the effect of the economy in 2009 but the management teams of Mercer and Oliver Wyman responded with thoughtful cost savings initiatives. At Mercer the effects of the economic downturn were first felt in the fourth quarter of 2008. Rather than making draconian cuts across the enterprise Mercer reacted to the weakening enterprise by taking targeted measures to right size individual business lines. As a result, on a year-over-year basis Mercer was able to reduce expenses in each of the last four quarters and achieved an increase in operating margin for the second half of 2009. Over the past two years Mercer has made improvements in its operating model to capitalize on the strength of its three pillars: consulting; outsourcing; and investments. Recent initiatives included enhancing its sales organization, developing an integrated global infrastructure, streamlining the organization and making selected strategic acquisitions. In the fourth quarter revenue overall was flat but grew sequentially from the third quarter. Mercer saw signs of strength in several practices which Vanessa will cover in more detail. At Oliver Wyman, 2009 was a difficult year but signs of revenue stabilization and in some cases growth in revenue. For example, financial services which is Oliver Wyman’s largest practice and saw the earliest declines continued to be a bright spot among its industry specialties.  Leading indicators across Oliver Wyman’s businesses suggest that the stabilization and demand we saw in the latter part of 2009 should continue. Expense management actions taken early in the year enabled Oliver Wyman to grow sequential operating income and margin for the third consecutive quarter. As Oliver Wyman enters 2010 we expect it will produce favorable comparisons to 2009. Now, moving on to risk consulting and technology, Kroll is a much stronger firm than it was a year ago. Kroll Ontrack, its largest business unit representing slightly less than half its revenue, drove fourth quarter results with double digit revenue growth. Kroll’s profitability in the second half of 2009 reflected management’s aggressive actions to strengthen and refocus the company and to reduce expenses.  As a result, Kroll is reestablishing higher levels of profitability. They produced significant growth in operating income in both the third and fourth quarters compared with recent periods. Last week, we announced an agreement to sell Kroll Laboratory Specialist, Kroll’s substance abuse testing business for $110 million. We expect that transaction to close in the fourth quarter. Entering 2010 Kroll is positioned for significant growth in operating income.  Now, I’d like to briefly update you on our acquisition strategy that I discussed on last quarter’s call. Over the last three months we have announced four transactions. The largest was our agreement in December to acquire HSBC Insurance Brokers based in London. This business is a stronger complementary fit with Marsh both operationally and geographically. This transaction which is expected to close early in the second quarter will deepen Marsha’s presence in the UK, Hong Kong, Singapore, China and the Middle East.  As part of this agreement we also entered in to a strategic partnership with HSBC Bank that gives us preferred access to provide insurance brokering and risk management services to HSBC and their corporate and private clients. The remaining three announced acquisitions are part of the ramping up of our Marsh & McLennan Agency initiative. In November, we acquired Insurance Alliance, one of the largest insurance agencies in Texas. Based in Houston, Insurance Alliance has annual revenue of $15 million. In December we acquired NIA Group based in New Jersey. NIA Group has approximately 400 employees and annual revenue exceeding $60 million. In February of this year we acquired Haake Companies, based in Kansas. Haake has annual revenue of $11 million. Our strategy is to establish 10 hubs and as you can see we’re making great progress towards this objective. In summary let me reiterate that 2009 was an outstanding year for MMC. We feel good about what we’ve accomplished. As we begin 2010, we believe each of our operating companies is well positioned. Let me briefly outline some of the goals we have for the coming year. As you know 2009 expense management was the key focus for MMC and for most companies as we confronted worldwide recessionary conditions. In 2010 our primary goal is to drive top and bottom line growth across the enterprise. We plan to grow revenue organically and through strategic acquisitions. Our operating companies also need to achieve the strategic and financial goals that they’ve set for themselves. We also look to further unlock the value at MMC by better leveraging our infrastructure for additional cost savings and capitalizing on adjacencies across the operating companies to increase revenue generation and strengthen the corporation as a whole. We will continue to further reduce the risk profile of MMC through a robust enterprise risk management and compliance program. Finally, another key focus for 2010 is our employees both current and future. We will continue to focus on attraction, development and retention of professional and leadership talent with an emphasis on leadership development and diversity inclusion. So with that, let me turn it over to Vanessa.
Vanessa A. Wittman : There are four areas I’ll discuss this morning. First, I’ll give you an overview of MMC’s consolidated earnings for the quarter. Next, I’ll cover the recent settlements of securities and ERISA class action lawsuits. Then, I’ll discuss the results of the individual operating companies with a focus on the fourth quarter. Finally, I’ll close with some observations regarding MMC’s future restructuring costs, pensions and capital structure.  Let’s begin with earnings. Including the settlement of the securities law suits, EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.07 compared to $0.15 in the fourth quarter of 2008. On an adjusted basis EPS was $0.38, 6% increase from $0.36 in the prior year. As usual, in discussing our results, all my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses and adjusted operating income. In the fourth quarter MMC’s earnings growth was diversified and strong with double digit growth in the operating income of each of our three operating segments.  On a consolidated basis, MMC’s operating income rose 20% compared with last year’s fourth quarter. This is a solid performance considering one, our strong fourth quarter of 2008 when operating income rose 28% over the fourth quarter of 2007 and two, the headwinds each of our operating companies faced on only in the fourth quarter but throughout the year. Investment income was $23 million, in line with the guidance we gave you on last quarter’s call. This performance was largely due to mark-to-market increases in our private equity portfolio.  Looking ahead to the first quarter, compared with the $15 million investment loss in the first quarter of 2009 there should be an improvement of $10 to $15 million on a year-over-year basis leading to a minimal mark-to-market investment loss on the first quarter of 2010. Corporate expenses decreased 6% for 2009 to $159 million. We expect corporate expenses to decline further this year.  Now, let me discuss the recent resolution of the securities law suit. In December the US District Court approved a settlement regarding the securities class action lawsuit that was filed in 2004 related to the NYAG investigation. 96% of the eligible shares are bound by this settlement. The related ERISA class action lawsuit was also settled. MMC paid $435 million in the fourth quarter to settle these two lawsuits of which $230 million was covered by insurance.  Of the insurance recoverable we received $163 million in 2009 which was included in our yearend cash position. The remaining $67 million was received in January. The net settlement paid by MMC of $205 million is tax deductable and will contribute to a sizeable refund which we expect to receive this summer. Next, I’d like to review the performance of our operating segments beginning with risk and insurance services. Fourth quarter revenue excluding fiduciary interest decreased 1% to $1.3 billion. Risk and insurance services operating income rose 13% despite a drop in fiduciary interest income from $25 million to $12 million. The operating margin in the fourth quarter increased 110 basis points from 14.8% to 15.9%. More importantly, for the entire year the segment margin increased 530 basis points from 13.3% to 18.6%.  Looking specifically at insurance broking, Marsh’s fourth quarter revenue decreased 1% to $1.2 billion reflecting the economic environment as well as pressure on insurance premium levels, commissions and fees. Despite these difficult conditions, Marsh increased revenue in many areas of the world with more than 20 countries growing at least 5%. Additionally, new business remains strong on a global basis.  New business generation had a positive progression throughout the year. The second half of 2009 was stronger than the first half with the fourth quarter being the highest level of the year. Dan and his team continued to do an excellent job in reducing overall expenses while at the same time building a stronger, more efficient organization. The continuing focus on expense control drove Marsh’s operating expenses down 6% in the fourth quarter. This increased efficiency allowed Marsh to grow operating income more than 20% in the quarter. Moving to reinsurance brokering, Guy Carpenter continued its strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 4%, a good performance considering the difficult market conditions that include increased primary retentions as well as downward pressure on rates across many lines. For the year, Carpenter’s revenue growth was 8% led by excellent new business production which as Brian mentioned, was exceptionally strong. As we have previously discussed Carpenter’s retention rate has also returned to its historical high level contributing to the overall positive revenue performance.  Let’s turn to our consulting segment. The revenue decline of 2% was a substantial improvement from the 10% decrease in the third quarter. We believe the consulting segment has weathered the worst of the harsh economic environment. Management actions aligned expenses with revenue producing a 2% decline in operating expenses in the quarter. These efforts resulted in a 17% increase in operating income from $121 million to $142 million. This represents the segment’s highest quarterly growth rate in two years. The operating margin for the consulting segment increased 140 basis points from 10.1% in the fourth quarter of 2008 to 11.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009. As we said on our last call, we felt the third quarter for Mercer would likely represent its most difficult year-over-year revenue comparisons and this appears to have been the case.  As revenue in the fourth quarter was flat representing a substantial improvement from the third quarter. In the fourth quarter the decline in rewards, talent and communication was offset by gains in other practices. The retirement and health and benefits practices grew 2% on a year-over-year basis. Outsourcing rose 3% and investment consulting and management increased 9%. Michele and her team also did an excellent job of expense management throughout the year. The fourth quarter operating expenses decreased 2%. As a result, Mercer experienced a substantial increase in operating income exceeding 30%.  At Oliver Wyman, the rate of revenue declines has moderated over the last two quarters. Although weak economic conditions persist, we saw signs of continued stabilization in the fourth quarter. As Brian mentioned, financial services continued to be a bright spot among Oliver Wyman’s industry specialties. Revenue at financial services rose 8% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the year. The industry practice serving the retail sector was even stronger with double digit revenue growth for both the fourth quarter and the year. Other practices continued to experience weakness though most had improved performance in the fourth quarter. A strict focus on expenses resulted in Oliver Wyman achieving a sequential improvement in operating income and margin for the third consecutive quarter. In the risk consulting and technology segment, Kroll had another solid quarter particularly as it related to improved profitability. Revenue was flat year-over-year but adjusted operating income increased three fold. Kroll Ontrack, Kroll’s largest business had revenue growth of 19%, the result of continued strong performance in its litigation support related services. Additionally, Ben Allen and his team have done an excellent job reducing Kroll’s cost base with a 7% decrease in operating expenses in the fourth quarter.  This positive leverage resulted in substantial growth in operating income on a year-over-year basis. Even with the economic sensitivity in many of Kroll’s business, we expect strong growth in profitability in 2010.  Now, I would like to make a few comments about our schedule of non-GAAP measure. MMC has undergone major restructuring actions over the past several years. Marsh implemented wide spread initiatives to improve profitability during the past years and each of our other operating companies took actions to varying degrees to deal with the recession and to improve their competitive position. Looking forward, we believe future restructuring activities will be focused on the refinement of our support and back office functions as well as the integration of acquisitions.  Before I discuss our pension plans, let me make a few observations regarding pension plans generally. Defined benefit pension plans can create volatility in a company’s P&L, cash flow and balance sheet. A significant driver of this volatility is the movement of long term corporate bond rates which companies are required to use to measure pension obligations at the end of each year. With respect to our pension plans, as a result of our preliminary measurement, we are currently projecting that MMC’s pension expenses will increase in 2010 reducing operating income by approximately $80 million year-over-year. We estimate that the declines in long term corporate bond rates in the US and UK account for about two thirds of our anticipated pension expense increase in 2010. Looking beyond this year, with interest rates and borrowing spreads at relatively low levels today, it seems reasonable to assume that interest rates will increase over the next 12 to 24 months. Looking at only the impact of this one factor, any increase in interest rates will reduce our future pension expense. Regarding the funding of our pension plans, the aggregate level of contributions in 2009 approached $400 million. We currently project that contributions in 2010 should slightly exceed $300 million.  Turning to MMC’s capital structure, net debt was $1.8 billion at yearend, a reduction of $100 million from the end of 2008. The yearend figure includes the impact of funding the settlement of the securities lawsuits but as I said earlier does not include all of the insurance recoverable or the tax refund. Shares outstanding at December 31 2009 were 530 million an increase of 15.4 million shares from the end of 2008. *The remaining shares were used for employees’ stock plans. With that, let me turn it back to Brian.
Brian Dueppereault : Well, we’re ready to begin our question and answer session. Just as a reminder we have our operating companies’ CEOs also on the call available for you. With that, operator let’s start the G&A.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Keith Walsh – Citi.
Keith Walsh – Citi: I have one question for Vanessa and then one for Dan. The first question for Vanessa specifically regarding currency at Mercer, maybe you could just quantify what that impact was for the quarter? I recall last year on the call you actually gave us sort of a guidance number for the year based on movement of the dollar relative to the other currencies. If you could update us on that?
Vanessa A. Wittman : Starting with our normal position Keith is that currency overall was de minimis. Last year we gave guidance for Mercer specifically because of the anomalous movements in the currencies against each other at the beginning of the year. We gave you guidance early last year that over the first three quarters we expected the impact on Mercer alone to be between $60 and $80 million which was indeed the range of impact for the first three quarters. For the fourth quarter it turned to a slight positive and over the course of 2010, obviously we’re not predicting where the currencies move right now but we would expect it to be slightly positive impact on Mercer and the company.
Keith Walsh – Citi: If you don’t mind, can you just quantify what that impact in the quarter was for Mercer?
Vanessa A. Wittman : We’re not going to quantify it.
Keith Walsh – Citi: Then for Dan, I think all of us on the line understand pricing and the impact on your revenues but maybe if you could talk a little bit about the leverage of the economies that your business has because I think that’s something maybe that we don’t understand quite as well.
Daniel S. Glaser : I think the economic impact is the single biggest factor. I think it’s much broader than the insurance cycle. The insurance cycle over my career, over 30 years, most of it has been soft and so I think that Marsh can improve in any sort of insurance cycle and that has less of an impact. The economic results are very considerable and you see them in a lot of different ways. One, there’s a cost consciousness in our client base that we have not experienced before.  I think that in a lot of the large account space worldwide you see a significant involvement of procurement rather than risk managers determining buying decisions. We see a lot of conservatism and caution around project work and certainly project work with regard to areas where we have defect expertise, enterprise risk management, corporate governance, supply chain, those areas I would say are viewed as more discretionary at least in the short term. We expect some level of bounce back on them in 2010. The other impact the economy has is exposure units. I travel around the world meeting with clients and I’ve met with certain clients who have literally told me that their performance is down 70% and levels like that. So from that standpoint while there might be a rate reduction of 5% or 7% it’s being applied against an exposure unit which might be down 25%, or 30%, or 40% and that has significant impact on us.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Brian Meredith – UBS.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Two questions, first in the risk services business, can you describe kind of what the current kind of competitive environment is with respect to broker compensation going on right now?
Daniel S. Glaser : It’s always a competitive environment with regard to broker compensation. I feel very good about where we are at Marsh in terms of how we compensate our people and the clarity around rewards. I’ve always believed, as a side note, that compensation is only one factor in terms of colleague satisfaction. A lot has to do with the impact and influence that they have over the decision making in the company, etc.  So we’re believers in as much decentralized decision making as possible and empowering people to do the jobs and do what’s right for the client. Our mantra internally is if it meets our values as a company and if it’s good for your client, it’s virtually always the right course of action. I think that makes people feel good about working at Marsh. Our variable compensation that we pay as a proportion of overall comp and also just as an absolute number have both increased significantly over the last 24 months as our profitability has improved. We are in a much strong position now to compete for talent on a comp basis and the people who work at Marsh, it’s own pay packets have been improving along with our profitability improvements.
Brian Meredith – UBS: That was a great answer but I was also talking about as far as broker compensation and commission rates and fees.
Daniel S. Glaser : In terms of broker comp in general we haven’t been sitting on our hands over the past couple of years, we have been negotiating one with clients and also with carriers. On the client front we have made a lot of progress on pricing of services and where we were getting small increases generally across the portfolio in our fee based client. Now, the wind gets taken out of our sales every once in a while when we’re in competition in an RFP particularly a defensive RFP because there may be price pressure on an existing fee. So we’re getting increases in some parts of our portfolio but we have down drafts in other so we end up about the same. With regard to our commissions portfolio we have been negotiating higher levels of commission and enhanced commission based upon services we provide to carriers and we’ve been doing that on a worldwide basis and that is one of the contributors to our financial performance.
Peter Zaffino : We still see it being very competitive on compensation with our competitors. More of our clients are asking for justification in terms of what we earn relatively to value and that’s why we’ve positioned ourselves over the past 12 to 24 months of continue to invest in our analytical capabilities and the value added services that we can provide because just receiving brokerage for reinsurance placement will not be enough in today’s competitive environment and the additional services that Guy Carpenter provides we believe position ourselves to receive the appropriate renumeration in the industry. So it’s shifted a lot more justification as to how and why you get paid what you’ve been paid historically and feel we’re well positioned to continue to grow that way.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Then can I ask a question on Mercer just quickly for Michele? The Alaska law suit is getting a lot of press recently. Not so much on what’s going on there but is it having any impact on your business as far as companies getting clients at all?
Michele Burns : We have not seen any impact. We had a great quarter with revenue generation across all units. One of the things that is interesting about what happened this quarter is we saw literally every one of our lines a sequential improvement in terms of revenue generation so we don’t see any significant impact from Alaska on our business.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Larry Greenberg – Langen McAlenney.
Larry Greenberg – Langen McAlenney: I was just wondering if you can give us some color on the allocation of the increased pension costs by segment?
Vanessa A. Wittman : Larry, think of it as roughly two thirds for risk and insurance services. 
Larry Greenberg – Langen McAlenney: Is there any color you could provide on the Alaska law suit?
Brian Dueppereault : First of all we appreciate the question and I guess I can understand your interest and others interest in the matter and I would refer you to our public filings to start with. But having said that, broadly speaking the civil suit regarding Mercer, first that Mercer underestimated future healthcare costs for two of the Alaska pension plans and two that Mercer failed to disclose a data entry to the client back in 2002 and 2003.  On the first point, Mercer believes its estimate of future healthcare costs were reasonable and in line with the projections made at the time by competitors and other actuaries nationally. On the second point, Mercer has acknowledged that there was a data entry error that wasn’t disclosed to the client in those two years but Mercer believes the error had no impact on the actual funding of the plans. That is important, in ’02 and ’03, Mercer advised the plans to substantially increase their contribution rates and the plans did not adopt Mercer’s calculations. Mercer believes it has substantial defenses to these claims and we’ll continue to defend ourselves. The trial is in July in Juno. We take it very seriously but I hope you can understand this is a pending litigation matter and so I really can’t comment any more on it.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan. 
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan: A couple of questions, first on the comment that one thing that could help margins next year is the integration of acquisitions. Can you give us a little insight in to what the margin structure might look like for some of those businesses kind of before and after?
Brian Dueppereault : The ones that we’re referring to are primarily in the Marsh McLennan Agency, that initiative. I guess I could but Dan will do it.
Daniel S. Glaser : A couple of things, as we described our Marsh McLennan Agency strategy, a big part of that was we wanted to expand our business in the middle market, in the small account space, in some specialty areas and even in areas like employee benefits and personal lines. Those businesses generally, and the agencies that we have acquired generally have margins which are superior to Marsh’s existing US margin and so over time as we build that strategy we will get margin lift in the US and overall within the segment as well. It’s going to take some time because we’ve got a very big base of revenue and these acquisitions are relatively small. But, this is our strategy and we’re committed to it. I would think that what you would see is you won’t see much over the next couple of years because of the size of the acquisitions relative to the base but I think by about year three you’ll start to see lift.
Brian Dueppereault : You’ll see a cumulative effect as each one adds to the other.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan: With your platform, those come with higher margins than you consolidated business now but are you given your infrastructure is it fair to assume that you’re effectively able to eliminate a significant portion of their fixed cost structure?
Brian Dueppereault : One, we’re not integrating Marsh McLennan Agency with Marsh, Inc. So we’re running the agency business as a separate standalone business. So what you’ll find is the agency will be integrated with March McLennan Agency, the overall structure of March McLennan Agency and there will be savings but it’s not the savings that are generating the benefit for us so you wouldn’t see dramatic levels.  I think where you see the benefit of margin improvement is in those agencies where we’re establishing hubs we will also do fold in and bolt on acquisitions to that which will be much smaller operations and which we would rely on the hub location to provide all the finance, HR< legal, compliance back office capabilities and those would be highly margin accretive.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan: Then just a follow up on Kroll, can you talk about some of the trends driving the increase usage of your litigation services?
Ben Allen : A couple of things, one is we use a bill back early in the year. I think I mentioned this on our last call as well, you saw consistent with economic decisions some cautious behavior around litigation so while I don’t think the volume will have changed much, the behavior has changed so people were settling quicker, people were delaying activity and lawsuits which impacts our revenue but you can’t do that forever in litigation. So what we saw is the activity levels having to progress on these matters and return to normal levels. That and some of the good work that the Kroll Ontrack division did also contributed to it in terms of pricing and offerings. So we’re seeing a return back to what it’s normally been.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan: But we shouldn’t think about there as being a pipeline that needs to effectively unwind?
Ben Allen : No.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan: Can you just give us the revenue associated with the substance business you’re selling?
Ben Allen : For 2009 it was between $35 and $40 million.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Meyer Shields – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.
Meyer Shields – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: I was hoping to get Peter to talk a little bit about how much the 2009 increases in property catastrophe reinsurance rates impact had on you because I think that’s one of the few areas where we’re seeing rates actually get worse in 2010.
Peter Zaffino : It was an impact on what? You cut out on us.
Meyer Shields – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: On revenues on reinsurance?
Peter Zaffino : Well, a year ago when we looked at first quarter of 2009 we started to see some lift in property catastrophe rates and we’re not seeing that as we look in to 2010. With January first property CAT we saw a worldwide increased around a decreased 6%. But when we capture that information throughout the entire calendar year we look at rate and restructure of programs along with any retention increases and we did not have a positive quarter this year from rate and from restructure of programs. So in quarter one, two, three and four that was all negative to our beginning or held portfolio and so our new businesses is what outpaced that. So while we did see some rate increase in the early part on property CAT the overall impact on our portfolio for the calendar year was negative. 
Meyer Shields – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: I guess this is a question for Dan, can you give us any ballpark estimate of the difference in commission rates between legacy Marsh business and the companies you’re acquiring in Agency?
Daniel S. Glaser : It’s a great question actually and I think there’s variability agency by agency. I sort of look at it as Marsha as an organization wins either way. On the one hand, if we are acquiring an agency and they have a commission standard rate structure which is higher than Marsh with markets with which Marsh overall in the US does a great deal more business. You can imagine our negotiating stance with those markets about lifting Marsh to the level that they’re paying the agent and if the converse is true and we acquire an agency in which Marsh’s commission structure is higher than the agent, then we would immediate go and negotiate with carriers to lift that agency to Marsh’s overall level.  So really we win either way. But I would say that it varies agent-by-agent. In the first few that we have done and bear in mind we have looked at a lot of agencies. We have done three transactions but we have looked at structures of a lot of agencies. On the first three that we’ve done there’s been tremendous similarities between the Marsh standard rates and the agency standard rates. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jay Cohen – Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay Cohen – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Two questions, I guess first for Peter, can you talk about the trend of increasing retention among seating clients. Is that continuing in to 2010?
Peter Zaffino : Yes it is, when we saw such a strengthening of balance sheet both on the primary and reinsurance side that taking either large co participations or increasing net retentions was the trend we saw in the fourth quarter and it’s a trend we saw for January 1 as well so I would anticipate that will continue in 2010.
Jay Cohen – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Then second question, more of a numbers question, as you talk about the adjustments to earnings, within risk and insurance services there was this $21 million of settlement, legal and regulatory and then the foot note it said, “These costs were offset by a credit of $34 million related to insurance recoveries of previous legal expenses.” I’m wondering is it $21 net of the $34?
Vanessa A. Wittman : Yes it is.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: You were able to give us an outlook directionally on some of the major businesses. I was hoping you could talk about risk insurance services in more detail in terms of organic growth and margins for 2010?
Brian Dueppereault : I’d say that organically flat to modestly up. It’s kind of hard to project more than that with the economy coming out of its worst but not necessarily being robust itself and then of course the insurance market. But, we still think we can do flat to modestly up across the segment. When you look at the insurance business I think it tends to have the cyclicality that the consulting business doesn’t have. It’s more steady than the consulting business is. We have to rise and fall with the market and so our strategy has been to grow both by acquisition and organically and so our emphasis is absolutely to get organic growth.  We’re going to grow and we’re going to grow both ways and we have an emphasis on acquisitions, particularly the Marsh McLennan Agency. I outlined four things that we did in the brokering business, we even did a couple in the reinsurance and we’re going to look for more and more opportunities to grow through acquisition particularly in this market.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: On the margin profile, if RIS was 18.6 in 2009 adjusted where do you see that heading in 2010?
Brian Dueppereault : I made an exception and gave you guidance on margins but it was an exception so I don’t want to continue that. But, let me say it this way, 2010 would be you have to consider it a difficult year for margins. We talked about growth, to me margin is one measure and profit is another and we intend to grow the company top and bottom line particularly in this segment. I hope that helps.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Thomas Mitchell – Miller Tabak & Co., LLC.
Thomas Mitchell – Miller Tabak & Co., LLC.: If you look at your overall mix of business in insurance brokerage and risk services, could you give us just a general idea of how much of that is earned in Euros and how much of that is earned in British Pounds? Not earnings revenues.
Brian Dueppereault : I don’t know, do we break that out? I’m not sure we do. We do give you regional information for – let me put it this way, we give you regional information and in Europe the UK is the largest operation we have so it would be probably weighted to the UK pound than to Euro. I think that’s about the best that I can do.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan: Could you just give us the pension amortization expense in the fourth quarter?
Brian Dueppereault : Vanessa do we have that?
Vanessa A. Wittman : No, we don’t.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan: Is it fair to assume just for modeling purposes that it’s probably not too inconsistent with the prior quarters?
Vanessa A. Wittman : That’s correct. Really, the way that we disclose it on our K is on a forward-looking basis and we said for ’09 that it was the roughly as ’08 and as you’ll see in the K and we talked about in the call, there will be an incremental increase for 2010 over 2009 and you can just put that ratably over the quarters.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Keith Walsh – Citi.
Keith Walsh – Citi: Two questions, one for Peter just on the reinsurance side, can you quantify how much of the 2009 organic growth was attributed to the large [charters] renewal?
Peter Zaffino : We don’t break out specific client revenue but overall it was a de minimis impact from our large five clients who have remained fairly flat year-over-year if you look at the full calendar for 2009.
Keith Walsh – Citi: Then just on Mercer, maybe if you could talk just briefly on what the strategic need to keep the executive comp business for example, we’ve seen recently one of your competitors is going to exit that with the current scrutiny. Then also, talk about the public pension and public health clientele, again one of your competitors exited that business several years ago. Why deal with these states if they’re going to be a potential litigation risk?
Michele Burns : Let’s take the second one first, on the public business we do intend to stay in that business, we think we provide a good service to those clients. That said, we will not be staying in that business as long as limits of liability are not agreed to and the relationship with the client isn’t better defined. So we are taking a strong look at that and looking across or client base. But there are good services provided to good people in that business and we don’t want to just exit it.  Similarly executive comp, we’ve taken a similar step to what you’ve read about from our competitors. We have divested or spun off if you will a piece of our executive comp business and specifically a piece that desired to work specifically [boards]. We believe that being in the executive compensation business is an important service for Mercer across all the different services that we provide. Many of our clients desire for us to be in there to help management for example because management needs executive compensation and renumeration advice.  Some boards also desire to have the same consulting and where they are clear with the conflicts and we are clear with how we represent and disclose ourselves, we feel it is an appropriate service for us to offer. So generally we think in both those situations we have good services to offer but they need to be properly structured, properly disclosed and properly protected.
Operator:  Your final question comes from Meyer Shields – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.
Meyer Shields – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Just really quickly I was hoping you could give us some indication for modeling purposes of the mix of stock and cash you use for acquisitions?
Vanessa A. Wittman : We maintained our flexibility through 2009 to be able to use – we filed the shelf and we used both stock and currency. We don’t really have a guideline. We access each acquisition individually and we’re not going to give guidance on whether we’re using stock or cash for the acquisitions.
Brian Dueppereault : We want them all to be accretive and sometimes cash is the appropriate way to go, sometimes they have to be constructed in a stock offering for the idiosyncrasies of that particular company. We’re cognoscente of it, we have maintained our cash as we should have in difficult times. Now we have it, we would use it appropriately. Thank you everybody. Let me just close by first of all thanks for the interest, I’d like to thank my colleagues for a great year and all the employees who are listening. Thanks to you too. We’ll talk to you next quarter. Thank you very much.
Operator:  That does conclude our conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day everyone. Welcome to today's MMC's conference call. Today's call is being recorded. Third quarter 2009 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on MMC's website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results which are forward-looking statements as the term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. In particular, references during this conference call to anticipated or expected results of operations for 2009 or subsequent periods are forward-looking statements and MMC's actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. Please refer to MMC's most recent SEC filings as well as the company's earnings release which are available on the MMC website for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn this call over to Mr. Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC.
Brian Duperreault: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I am Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me in presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman our CFO. I'd also like to welcome our operation company CEOs to today's call, Dan Glaser of Marsh, Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter, Michele Burns of Mercer, Ben Allen of Kroll; John Drzik of Oliver Wyman is joining us by phone from Dubai. Also with us is Mike Bischoff our Head of Investor Relations. I'll make some brief comments on the quarter overall before turning it over to Vanessa to provide additional information regarding our financial results. Then we'd be happy to take your questions. Let me begin by saying how pleased I am to report that MMC's third quarter earnings performance was very strong. To give you some context, when I joined MMC in January 2008, we faced two significant challenges. First we needed to correct the inner workings of Marsh to enable the business to once again operate at peak performance. And second, we needed to improve the financial performance in the overall Risk and Insurance Services segment which includes both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. In particular, we needed to boost our segment margin to a level competitive with other large insurance brokers. Well, Dan and his team have made tremendous drives at Marsh, and Peter and his team have significantly strengthened Carpenter. The main drive of our strong earnings growth in the quarter was another significant improvement in profitability at Marsh, a trend that began in early 2008. In the third quarter, senior management continued to execute a re-engineering of Marsh that has resulted in tremendous operational efficiencies, strong new business and improved colleague morale. The improvement in Marsh's operating results, with a strong contribution from Carpenter, should allow us to reach our adjusted operating margin target for Risk and Insurance Services of 18%. In fact, over the past four quarters, the Risk and Insurance Services margin was 18.4%. That represents an increase of more than 1,000 basis points from the end of 2007 or a little less than two years. This is tremendous progress. It's even more impressive when you consider the current operating environment, which includes lower short-term interest rates that have substantially reduced fiduciary interest income. So it's clear that we've been successful in achieving two important objectives we set for ourselves in January of 2008. These excellent results at Marsh are a testament to everything Dan and the Marsh team have done over the past two years to improve financial results. At the same time, they have dramatically improved the capabilities of Marsh in ways large and small that serve the client better. Like any global firm in the process of transformative change, Marsh will continue to face challenges but their performance thus far has proven that this team has the ability to manage effectively in very difficult conditions. Guy Carpenter's results in the third quarter continue to reflect the positive themes we've talked about for the past year, increased new business, improved client retention and a disciplined approach to expense management. Together this resulted in an increase in operating income that made a strong contribution to MMC's year-over-year growth. At the same time, and just as importantly, Peter had been working to remake Guy Carpenter into a firm widely regarded by the industry as the preeminent insurance intermediary. As part of that effort, Carpenter made several significant additions to its senior management team this year, further enhancing the depth and breadth of Carpenter's research platform and capabilities. First Richard Booth joined as Vice Chairman in July. Richard has more than 30 years of experience in senior roles, most recently at AIG and Hartford Steam Boiler. His deep knowledge and insurance industry expertise are helping set the overall strategic direction of Guy Carpenter. He is also advising on ways to further improve operational performance. Also in July we made a second key addition to senior management, another industry veteran I've known for years. Chris McKeown was named CEO of Carpenter's Global Analytical and Specialty Practices. Chris was most recently president and CEO of CIG Reinsurance Limited and New Castle Reinsurance Company. Previously, he was CEO of ACE Tempest Reinsurance Company Limited in Bermuda. At Carpenter, Chris will play a critical role as we expand and enhance our global analytical and advisory functions to generate even greater value for clients. In August we also welcomed Henry Keeling as President and CEO of International Operations. I've also known Henry for many years, and Peter and I both feel very fortunate to be able to add someone of his caliber to Carpenter's management team. Henry began his career in London and was both an underwriter and a broker for nearly 20 years before moving to Bermuda in 1993. There he held senior positions at Mid Ocean and XL Capital. In his new role, Henry is responsible for Carpenter's operations in the U.K., continental Europe, Asia-Pacific, Australia and Bermuda. This is just a sampling of how Carpenter recently has strengthened its human capital which should enhance its revenue growth. Moving on to our consulting segment, both Mercer and Oliver Wyman continued to face difficult conditions in the third quarter. However, we are seeing signs that the worst of the year-over-year revenue comparisons are behind both companies. At Mercer, management's close eye on expenses allowed the company to keep its adjusted operating margin in line with the past several years. Even while navigating difficult headwinds, Michele and her team have focused on retaining capabilities in terms of people and offerings. Additionally, Mercer continued to invest in its business throughout the year improving core infrastructure, transforming certain of its businesses and developing greenfield offerings. Oliver Wyman is seeing signs of revenue stabilization in most areas and so our year-over-year growth in the quarter in financial services, its largest businesses. Expense management also enabled Oliver Wyman to grow sequential operating income and margin for the second quarter in a row. At Kroll we saw a solid quarter. Despite year-over-year revenue declines, the result of challenging markets, Kroll was able to improve profitability primarily due to expense discipline and modest revenue growth at Ontrack, its largest business unit. We're also seeing evidence of revenue stabilization in many of Kroll's other lines of business. Kroll produced significant growth in operating income in the third quarter compared with recent periods. Now, let me spend a few minutes updating you on our acquisition strategy. Another goal I had when I joined MMC was to grow the company through acquisitions when appropriate opportunities presented themselves. It was important, however, that we do deals only when we're ready to take them on. By the beginning of 2009 we felt we had successfully positioned MMC so as to be able to consider acquisitions to further enhance the capabilities of our five operating companies. In January we acquired the remaining stake, 49% of DeLima Marsh in Colombia allowing Marsh, Guy Carpenter and Mercer to continue expanding business in that country. In April Carpenter acquired Collins, formerly the fifth largest reinsurance intermediary in the United States and the seventh largest in the world. The integration of Collins is proceeding extremely well and further strengthens Carpenter's specialty capabilities and diversifies its position in North America. In September, Marsh announced the acquisition of International Advisory Services, the largest independent manager of captive and third party insurance companies in Bermuda. By adding IAS, Marsh has solidified its position as a global leader in managing captive insurance companies. In October, Guy Carpenter acquired Rattner Mackenzie Limited, a specialty reinsurance broker. This deal is consistent with Carpenter's strategy to supplement organic growth with targeted acquisitions.  Finally, I'd like to discuss Marsh & McLennan Agency. As you'll remember, we announced a year ago that we would launch a new U.S. initiative in Marsh dedicated to serving the insurance needs of middle market clients below national brokerage accounts. The agency took a major step forward in January when David Eslick was named CEO. I'm sure most of you know Dave was most recently CEO of USI. Over the course of 2009, Dave and his team have built a pipeline of potential acquisition candidates. That we've gone this long with announcing any deals speaks to the measured approach we've taken to build Marsh & McLennan Agency. We have moved deliberately to be sure we are prudent in our approach to acquisitions and that each firm we identify meets our requirements with respect to quality, cultural compatibility, consistent business approach and, lastly, pricing. As we approach year-end, we are likely to announce several acquisitions which will allow Marsh & McLennan Agency to operate in select geographic areas across the United States. This approach will adopt a hub and spoke system to provide commercial property casualty, directors' and officers' liability, surety, employee benefits and personal line products that customers at the local level through a dedicated sales and service force. So our approach to acquisition is thoughtful and appropriate use of capital and another way in which MMC can create long-term value for our shareholders.  In summary, let me say that we really feel very good about the enormous strides we've made at MMC, most recently illustrated by third quarter results and we remain excited about MMC's long-term prospects. Now let me turn it over to Vanessa.
Vanessa Wittman: In the third quarter, MMC's earnings were very strong. EPS from continuing operations rose from $0.03 in the third quarter of 2008 to $0.40 in the current quarter, and adjusted EPS more than doubled from $0.20 to $0.48. Both GAAP and adjusted EPS in the third quarter include a net tax benefit primarily related to the resolution of tax matters from prior periods totaling $0.18 per share. If you exclude this tax benefit and focus on our core operating performance, adjusted EPS in the third quarter was $0.30, an increase of 50% from last year's $0.20. Investment income increased to $21 million, in line with the guidance we gave you on last quarter's call. This performance was primarily due to increases in our private equity portfolio. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate that investment income will be close to the $19 million we reported in last year's fourth quarter. Now I'd like to review the performance of our operating segment. All references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses and adjusted operating income. Beginning with Risk and Insurance Services, revenue excluding fiduciary interest income decreased 1% to $1.2 billion.  Although we are in an environment where revenue growth is hard to find, within Marsh we saw increased brokerage revenue in many places with strong growth in our Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions. Guy Carpenter also reported continued growth in revenues with 6% growth in the quarter.  More importantly, Risk and Insurance Services had strong growth in operating income in spite of a $24 million reduction in fiduciary interest income. Even including the decrease in fiduciary interest income, operating income more than doubled, increasing from $69 million to $158 million. This was the major driver of MMC's strong earnings performance in the quarter. Both Marsh and Guy Carpenter contributed to this increase, although the predominance of the increase was produced by Marsh. Compared with the first nine months of last year, the operating margin at Risk and Insurance Services increased more than 600 basis points, rising from 12.9% to 19.6%. We are extremely pleased with the outstanding growth in profitability and margins produced by Risk and Insurance Services over the first nine months of the year. The operating income growth we expect Risk and Insurance Services to produce in the fourth quarter will not be to the same degree as the previous quarters. First, we continue to operate in an environment where revenue growth remains extremely difficult to achieve. Second, Guy Carpenter historically operates at essentially breakeven in the fourth quarter. And finally, the year-over-year margin improvement of the segment will moderate as we lap major expense reduction initiatives from last year. Now looking specifically at Marsh. Third quarter revenue decreased 2% excluding fiduciary interest income to just under $1 billion. This decline reflects the continuing challenging economic environment in many parts of the world as well as the overall pressure on insurance premium levels, commissions and fees. Our revenue retention rate remained stable and new business generation remained strong. Marsh's new business in the third quarter was at its highest level of the year. Additionally, new business as a percent of current client revenue remains strong throughout the world.  Prudent expense control drove Marsh's operating expenses down 11% in the third quarter, resulting in substantial growth in operating income. Dan and his team have done an excellent job, not just this quarter but over the past two years in reducing overall expenses while building a stronger, more efficient organization. And Marsh was able to accomplish all of this while continuing to invest for the future. We've invested in our front line capabilities, training programs for our colleagues and value-added technology. We've also continued to increase the levels of variable compensation and response to better operating performance. While Marsh will continue to enhance the efficiency of its operations, its formal restructuring plans should be substantially completed by the end of this year.  Moving to reinsurance broking, Guy Carpenter continued its strong revenue performance this quarter. Its continued year-over-year growth in new business in the third quarter was impressive considering the very strong level of new business production in last year's third quarter. And Carpenter's retention rate showed improvement on a year-over-year basis for the third consecutive quarter. Over the course of the year, Carpenter's retention rate has increased, returning to historically high levels. While Carpenter has been growing revenue, there also has been an ongoing focus on expense management. Year-to-date expenses were down 2%, a credit to Peter and his team especially given the investments Carpenter has made for growth. Any way you look at it, Guy Carpenter delivered superb performance this quarter. Now let's turn to our consulting segment which continued to face challenging economic conditions in the third quarter. Consulting revenue declined 10% including 8% at Mercer and 14% at Oliver Wyman. Looking first at Mercer, revenue in the third quarter decreased due to several factors including a reduction in discretionary consulting assignments and a decrease in payroll levels that affected health and benefits and outsourcing. For the first three quarters, revenue at its two largest practices, retirement and health and benefits, held up reasonably well, each decreasing by only 2%. Outsourcing declined 9% and investment consulting and management increased 5%. We believe the third quarter will be Mercer's most difficult year-over-year revenue comparison. With thoughtful planning in advance of the economic downturn, Mercer has been able to reduce expenses in each quarter of 2009 on a year-over-year basis. In the third quarter, expenses decreased 8%, matching the decline in revenue. Because Michele and her team have done an excellent job of pulling the levers of expense management in this difficult operating environment, Mercer was able to hold its operating margin in the quarter in line with the past several years in spite of the headwinds from the effects of foreign currency translation. For the nine months of 2009, the reduction of Mercer's operating income from foreign exchange was $54 million including $9 million this quarter. Given where the dollar is today, it's reasonable to assume that foreign exchange may be a slight benefit to operating income in the fourth quarter as opposed to the headwind that Mercer has faced over the past year. Oliver Wyman's third quarter revenue decline was an improvement from the first half of 2009. Although weak economic conditions continue, we are seeing signs of stabilization in many part of its business. Financial Services, which is Oliver Wyman's largest practice, and saw the earliest declines, grew in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. However, some practices saw continued weakness, particularly those serving the automotive and other industrial sectors. In aggregate, the leading indicators across this business portfolio suggest the stabilization in demand, seen by Oliver Wyman in the third quarter, should continue into the fourth quarter.  Oliver Wyman continues to target expense management as a high priority, which is evidenced by a 14% reduction in third quarter operating expenses. This strict focus on expenses resulted in Oliver Wyman achieving a sequential improvement in operating income and margin for the second consecutive quarter. And as conditions gradually improve, Oliver Wyman can react quickly to recovering client demand by expanding capacity, which had been reduced over the course of this year to manage expenses.  For example, management is now reducing its use of temporary leave of absence programs and bringing forward employment start dates that have been previously pushed off into 2010. So overall, if economic conditions continue on their current course, Oliver Wyman is well positioned for future growth.  Now, let me move to risk consulting and technology. At Kroll, signs of stabilization are also evident. Revenue was $170 million, a decline of 9%. On track, Kroll's largest business had revenue growth of 1%, its best performance in the past four quarters. And we saw a revenue stabilization on a sequential basis for Kroll's other two business units, risk mitigation and response and background screening. Overall, revenue increased 6% sequentially.  Additionally, Kroll has done an excellent job controlling expenses, with a decrease of 10% for both the third quarter and year-to-date. And although operating income was down slightly on a year-over-year basis, Kroll produced a substantial increase, compared with its operating income in the past three quarters. Please remember that the fourth quarter is Kroll's lightest period, due to seasonality in some of its businesses, so we do not expect its operating income to match the level of the third quarter.  Now, turning to MMCs capital structure, our balance sheet remains strong. Net debt decreased $500 million from the end of the second quarter to $1.8 billion at September 30th. MMC has no outstanding commercial paper or bank loans, and we recently closed a new, $1 billion, multi currency, three-year revolving credit facility that replaced our previous $1.2 billion revolver.  With that, let me turn it back to Brian. 
Brian Duperreault:  I'd like to begin our question and answer session, and as a reminder, our operating companies' CEOs are also available to answer your questions. So operator, Vicky, let's start. 
Operator:   (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from Keith Walsh – Citi. 
Keith Walsh – Citi:  First question, if I could just get Dan as well as Peter, to comment on it, just thinking about future margin gains, year-to-date, you guys at 19.6, have matched your biggest rival who have doing this for several more years than you, as far as the turnaround is concerned. Thinking about a difficult 2010 revenue environment, can you talk specifically about what levers, both in Guy Carpenter, as well as within Marsh retail, are left to drive earnings and margins as we go forward? 
Dan Glaser: Well, let's talk about Q4 and then talk a little bit about beyond. Clearly we're beginning to lap some of the major initiatives that we've done over the last couple of years. I still expect to see margin improvement in Q4. I also expect to see margin improvement within Marsh next year, but not at the same pace that we have been going at over the last couple of years.  The Marsh story is in not an expense story. It's a turnaround story. We have focused on expenses over the past couple of years and I'm really thrilled with my management team to, over the last few months, be able to turn all of our energy to how do we grow this business, both organically and by acquisition. So I think over the course of the next several years, you will see levels of growth both by acquisition and organic.  While we have been focused on improving the margin and reducing expense, don't get the wrong impression that even though a lot of that has dropped to the bottom line we haven't been investing in the business. We've been actively investing in the business. Just to give you a couple of things, in this people business, we hired 300 sales professionals this year around the world and year-to-date. So actually, since early 2008, we've hired 186 managing directors and senior vice presidents, all focused on ways to grow the business. 
Peter Zaffino: Echo what Dan said at the beginning; a lot of our expense initiatives have been lapped as you look at 2009 and as we look forward to 2010, but the Guy Carpenter story is about top line growth. We've made, as Brian said in his opening comments, significant investments in senior executives, but a focus on top line growth, which we've been able to achieve.  If you look at the third quarter we had strong new business, but that's on top of having a strong new business for the third quarter in 2008. We believe there's excellent opportunities for expansion in our portfolio in the international segment, in addition to repositioning our analytical and advisory services, so we will be focusing heavily on top line growth while managing expenses to maximize margins. 
Keith Walsh – Citi: Dan, just to follow up specifically on your answer, you know, I appreciate you said you think you can grow next year, as far as the margin is concerned, but what are the specific levers, besides headcount reduction, if you can just maybe point to a couple? It seems like you've had some very, very strong upside to the margin. I'm just not certain in a down revenue environment or flat how you can continue to even get any gains at all? If you can just answer that, thanks. 
Dan Glaser: A couple of things, one, in a down revenue environment, it's always more difficult right obviously, and so when I look through our strategic plans and our budget process, we look across the spectrum of growing the business to declining the business and what kind of contingencies we would be able to exercise across that spectrum in order to deliver more value and more margin to shareholders.  When I'm looking at going into next year, I am considering the investments that we've made this year and I expect some delivery of an improvement. One thing to bear in mind, I mean, the economic impact of – it's pretty tremendous, but where there's growth we're capturing that level of growth. So I mean just to give you an idea, in the quarter, greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, grew 13%. We grew 28% in the Middle East. Argentina, we grew 20%, Brazil 10%, India 17%. So on the ground where there is growth around the world, we're capturing it.  And so I do think that we're well positioned. I expect the large-scale restructuring efforts are drawing to a close and that, I feel, is very good news for Marsh and it allows us to really focus on growing the business. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Brian Meredith – UBS. 
Brian Meredith – UBS: A couple of questions here, the first one, can I ask how successful have any of you been at monetizing on the placement hub so far, as far as getting additional commission? 
Dan Glaser: Well one, our placement hubs are doing very well, and in fact in the quarter, we've done over 90% or the U.S. business has flowed through hubs. So they're working very well and as you recall, the hubs do a lot of different things for us. One, first and foremost, for clients, it enables us to negotiate better terms and conditions and have a much better crack at contract certainty and s, from that perspective that was a main driver of organizing the hubs.  I also think because reducing the level of variability, in terms of placement activities and focusing our placement activities in more limited places with people who do placement day in and day out, will reduce our E&O exposure over time. And obviously the hubs, in our view, create a lot of value for carriers. I mean, at the end carriers will be more efficient and it will reduce carrier costs, in addition to increasing the competition that I mentioned before.  And so, our system, Marsh Market Connect, is designed to help underwriters target business, increase their quote-to-submission ratios and [buy-in]-to-quote ratios and make them more competitive. And so in my view it's very fair that we seek to monetize some of that value creation.  I don't intend to disclose specific numbers as we go forward on that because I think that's really between us and carriers and it's variable, but I would say you know in terms of agreements that we have we have more than 30 agreements with carriers with regard to additional compensation related to our placement hub. So over time I would expect to be a good contributor to our bottom line.
Brian Meredith – UBS:  Quick follow-up, can I get you also to comment on your views on the market conditions, commercialized pricing and you know what happened this quarter versus the last couple of quarters and what you expect here going forward?
Peter Zaffino:  Sure, apart from a few lines like some property cat exposures, aviation, D&O for financial institutions, some parts of trade credit. The overall bulk of the property and casualty market is soft and I fear it's getting softer. And so from that standpoint I'm not counting on any tailwind, be it, to help us next year with regard to market pricing.
Operator:  We'll here from Cliff Gallant – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
Clifford Gallant – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods:  Just had two questions, first you talked a bit about the financial strength of the company, could you revisit the question of share repurchases? And then secondly, it seemed like you guys have done a number of what appears to be attractive deals in the quarter and you said that there are more coming up, and I realized that individually they might be a small part of the whole but collectively how meaningful should we think of them particularly when we think of earnings for next year and 2011?
Brian Duperreault:  Well, share repurchases, I've gotten this question before and as I've said to me you take – you have to decide what your priorities are and what is the best use. You have to decide what creates the most shareholder value. And right now when I look at the landscape I think there are acquisitions available that maybe wouldn't have been available in prior times or if available would've been much pricier.  So and we wouldn't have been able to take advantage of them anyway as I mentioned earlier because we weren't ready to take on additional issues, but today that's changed. And so I think for us the best use of our capital resources is to build this business in a strategic way and so that's what I'm going to do. We always evaluate the best use, and frankly, if share repurchases was the best use of capital we would do that but I don't think that's the case right now.  These acquisitions, I think particularly the ones in the Marsh McLennan agency space individually, yes, they'll be relatively small. Of course the guy selling to us won't think that way but they're relatively small, and collectively I think they'll be mighty. Now, in the beginning one or two it's like a drop by drop but eventually it's going to be quite large. And so I think certainly in the beginning parts of 2010 they won't be significant.  But as the momentum builds and we add one to another and we fill them out with the spokes I think you're going to find that eventually it's going to be a significant part of the business. And that may take us a couple of years, two, three years. But this is a very important initiative for us and we're going to do it right and it is no – it's a marathon in a way, so we want to make sure that they're the right ones for us, compatibility is important. But I think you'll see before you know it they'll be a very, very important part of who we are.
Operator:  Our next question will come from Meyer Shields – Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
Meyer Shields – Stifel Nicolaus & Co.:  Two quick questions, one, on the reinsurance business is there any way of either quantifying or estimating the impact of the Aon Benfield merger in terms of driving revenues to competitors like Guy Carpenter?
Peter Zaffino:  Well, when we look at and analyze our new business each quarter, for us, we were successful in many facets. We were successful of competing against our competitors in the reinsurance broker segment. We were successful against the directs but we were also very successful with our health portfolio in expanding reinsurance opportunities through discussing more around capital structure and how they're going to position themselves for 2010. So there's no specific trend in terms of where we're winning our new business but we've been successful in all areas.
Meyer Shields – Stifel Nicolaus &Co.:  Yes, and if I can follow up sort of on the retail side. I guess the only tailwind right now in retail brokerage is the fact that as the market softens further business that used to be wholesale is now retail. Does that quantify – does that affect, I should say, revenue growth at all? Is that tailwind at some point expect to avert?  
Brian Duperreault: Yes, I don't think so in respect to our case. The brokers who use wholesalers heavily do so because they have to access the placement talent that the wholesaler offers. So our business flow to wholesalers is not tremendously significant. We use wholesalers when we have to get to markets that we can't otherwise get to. So there's a few markets where we have to use wholesalers to get to. But the vast bulk of our placement activity we handle ourselves and so from that standpoint we don't flow or backwards flow that would otherwise go to wholesalers.
Operator:  We'll hear from Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan:  Couple big picture question if I may, just on the acquisition can you talk a little bit about what return hurdles or strategic hurdles you're using when you analyze these and maybe kind of the timeframe over which you think about these potential acquisitions?
Brian Duperreault:  Well, the number side, yes, I would say – I'm not going to give you a list of hurdles but there are quite a few we actually go through. Yes, obviously they have to be accretive and all that and they have to have good return on the investment. And we're disciplined about that so they really do need to match those. So that's the, I guess that's the beginning of it because you mentioned the strategic part and the quality of the people in that organization to me are always the most important.  It's the creed of nature from a personnel point of view that will ultimately win the day. It doesn't – you can overpay for something that's terrific and you'll never ask me what the price was. If I get a great deal on a mediocre property, you should ask me what the price was. And so but if you do both, now you got a winning combination and that's what – that's the way we're going about it. So the timing is – well acquisitions and timing they're – it's always very, very difficult.  I will tell you that on the agency side which is our biggest initiative we have an excellent pipeline and we've been very encouraged by the reception we received in the market from companies who we would love to have part of the group. So some will join and some we won't be able to meet their expectations and that's okay, they're quality companies. But I think the timing is going to be good but it's as I said we're not in a rush here we want to make sure we do it right.  The rest of acquisitions actually as much as you can plan for them, they come when you least expect them. And so the great thing about us right now is now we can take advantage of that. When they were coming – they were coming up before with just – I love to talk to you but I can't imagine trying to take that on at this point. So I think we are in a position where those wonderful opportunities now can be taken advantage of. I hope that answers the question.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan: Yes, no trouble, just clarification on the timing. I guess I was thinking more the timeframe over which you might measure return on capital or accretion because obviously if you're comparing the buybacks, buybacks are instant gratification, acquisitions sometimes take a little bit longer so that's what I was looking for there.
Brian Duperreault: Instant gratification, I love that. Well, I think we would say maybe five years would be a good reasonable period of time but in terms of accretion we'd like to see that pretty fast, first year. 
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan: Then the other question I had was your comments, particularly on the consulting, feeling like you were seeing some stabilization and the worst was behind you. I guess could you clarify is that just you're talking about stabilization in terms of the trends aren't getting any worse or you're actually feeling optimistic that perhaps, well maybe growth is a little too high a bar to shoot for but actually you're moving towards actually flat revenue growth in some of those businesses? 
Brian Duperreault:  Well, that's kind of what we're talking about with stabilization and comparisons. But I think John, who's with us in Dubai might give you a little bit more color on what he's seeing in terms of stabilization, so John, can you help us out?
John Drzik: I'm sorry Brian, am I on? Yes, so I think what we're seeing is that the bottom for us in terms of consulting demands was really in the first quarter of 2009 and it's since then there's been a gradual improvement, so it's still a decline versus 2008 but there's been sequential improvement in absolute revenues in Q2 and Q3, and in Q3 we were down 14% relative to '08 versus 19% in the first half of the year.  So we're expecting that sequential improvement in revenue and profitability to continue through the fourth quarter. And then going into 2010 I think it will depend on the pace of the economic recovery. If it's a more rapid recovery we could see a faster recovery and even growth in our business. If you see a slower recovery I think we'll still be stable and improving, but perhaps not at quite the pace that we could if there was a more substantial rebound.
Brian Duperreault:  Okay, John, let me ask Michele then to just talk about Mercer.
Michele Burns:  And I would agree with most of what John said, for our business we do lag a bit, so we actually went into more of the downturn much later. We did not see a downturn in our business until the fourth quarter of 2008. We are still lapping very strong comps from 2008 and practically, I think the business takes a little bit longer to recover. For example, a significant amount of our revenue is impacted by employee headcount.  So whether it's the [H&B] business or whether it's the outsourcing business, a number of employees on payroll is a relevant metric with regard to how our business will recover as we all believe that number is not likely to jump dramatically unless we have a more robust recovery than anyone is predicting. So I think we may lag a bit. Having said that, I think if you look at where we are in the third quarter, given the very strong comps we had in the third quarter of 2008, I would echo what Vanessa said which is that you could expect us to look a bit more like the full nine months as we go forward as opposed to expecting quite the same thing.  One bright spot I would call out with regard to our businesses because we do have a business that's stratified across, if you will, three, we call them pillars, but basically consulting, outsourcing and investments.  This quarter our investments pillar was quite strong, 8% growth in this quarter over strong comps actually and the assets under management – our assets under management in our investment management business hit an all time high in the third quarter of 2009 at $26.1 billion of assets under management. So again, as you look at our business it is a portfolio of services and we see different indications across them.
Brian Duperreault :  Ben, if you could just fill in what you see in Kroll?
Ben Allen:   Yes, I think similar kind of circumstance, so if you look at the last three quarters we've seen stabilization and revenue on a sequential basis, a bit of a rise in Q3 and obviously with the expense reductions better profitability. We're starting to see stabilization in the employment markets. Obviously we're not a proxy for the broader one, but in the ones that we play heavily in their stabilizing. Litigation seems to be returning to normal. I don't think you're going to see that there was significant changes in volume but you saw big changes in litigant behavior which can only – they can only hold out for so long right? So the settlement activity was higher, that seems to be abating a bit, more normal environment, and M&A seems to be returning a bit. So that kind of lines up what you're hearing from the others.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jay Cohen – Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay Cohen – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just a quick numbers question, what kind of tax rate should we be assuming going forward for the company?
Vanessa Wittman:   Sure Jay. We're continuing to give guidance on that in the 30% to 31% range going forward. It was a little lumpy this quarter because of the change in the mix of business over the quarter and the true ups the first nine months. But you should continue to plan on 30% to 31%.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital : I have three questions; they're all on risk insurance services. The first is, when should we anticipate that organic revenue growth in Risk and Insurance Services can get back to zero? The second is, should we anticipate that we should see a decline in Risk and Insurance Services expenses on an organic basis in 2010, and third, if you can update us on contingent commissions that'd be helpful?
Brian Duperreault : So Dan and Peter, you want to do an organic revenue growth back to zero? Well, that would be a decline for you Peter, but anyway let's.
Dan Glaser:   So to me a lot of our focus within Marsh is right now on organic growth. In fact I've got Joe McSweeney and [Alex Macharsky], my two major geographic leaders driving a global sales vision that we call Winning at Marsh. That involves not only creating specific sales executives with responsibilities in each region and each segment, but it also is strategic hiring in certain areas.  We have contracted with Salesforce.com to drive a global CRM system, so all of the Marsh activity with regard to prospecting and client relationship management will be done via Salesforce and we're implementing that now and we'll continue to do that through next year.  I've taken one of my senior executives, Hank Allen, and asked him to lead our multi-national effort. I believe that Marsh has the most cohesive global network in the world and I want to capture full competitive advantage from that network and so Hank is diving in and leading that.  We're also investing in employee benefits. Within the Marsh organization, our share of employee benefits is much smaller than our peer brokerage companies and we have been investing fairly extensively this year and we'll continue to do that. Now, that's all saying what we're doing in order to drive organic growth within the firm.  Obviously, we don't control the macro environment. We're a part of that macro environment. Where there is GDP growth we're capturing it. In fact we're doing better than that and I think that we're performing very well in many parts of the world in terms of growth.  Just to give you an idea, I mean I mentioned some territories before, but we had double digit growth in 13 countries or operating territories within Marsh in the quarter and more than half of that with growth of more than 20%. So the organization is positioned to grow and so therefore I think that we're poised – my own nose tells me that there's growth to be had.  Now we're planning all the way from what would be the impact of our business from our continued run rate in the segment as you know through nine months is I think minus one. So on the continued run rate to all the way from flat to plus one, plus two, plus three and one of the things and the levers that we can pull to make sure that we drive value for shareholders in all of those scenarios. So that's my view with regard to organic.  Maybe I'll touch on the contingencies and then I'll hand over to Peter for his views on organic growth within this segment. In terms of contingent income, we've been very consistent. Our view is that there should be a level playing field and we're focused on achieving a level playing field. Right now we're forced to play by different rules which puts us at a disadvantage from a revenue, margin and a cost perspective relative to most of the brokerage companies out there.  So, we're – one, a level playing field combined with transparency with clearer and more consistent disclosure for all brokers we think would result in a more competitive brokerage industry and would be sounder public policy.  Having said that, for the last couple of years we haven't been sitting on our hands in terms of carrier revenue streams, we have our enhanced commission initiative, in addition to that we have been doing our best to negotiate higher commission rates with carriers on our commission portfolios and we've been pretty successful in doing that.  And so I don't look at, as I've said before, we're not pining for the return of contingencies and I don't want to speculate on what impact that could have on different segments of our business because we haven't made those determinations where we're operating in the environment that we are held to via the settlement agreements and that's where we'll continue to operate.
Peter Zaffino:  In the reinsurance market in 2010 there will be more headwinds. You're going to have reduced exposures for primary companies, the pricing should flatten out and retentions will increase relative to what you saw during 2009. Having said that we still believe there are excellent opportunities for us to push organic growth. If you look at Guy Carpenter over all we're underweight in the international business. We've made significant strides in 2009, have had 20 plus percent organic growth in our Asia-Pacific region. But in the U.K. and Europe there's still a ways to go and that's going to be a huge focus for us in 2010 we've transferred [Britt Newhouse] over to the U.K. on a full time basis. He's been with Guy Carpenter for 30 plus years; he's our chairman, to help focus on organic growth. Henry Keeling, as Brian mentioned in the opening, has a very strong strategic plan of how we grow the U.K. and Europe so we feel that we can continue to grow organically in 2010 but we will have a little bit more headwinds than we faced in 2009.
Brian Duperreault: I was just going to say you asked us about the expenses, too, so we've had a positive relationship between organic growth and expense growth. I don't know if you guys want to comment any more about that? Yes, I would just say you can call me an old fashion P&L guy. I think that expenses are aligned with revenue. If you don't see our revenue grow you're not going to see our expenses grow. Period. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Larry Greenberg – Langen McAlenney.
Larry Greenberg – Langen McAlenney:  It's always been my perception that for Marsh first quarter margins were generally the highest and fourth quarter were generally second, and in the fourth quarter for Guy Carpenter it was generally a break even fourth quarter. Do those rules of thumb still apply?
Brian Duperreault: The answer's yes. The answer is yes Larry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Thomas Mitchell – Miller Tabak & Co.
Thomas Mitchell – Miller Tabak & Co. :  I just want to try to clarify what I thought I heard was a kind of warning on fourth quarter margin improvement not likely to be as strong as third quarter. But of course third quarter was really terrific.  My impression is that typically your fourth quarter insurance brokerage and risk services is stronger anyway than in the third quarter and that we should still be looking for some margin improvement and some improvement over fourth quarter 2008 levels. But I sort of want to double check that, is that right?
Brian Duperreault: Yes, I mean, we had a tremendous improvement in the third quarter over the year before so we're not predicting that change in the fourth quarter Thomas but we are continuing the process of improving this margin and getting it up at least to our peer levels and then we'll go from there to beat them. So no it's not a warning here. It's just a recognition that you've got to look at it sequentially. You got to recognize seasonality and with those caveats we're expecting improvement. 
Thomas Mitchell – Miller Tabak & Co. : And then also on the – sort of in the whole group of consulting businesses if we put them together it looks like you've really gotten your costs lined up with the revenue trends. Can we expect again going forward do we think that we pretty much seen the low in operating income if we include Kroll in the whole group?
Brian Duperreault: Yes, I think throwing Kroll in or taking them out the – to me, what we've done here – I know we've said okay we're going to go into this economic downturn. We have to pare our expenses to match our revenues much like Dan said. But what we didn't want to do was destroy the company in the process. We not only didn't destroy the company but as we pointed out Michele and John have and Ben have actually added. We haven't stopped investing, so we're better company today coming out of this thing than when we went into. So for us that's a great story. We think our margin improvement will be very, very good as revenues return. So yes, next year is feeling better for me frankly.
Operator: Your next question comes from [Teri Shoe].
[Teri Shoe]:  You were addressing the issues of margins. Was it – were you talking specifically, Brian, about the consulting margins in answer to Tom Mitchell's questions?
Brian Duperreault: Well, Tom, was actually referring to the insurance piece I believe because he was afraid of whether we were sending a warning and I think we answered that question. So no, it was – his question was insurance.
[Teri Shoe]:  Business insurance. Now on the consulting side if we looked at the aggregate margin you have third quarter versus the first half was much improved but it still on a nine month's basis lagging by quite a bit. When you commented earlier I think that the fourth quarter margins may not be quite as high. I think you were talking about Kroll, am I right?
Brian Duperreault: Yes, because Kroll's seasonality will – its fourth quarter is lighter.
[Teri Shoe]: Right but both for consulting and Kroll because the last couple of quarter from '08 on it's been, I mean, it's been challenging. It's hard to know what's normalized so as we go forward for fourth quarter and into 2010 for both consulting and for Kroll do we see a meaningful year-over-year improvement in the first half and so that the full year will be much better?  I'm not sure what – whether, I mean, what's normalized and next year with maybe the recovery not fully in place yet something lower so maybe a bit of guidance as to what one should look for in terms of normalized margins?
Brian Duperreault: All right. So I won't quantify it [Teri], but what I would tell you is looking at this year and what they've had to do to get their margins down as revenue improves the margins will improve. Now – and I think it'll be there will be some leverage in that. Now we have to see the revenue improve but what we have done I think is demonstrated the ability to hold the margins if revenue doesn't improve and if revenue improves it will improve.
Vanessa Wittman: It's also important to remember that that consulting segment will have overcome $70 million of FX impact on their NOI so as you look at the lumpiness, etc., that's a huge head winds that they've had to overcome this year. 
[Teri Shoe]: Okay, so as we look into just for consulting for fourth Q it will be at least as good as third Q and then going into 2010 as well is that a correct comment?
Brian Duperreault: Teri, no, well, I was talking about 2010. Fourth quarter we have to let this year play out. I mean we're lapping some issues. As Michele said her – the impact on Mercer was a little late relative to the others. So there's a little bit of timing issue here, so don't hold me to a single quarter.
[Teri Shoe]: And then a question on investment income I think Michele you gave guidance for the fourth quarter. How should we look at like into 2010 if you can refresh our memory as to what's the investment base and what would be kind of a normalized return if there is such a thing?
Vanessa Wittman:  That's all right. We generally, because we report our investment income on a lag we only go out one quarter, so I won't give you guidance for 2010. And we expect the fourth quarter of this year to roughly look like the fourth quarter of last year at about $19 million of investment income.
Brian Duperreault: Teri, let me move on if that's okay. Thanks, [Teri].
Operator: Your next question comes from Keith Walsh – Citi. 
Keith Walsh – Citi: Just two quick ones, for Peter, Guy Carpenter the revenue's at plus six. If you can specifically, what drove this growth? Was it new clients or was it renewal on your existing business, if you could specifically talk to that? And I've got a follow-up.
Peter Zaffino: Yes, we had increased new business which continued a very positive trend for us. Our renewal retentions increased and so that had a 30% plus benefit for us in the quarter when we looked year-over-year. And why that probably doesn't equate to what you saw in the first and second quarter is just a little bit more headwinds on retentions and then some [race]. And so we started to see some fall off from the third quarter, although not significant.
Keith Walsh – Citi: Okay, so renewals actually were a big driver of that plus – a bigger driver of the plus six in new business. Is that what you're saying?
Peter Zaffino: No. No, what I'm saying is from a percentage standpoint we had our renewal retentions went up and therefore when you look at it year-over-year that was a benefit but the new business was a larger contributor than the renewal retentions.
Brian Duperreault: There was less pressure from retention, right, so your new business actually shows the growth and that's the point. Yes.
Keith Walsh – Citi: Okay, and then just last one for Dan, if you could just comment on new business and retention at Marsh and then when we think about organic growth, sort of the break down between units and pricing growth on both of those components? 
Dan Glaser:  That's one of those multi-variable questions that – but let me address it this way. When we're looking at the, or when we – when we're looking at the growth in the components of growth within new business versus retention, our new business rates for any organization are actually very strong. I've looked and obviously we've been looking at other companies over the course of the last year or so, looking at what new business has generated as a percentage of their base. And then I look at what we do at Marsh and we produce an awful lot of new business. That's both from new-new and what we call expanded business, so both of that is very strong. In fact, in the quarter our new business was over $190 million, right? So that is an awful lot of new business and so where we've been I would say, winning in the marketplace. Now, having said that, and as I talked about economic activity and the like, that new business of $190 million is not as strong just on an absolute dollar basis as the third quarter of '08, right, but it was in our view a strong quarter.  When I look at what, in terms of account retention, our account retention levels are at historical high levels. I've ignored the – I don't ignore it – but I discount the period in March of five, six and seven in terms of where the account retention levels were and I look to 1002, 2002, 2003, and we're back to those levels. So our account retention levels are very strong and in most parts of our business in most geographies they're in the mid-90s.
Brian Duperreault: I think we should take one more question and then draw this to a close. Is there another question?
Operator: Your final question comes from Meyer Shields – Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
Meyer Shields – Stifel Nicolaus & Co.: Really quickly, can we get the net income impact by segment from foreign exchange in the quarter?
Vanessa Wittman: In the quarter it was $9 million at Mercer, which I mentioned in my comments, $12 million total negative for consulting, $10 million positive for Risk and Insurance Services and nothing at Kroll, so overall minus $2 million for the quarter in foreign exchange.
Brian Duperreault: Well then I'm going to draw this to a close and I want to thank everybody for your attention and for the questions and look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you all for joining.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the MMC’s conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. The second quarter 2009 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the MMC’s Web site at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. In particular, references during this call to anticipated or expected results of operations for 2009 or subsequent periods are forward-looking statements, and MMC’s actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. Please refer to MMC’s most recent SEC filings as well as the company’s earnings release, which are available on the MMC Web site for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. At this time, I would now turn the conference over to Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC. Please go ahead, sir.
Brian Duperreault: Thank you. Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I’m Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me in presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. I’d also like to welcome our operating companies CEOs to today’s call, Dan Glaser of Marsh; Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter; Michele Burns of Mercer; John Drzik of Oliver Wyman; and, Ben Allen of Kroll. Also with us is Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations. First, I’ll make some brief comments on each of our businesses and then turn it over to Vanessa to provide additional information regarding our financial results. Then, we’d be more than happy to take the questions. Overall, we had a great quarter in light of the difficult economic environment. Most notably, we saw another significant improvement in profitability in the risk and insurance services segment. This has been a continuing trend since the first quarter of 2008. The main driver for the segment’s increase and profitability is continued improvement at Marsh. In the current quarter, Marsh’s underlying revenue was flat, which we consider a reasonable outcome in this environment. In certain countries where the economic slowdown was not as severe, we saw double-digit revenue growth. And other markets’ revenue was flat or slightly down due to the economic climate. Overall, we are pleased with the revenue levels we saw in the second quarter. That, coupled with expense discipline, led to a marked improvement in Marsh’s profitability. And this was achieved despite the continuing soft insurance marketplace. Not only is Marsh more profitable today, but it is a stronger company. As we have discussed in previous quarter, Dan and his team have re-engineered the Marsh business over the past 18 months, streamlining the organizational structure while keeping a sharp eye on expenses. Today’s Marsh has been organized, with stronger management both at the senior leadership level as well as in the field. In the second quarter, Marsh continued to produce substantial amounts of new business. In the US, new placement hubs are leading to improve transactional capabilities. And by segmenting clients, Marsh is now delivering improved service more efficiently. Marsh is also balancing expense management with the opportunity to bring in talent at appropriate levels and for new initiatives such as the Marsh & McLennan Agency. While reducing staff levels since the start of 2008, Marsh also hired about 150 client-facing managing directors and senior vice presidents. This redeployment of resources is another element of Marsh’s re-engineering. Going forward, continued operation improvements and initiatives have positioned Marsh for further profitability growth in Marsh and expansion. Guy Carpenter also had an excellent quarter. Underlying revenue increase 11% fueled by increased new business. We have seen strong new business at Carpenter at each of the last four quarters. As a result of strong revenue growth and cost reduction, Carpenter saw significant increase in profitability. During the quarter, Carpenter made significant hires to its executive and sales teams. These new colleagues bring a wealth of skills to the firm in the areas of analytics, business development, and international experience. Finally, we’re extremely pleased with the acquisition and integration of Collins, which further strengthens Carpenter’s specialty capabilities and diversifies its position in North America. The improved margin for the risk and insurance services segment over the past year is a clear indicator of the significant improvement in profitability. Over the trailing four quarters, adjusted operating margin for the segment increased to 16.6% from 10.3% a year ago. On our last earnings call, we indicated our adjusted operating margin target for this year was 17%. Now, recognizing Marsh and Carpenter’s excellent performance in the quarter, combined with our outlook for the remainder of the year, we’re raising our target margin for the risk and insurance services segment to 18% for 2009. Obviously, this is a marked improvement from a margin of 13.3% in 2008 and represents the 300 basis point margin expansion for the second half of the year. Turning to our consulting segment, recessionary continue -- conditions continue to affect both Mercer and Oliver Wyman, but to varying degrees. Mercer delivered a respectable performance in the current environment, with strong expense control offset by a modest revenue decline. Profitability was negatively impacted by foreign exchange as well as an increase in professional liability costs. Given the deteriorating economy at the end of last year, Mercer’s management team started 2009 knowing the road ahead would be a difficult one. Accordingly, they increased expense reductions to protect profitability. They calibrated their operations to the environment and implemented increasingly aggressive expense reduction initiatives in each of the last three quarters. For the first six months, Mercer has held its ground on revenue in its two largest practices, retirement and health and benefits. Revenue was flat and up 1% in these areas, respectively. Investment business -- the investment business has also grew 4% during the first half. For Oliver Wyman, the operating environment continues to be the most challenging one they have faced in years. The softness in demand has varied by industry group. Financial services, Oliver Wyman’s largest practice, saw double-digit decline in revenue in the second half of 2008 due to the financial crisis. In the first half of this year, the year-over-year decline moderated the middle single digits. Conversely, demand for our manufacturing, transportation, and energy group held up well through 2008, but is down over the last two quarters. Where appropriate and necessary, John and his team have reduced consultant capacity and discretionary expenses since the beginning of the year. As a result, Oliver Wyman’s profitability in the second quarter significantly improved compared with the first quarter. Therefore, we feel the first quarter represented the bottom of the cycle for Oliver Wyman’s profitability. And finally, Kroll, a year ago, we determined that there were several distances that did not fit in into Kroll’s long term business strategy. Late last year, we divested the corporate advisory and restructuring business. And in May of this year, we sold Kroll’s government services business. This simplifies Kroll’s business in keeping with the strategy we announced a year ago. In closing, let me say that I am pleased and is encouraged by the progress that the senior leadership team has made at MMC. In 2008, we focused on correcting several internal issues. This took considerable time and effort to repair, and are now largely behind us. In 2009, we are contending with a challenging external operating environment that has tested us for nearly a year. Throughout MMC, we have made the changes necessary to deal with a recession and on a whole, we are not only weathering the storm, but in many areas, performing well. We have implemented initiatives in each of our businesses that have increased efficiencies and a led that’s well positioned for future growth. And we are excited about MMC’s long term prospects. With that, I’ll turn it over to Vanessa.
Vanessa Wittman: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we continue to face significant economic headwinds, including declines in short term interest rates, continued investment losses, and the impact of foreign exchange. Before I move to our operating results, let me cover the Kroll goodwill impairment. In the second quarter, the sale of Kroll’s government services business triggered evaluation review of Kroll. This review resulted in a non-cash charge of $315 million or $0.60 per share. We’ll be completing the step two phase of the assessment in the third quarter, which is also when we routinely evaluate the goodwill of all of MMC’s operations. There’s no tax benefit relating to this charge nor any impact at MMC’s cash flows or tangible equity, nor is there any consequence to outstanding debt covenants. Now, let’s turn to MMC’s results on an adjusted basis, which we believe are more indicative of our core operating performance this quarter. In the second quarter, MMC’s adjusted EPS was $0.33. This compares with $0.39 last year. Kroll government services, which is now reflected as a discontinued operation, is excluded from adjusted earnings in both periods. Before turning to the operating segments, I’ll touch on corporate interest expense and investment income. Not only did we overcome the impact of lower interest rates on fiduciary interest income, net corporate interest expense reduced EPS by $0.02. Separately, investment losses reduced the EPS by an additional $0.02. This was due to declines in our private equity portfolio, which I recorded on our one-quarter lag. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate investment income of about $20 million, compared with a loss of $23 million in the third quarter of 2008. Now, I’d like to move to a segment review. As I discuss the financial performance of our operating companies, all my references will be to underlying revenue, underlying expenses, and adjusted operating income. Excluding fiduciary interest income, revenue for risk and insurance services increased 2% to $1.3 billion. More importantly, despite a $23 million reduction in fiduciary interest income, operating income rose from $207 million to $271 million, an increase of 31%. Both Marsh and Guy Carpenter had strong percentage growth in operating income, resulting in a 560-basis point margin improvement for this segment for the second quarter of last year. Now that we are (inaudible) expense reduction initiatives from last year, our year-over-year improvement in margins is moderating. As you heard from Brian, we still expect to see a fairly significant improvement in margin in the second half of the year on a year-over-year basis. Therefore, we have raised our margin target for the risk and insurance services segment to 18% for 2009. This represents a 470 basis point improvement from 2008. This also will more than double the operating margin within a two-year period. Looking at Marsh’s second quarter results, revenue was flat, a slight improvement from the first quarter. The client revenue retention rate rose 100 basis points on a sequential basis, reflecting a marked improvement in the US and Canada. Revenue retention was unchanged year-over-year. Reduced general insurance activity as a result of the global economic downturn and a continuing soft market for commercial property casualty insurance reduced the level of new business in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis, but was consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. Revenue for international operations, which accounted for 48% of Marsh’s second quarter revenue was flat, as a 1% decline in EMEA was offset by growth of 9% in Latin America and 1% in Asia Pacific. Revenue in the US and Canada was flat, a solid improvement from the first quarter. Ongoing across the board expense reduction initiatives drove Marsh’s operating expenses down 6% in the second quarter. Guy Carpenter’s revenue growth was 11%, marking the first time in more than five years that Carpenter has achieved double-digit revenue growth in consecutive quarters. As it has over the past year, Carpenter produced strong new business in the quarter, a testament to the approach taken by Peter and his team to re-shape operations since the spring of last year. And I’m pleased to say Carpenter -- Carpenter’s retention rate returned to the historically high level we enjoyed prior to 2008. At the same time, effective expense controls have remained in place, resulting in expenses being held back in the quarter. As a result, Guy Carpenter achieved excellent growth and profitability for the fourth consecutive quarter. Turning to our consulting segment, let’s start with our third headwind, foreign exchange. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the consulting segment by $26 million or $0.03 in a quarter, with over $19 million at Mercer. We expect foreign exchange to negatively impact Mercer for one more quarter. Turning to Mercer, in the first six of two -- first six months of 2009, revenue at Mercer’s two largest practices held up well, even in the most difficult operating environment in many years. Retirement revenue declined just 2% in the second quarter, but was flat year-to-date. Health and benefits also declined 2% in the quarter, but increased 1% year-to-date. Outsourcing declined 5% in the second quarter and 8% for the first six months. This was primarily due to the sharp year-over-year decline in the securities market, which affected revenue tied to assets under administration. Investment consulting and management grew 2% in the quarter and 4% for the six months. Michele and her team continue to do an excellent job of dealing with very difficult market conditions. On a year-over-year basis, second quarter operating expenses decrease 3% and excluding the $30 million increase in professional liability costs, Mercer's expenses would have declined 6%. At Oliver Wyman second quarter revenue of $311 million decrease 19%, similar to the first quarter. Oliver Wyman implemented significant staff reductions in the first six months of the year. As we described last quarter, Oliver Wyman's severance cost, which are capacity related are included in operating results, not restructuring. In the second quarter, even including $8 million of severance cost, operating expenses decrease 17% on a year-over-year basis. Now, let me move to risk consulting and technology. In May, we completed the sale of our US government security clearance screening business for all government services. MMC's prior results have been restated to reflect Kroll government services as discontinued operations. Information for the past five quarters is included in the supplemental schedules in our press release. To varying degrees, Kroll continues to feel the effects of the recession in each of its businesses, revenue with $161 million, a decrease of 24% from the second quarter of 2008. Excluding the Goodwill impairment, expenses were down 14% compared with 7% in the first quarter, reflecting management's continuing efforts to deal with these extremely harsh conditions. Now looking at MMC's capital structure, our balance sheet remains strong. We made a discretionary pension contribution in the second quarter to our UK defined benefit plan of about $70 million, a similar amount to the January contribution. These contributions are in addition to the scheduled contributions we mix with the plans throughout the year. We do not currently anticipate additional discretionary contributions this year. In June, we repaid our $400 million senior debt maturity with proceeds from the March debt issuance. Our next bond maturity is in September 2010 for $550 million. MMC has no outstanding commercial paper or bank loans. Our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility remains un-drawn. Net debt decreased $278 million from the end of the first quarter to $2.3 billion at June 30th. And we ended the second quarter with $1.3 billion of cash. With that, let me turn it back to Brian.
Brian Duperreault: Thanks, Vanessa. We're ready to begin our Q&A session and just a reminder, we have our operating companies’ CEOs here, and Vanessa, to help to answer any questions. There you have it. So operator, we're ready to begin.
Operator: (Operator instructions) We'll take our first question from Keith Walsh.
Keith Walsh - Citi: Hey, good morning, everybody.
Brian Duperreault: Good morning, Keith.
Keith Walsh - Citi: Hi. How are you? First question I guess for Dan, with the significant improvement we've seen especially year-to-date in the margins, has there been any change, and I think you partially answered this with the margin guidance for the year, but any change in the seasonality that we will see with the margin throughout the year in risk and insurance services?
Dan Glaser: Yes. Hi, Keith. No, there's no change in the seasonality. If you look back to last year over the four quarters and you look at the first, second, and fourth, and then compare the third, the average revenue for the three quarters, and I mentioned the first, second, and fourth at $1.16 billion, and it was $1.04 billion in the third, so there's a $112 million difference in revenue in the third quarter. And if you just look at the dates of key renewal dates, there's only one key renewal date on the third quarter and that's July 1st. So while we look at most of our expenses as being straight lined across the year, so our expenses are very stable already adjusted in the third quarter.
Keith Walsh - Citi: Okay, very helpful. And then just for Brian, a follow-up, Brian or Dan. Just on contingent commissions, I'm sure you've seen the Illinois Attorney General allowing Arthur Gallagher to accept them back. Is this essentially -- I know the NYAG is your regulator here, but is this essentially a non-event or is it inevitable? Do you think that the NYAG moves in that direction? Thanks.
Brian Duperreault: Right, I think we executed a question. Well, I would say the first part of this and I think Dan might want to comment too, but I think, in general, the commissioner has been quite clear -- the superintendent in New York has been quite clear about his feelings on it. And we're encouraged by that. But I know Dan wanted to say something else.
Dan Glaser: Sure. I mean, Keith, you know we've been consistently and publicly advocating for a level playing field and transparency. We're all brokers or subject to the same set of rules. In two-tiered markets that have existed for the last five years, it did not sound public policy in our view. We look at the recent action by the Attorney General in Illinois and we think it's an important step in fixing a broken system. We also commend New York. I mean New York has been working over the past year to draft a balanced producer compensation regulation. We believe our settlement agreement should be sunset and we look forward to competing on the same terms as other intermediaries at some point of the future.
Keith Walsh - Citi: Great. Thank you.
Brian Duperreault: Okay, Keith.
Operator: Thank you. We now move on to Larry Greenberg.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Thanks and good morning. Two questions, one, can you discuss how potential health care reform could impact your businesses? And then secondly, would you say that you’re a beneficiary of some of the consolidation that's taking place in the re-insurance brokerage sector?
Brian Duperreault: Ah, okay. Well, those are two different operating company questions. So Michele, why don't you do the health care, and we'll have Peter talk about re-insurance.
Michele Burns: Obviously, in our business, first of all, generally, change in any of our businesses signals some good times, if you will, for Mercer. Those changes result in client tending to react and respond. We're watching the health care legislation in this country obviously very, very closely, and over the longer term, certain aspects of that legislation that's being bandaged about could have some negative impact on our business. But it’d be a very long term issue and in the short to mid term, all the energy that's going into health care reform and the most likely outcomes from the legislation would likely fuel our business for sometime to come. So we're quite comfortable with where we sit with regard to that and watch it with great interest.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: What would be the negative issues?
Michele Burns: Well, for example, if we were to go completely to a socialized medicine system where there was one big payor [ph], it would significantly change how we think about it. We would still have a business in the United States very much akin to how it’s conducted in several of the countries in Europe, but it would be a significant change in one that is not exactly what the commerce is considering now at any rate.
Brian Duperreault: Okay. Larry, let me have Peter talk about the reinsurance consolidation.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Okay.
Peter Zaffino: The consolidation, we think will have benefits for Guy Carpenter in the future. If we look at our current quarter, we had excellent retention from clients measured by number of clients or revenue, and saw about a 20% increase in new business. The new business came predominantly from current clients and that was really driven by the value that we have brought to our clients, and focus around capital. But believe that Guy Carpenter is very well positioned as a very strong choice as we look to future quarters of next year.
Brian Duperreault: Okay, now?
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Yes and then just to follow-up. The trend, you mentioned 150 new senior hires, can you give us some sense on how that's developed, maybe Q1, Q2?
Brian Duperreault: Yes. Those were in March -- I think Dan can give you that.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: I’m sorry --
Brian Duperreault: That’s all right. Dan will answer anyway.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Okay.
Dan Glaser: And that kind of Q1 and Q2 thing, that's really starting from really the second quarter of 2008.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Right.
Dan Glaser: Now those more than 150 managing directors and SVPs, more than 80% are in client facing roles.
Brian Duperreault: Peter, we did mention that you brought some people on. You might give some color on that too?
Peter Zaffino: Sure, we add, as Brian said in his opening remarks, we had a three senior executives that will each position us for future growth, in particular, Henry Keeling in our international business. We believe that that's the strongest opportunity for Guy Carpenter going forward. And we're going to invest a lot of the resources that we put into the organization and focus growth in the international space. We're very excited. We have over 30 strategic hires that we put on board since the beginning of the year, all really playing an important role in our growth strategies so we're very excited about the future.
Brian Duperreault: Okay.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Thank you.
Brian Duperreault: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Brian Meredith. Please state your company name.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Yes, UBS. A couple of questions -- good morning, everybody. The first one, Brian, can you talk a little about what your plans are to do with all this cash that you're accumulating and historically, typically, you got a lot of cash accumulate in the second half of the year also.
Brian Duperreault: Okay, I’ll start with that, Brian. Yes, thanks, it's interesting, but given the economic conditions you almost can't have too much cash. We are very focused on liquidity issues and I mentioned that we are interested in growing too. We feel there's been a lot of time in the last 18 months and the last six months trying to get our company in good order to go from defense to offense. And I think we're in a position to do that. So it's a nice position to be in and we'll see what happens to that cash.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Great. And then two other just quick ones here, private equity going forward, should we expect that to stabilize here going forward?
Brian Duperreault: The private equity piece --
Brian Meredith - UBS: Yes.
Brian Duperreault: Vanessa?
Vanessa Wittman: Yes, as you know, Brian, we report on a one quarter leg, so we can give you visibility into next quarter. And really, given the volatility, we would be reluctant to comment beyond that, but we are indeed hoping for stabilization over the future quarters.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Okay. And then last quick question for Michele, so I have everybody here -- mostly everybody. In the quarter, did we -- was there any impact from a slow down in maybe client buying because of what’s going on with health care reform and this uncertainty as far as what's going on?
Michele Burns:
Brian Meredith - UBS: Thank you.
Brian Duperreault: Good. Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. We move to our next question from Meyer Shields. Please state your company name.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks, Stifel Nicolaus. Good morning, everyone. As I understand it, the margin lines you gave last quarter did not include Collins? I’m assuming the 18% does?
Brian Duperreault: The 18% does and I think by default, the one before did too. So I'm not sure that we said it wasn’t in, but anyway, let’s say the 18% definitely includes Collins.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. That's fine. When we look at -- I want to play off of Brian's question, within reinsurance, because of the consolidation, I guess there would be a couple of impacts. One would be the temporary uncertainty or unusual movements that typically follow that sort of thing. And the second would be improving pricing capabilities because they are now in the free global reinsurance broker. Is there anyway of ball parking the different impacts of those two phenomena?
Brian Duperreault: You want me to do it, Peter? You might -- Peter says please do it, yes. I think pricing, it's a competitive market and I don't think that frankly, the pricing is going to be affected by that. We get paid because of the services we provide and I think these are very sophisticated buyers. They know the insurance business well and you got to earn every penny you make. So I would put that aside. There are fewer competitors, fewer choices -- companies want to have balance, so I think those are things that will affect it. We're subject to market conditions and those have been slightly positive this year but not overwhelmingly so. So I think that probably has much more to do with the future revenue. And I think expansions, so for us, you heard what Peter said, we are a very global company in general. But in Guy Carpenter we have been less so, very, very strong in the US and less outside the US, and its -- If you look at the trends in insurance the activity is predominantly outside the US. And so, for us it’s almost like a green field. So we’re very positive about Henry’s entrance and our ability to add around him people who have a market presence. And that’s where we expect to grow.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus: The one point I think, Brian, that you brought up which is key, the consolidation is going to force the reinsurance intermediary offering to be more complex. And we’re talking more about capital today; we’re getting in and giving more advice or services. So what the offering is today compared to what it was a couple of years ago is much broader. And the general rate and structure is starting to level off. It had a neutral impact on our portfolio in the second quarter, and even though we saw some property tax increases, there’s plenty of headwinds still with subject premium basis and also some of the casualty lines have not moved in a positive direction. So it’s really been driven for us through new business.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus: Does the--
Brian Duperreault: Okay. Meyer?
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus: I’m sorry, yes.
Brian Duperreault: Okay. Next question, please. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Matt Heimermann. Please state your company name.
Matt Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: Hi, J.P. Morgan. Good morning everybody.
Brian Duperreault: Good morning, Matt.
Matt Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: Brian or Dan, on the whole contention commission issue, I guess the one thing I’m struggling with and thinking about this is in fact, superintendent New York AG, due sunset, the agreements you’re subject to is, the whole issue of RIMS stands against contingent commissions as well as just, I think, what are probably higher transparency standards for you in disclosing total payments from brokers and underwriters. And so, can you talk about if this does go away from a practical standpoint what it really means in terms of incremental compensation or recapture of compensation from the past?
Dan Glaser: Yes. (inaudible), sure. Let me address it this way, our focus is on achieving a level playing field. I will say that from our perspective, the issue of contingent compensation is a bit of a red herring. The real issue is carrier revenue streams, transparency, and disclosure practices, and internal systems and controls which are designed to manage conflict of interest. There are several carrier revenue streams today. The brokers including Marsh are permitted to accept basic commissions and supplemental, enhanced fee for services, work transfer, and more. So really, I would approach it this way. All carrier revenue streams represent a potential conflict of interests. Therefore, for us, the real issues are transparency, what disclosure practice that each company has, what the internal controls are to manage potential conflicts. I don’t want to speak for RIMS, but I think RIMS’ principal issue -- well, they’ve been consistently against contingent commissions for quite some time. But I think they would be vehemently against the notion of contingent commission which is not paired with full and transparent disclosure.
Matthew Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: In just following up on that, let’s say that there was full disclosure and contingents were allowed, is that something that we should expect to suddenly be a tail end for you from a revenue perspective? Or if you get full and complete transparence, is it, is it -- are clients necessarily going to be willing to pay bigger sticker?
Dan Glaser: Yes, Matt, I follow. I don’t want to speculate specifically about contingent commissions right now. But I have talked in previous quarters about our enhanced commission initiatives, which are fully disclosed and they don’t -- they’re not variable. So they’re fixed and they’re not influenced by volume or profit. And so I think enhanced commission for Marsh is really the staple of where we look at enhancing our carrier revenue stream based upon the value that we provide the carriers. We’ve been very successful over the past several quarters in getting more and more carriers to accept the notion of our value creation in developing agreements. In fact, we have more than 30 agreements to date on the enhanced commission front. And we do disclose enhance commissions to our clients, and we require the client to agree to the level of enhanced commission before we sign off. And frankly, I’ve been more than satisfied with our level of client acceptance.
Matthew Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you for that. And then just maybe a big picture, I don’t know if this is Michele or Brian, but I think it was your comment, Brian that you think you’re at the bottom of the earnings cycle within that consulting segment. And the question I have is, is that a function of your visibility with respect to expenses or do you actually feel like, from a revenue perspective, you’re seeing some signs, but then the organization had actually the worst of the revenue declines that we’ve seen at this point?
Brian Duperreault: Yes, there’s obviously parts -- different parts to the consulting. When I started the comments, I made particular note of the expenses because we had to adjust our expenses to our revenue. So in a significantly -- this year our ability to hold margins at reasonable levels has to do with that. So going forward, when I mentioned the -- out of the Wyman’s situation, it was that we got to that point. And I mentioned that we had -- it’s a little bit than we expect, so we had financial services dragging us down, but now, coming back. And with the shifted -- as the economy has shifted to difficulties more than manufacturing sectors. So I think for us, we see maybe a little bit of stability overall in the revenues and in Oliver Wyman. And that, coupled with the improvement and the expense posture that led me to believe that that’s why we’re at the bottom for them. Michele’s a slightly different situation, but her revenues weren’t as severely affected as they were at Oliver Wyman. We mentioned the fact we are up in a couple of other segments. And the big business retirement, and health and benefits actually over the year flat and slightly up 1% over six months, and I think the six months are representative of that. So, that’s why we’re feeling a little bit more optimistic with respect to both of those pieces of the consulting business.
Matthew Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: That’s helpful. Just one numbers question, is -- was there any other severance reported in the consulting segment this quarter besides the $8 million? And is that something that, by the time we’re through the third quarter, that severance impact can pretty much work its way out unless there’s new announcements?
Brian Duperreault: Vanessa?
Vanessa Wittman: Yes, I’ll take it in two pieces. There was a portion -- there was some severance that ran through Mercer’s P&L, about $4 million. And as to future quarters, I think it’s really going to depend on how the revenue is coming in. All of these units will continue to look hard at expenses matching that revenue.
Matthew Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thank you.
Brian Duperreault: Okay, Matt? Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll move on to Thomas Mitchell. Please state your company name.
Thomas Mitchell - Miller Tabak: Miller Tabak. First of all, I just want to double check if there has been any reclassification of expenses away from insurance brokerage and to the parent company over the last thee or four quarters? I just want to double check that first.
Brian Duperreault: No, Tom. No.
Thomas Mitchell - Miller Tabak: Okay.
Brian Duperreault: All right.
Thomas Mitchell - Miller Tabak: So--
Brian Duperreault: They did it on their own. They did it on their own, Tom.
Thomas Mitchell - Miller Tabak: Okay, a real margin improvement and then--
Brian Duperreault: Real margin improvement.
Thomas Mitchell - Miller Tabak: The second factor is -- other brokers are talking about the fact that even though you’re very large, they tell you about the fact that there seems to be an opportune time to approach -- it’s probably wrong to call them the mom and pops, but to approach a smaller agencies and other brokers, particularly in the United States with the kind of value proposal to join your team. And I’m wondering if you’re seeing any uptake in the ease and ability with which you may be able to approach tuck-under acquisitions?
Brian Duperreault: Yes, Tom, we have an issue of -- that we called Marsh McLennan Agency, very much in that stage you’re talking to, and then Mike might give us an update on that.
Mike Bischoff: Yes, absolutely. Well the US market in particular is very fragmented in the mom and pop, and above into small and middle market space. And we formed the Marsh & McLennan Agency in higher divestment, like the former CEO of US side, to led our initiative in that area. And we’re talking to a lot of people. I’m actually very pleased with what our pipeline looks like. Though we’re not compelled to do anything, but we’re having a lot of interesting conversations with quality firms led by quality individuals. The one thing that I would create any misperception that -- in acquisition in that space or series of acquisitions would be us talking them into Marsh. I’m very comfortable with running separate businesses and the Marsh & McLennan Agency will be run as a separate business within the Marsh Inc. family, obviously, but this will not be an integration of these agencies into Marsh in the US.
Brian Duperreault: Okay, Tom?
Thomas Mitchell - Miller Tabak: That’s very good, thank you very much.
Brian Duperreault: Okay, good. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question will be a follow up form Meyer Shields.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks. Two really good questions, one, Vanessa what was the overall impact of foreign exchange to adjusted operated income?
Vanessa Wittman: About $0.03, it was largely in the consulting -- it was, actually all of the $0.03 was in the consulting businesses whore risk and insurance services were neutral to FX in the period.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Thanks. And to just sort of delving into reinsurance again, and I think Peter talked a little bit about how the client demand more flat. Traditionally, reinsurance has seen higher margins. Does this more complex consulting change that at all?
Brian Duperreault: Peter?
Peter Zaffino: I’m sorry, I didn’t hear.
Brian Duperreault: Well, the question is now we have a more complex offering. Reinsurance is a high margin business. Has the complexity changed that level of margin?
Peter Zaffino: I don’t think it will impact the margin. What it’s going to do is require companies to have scale. It’s going to require companies to make investments to be able to have that broader product offering, and that’s going to be focusing around key strategies of our clients, but focusing around capital because we are seeing retentions are moving up, as recent survey said that trend will continue. Of insurance companies asked, over 80% had issues retentions continue to go up helping manage that volatility to value-added services, which are modeling and working closely with them on their capital structure is going to be crippled, so you need scale and you need to make investments and reorganization in order to able to pull that off.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus: Are you expecting more consolidation on your competitors because of that?
Brian Duperreault: I don’t expect much more consolidation. There are really three large reinsurance brokers and there’s several other brokers that have boutique offerings. It would surprise me if one or two perhaps were acquired, but I don’t see anything in the foreseeable future that would be strategic in terms of acquisitions.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Brian Duperreault: Okay. Meyer, next question.
Operator: Our next question will be a follow-up from Keith Walsh.
Keith Walsh - Citi: Okay. Thanks,, guys. Brian just for you, two quick follow ups, just on M&A here. Would you consider buying something outside of brokerage? And then I got a follow up.
Brian Duperreault: Buying something out of brokerage?
Keith Walsh - Citi: Like in consulting, would you redeploy--
Brian Duperreault: Yes, the answer’s yes. And in fact, we have been acquiring. And that we haven’t really done anything in the last three months, but since I arrived, there’s been several acquisitions and we think it’s a worthy place to put our money.
Keith Walsh - Citi: And then, just my last question and with your stock at one time revenue, which is the lowest it’s been at 30 years, your margins are clearly on the path to being fixed. Wouldn’t a best return on your investment instead of buying something in a soft market, in the consulting side be from buying back your stock right here?
Brian Duperreault: Buying back your stock. Well, I’m -- my opinions on stock buy backs have been well-documented, and look, it’s a question of what is the best value for the funds we have? And my preference is to find business that grows our business, that’s strategic in value that returns over a long period of time. And so, that’s my priority. Now, if you can’t find those and there are circumstances that might prevent that, you’d have to consider stock buy back. But it’s a question of priority, and think that’s the right priority, it’s my priority. Okay, Keith?
Keith Walsh - Citi: Yes, thank you.
Brian Duperreault: Okay, next question.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I’ll turn it back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Brian Duperreault: Well, I thank everybody for participating and I thank my colleagues who are doing a great job. And I look forward to talk to you next quarter. Thank you. Bye.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentleman. That does conclude today’s conference call. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to MMC’s conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. The first quarter 2009 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on MMC’s website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind you, that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherit risks and uncertainties. In particular, references during this conference call to anticipated or expected results of operations for 2009 or subsequent periods are forward-looking statements and MMC’s actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. Please refer to MMC’s most recent SEC filings, as well as the company’s earnings release, which are available on MMC’s website for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement made today. I will now turn the call over to Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC. Please go ahead. 
Brian Duperreault: Good morning and thank you for joining us, to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I’m Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me and presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. I’d also like to welcome our operating companies CEOs to today’s call, Dan Glaser of Marsh; Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter; Michele Burns of Mercer; John Drzik of Oliver Wyman; and Ben Allen of Kroll. Also with us is Mike Bishchoff, our Head of Investor Relations. After I make some brief remarks, Vanessa will present our financial results and then we will take your questions. Overall I’m pleased with our first quarter results. Despite the significant hurdles we faced in the quarter, which Vanessa will outline. MMC produced $390 million of adjusted operating income, an increase from $386 million in the prior year. Most notably, we saw significant improvement in the Risk and Insurance Services segment. When I joined MMC in early 2008, one of my key priorities was to improve the operating margin in this segment to close the substantial gap with our direct competitors. At that time, the adjusted margin for Risk and Insurance Services for 2007 was only 8.6%. After very strong growth and profitability throughout 2008, the adjusted operating income within Risk and Insurance Services rose 30% in the first quarter of 2009 and adjusted margin increased to 25% from 17.6%. So, if you look at the margin for this segment over the past four quarters, it was 15.1%. This is a notable achievement within a 15 month period. On our last call, we told you we had a goal of an adjusted margin of 16% for 2009. Given our assumption of modest revenue growth and the strong first quarter performance at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter, we are now raising our targeted adjusted margin for the segment to 17% for 2009. In Marsh’s international operations, underlying revenue growth was 4%, reflecting a strong position in many regions around the world. Our international operations for the most part enjoy high margins. So, the focus here is and has been on increasing revenues. In the U.S. Marsh’s top line was affected by the softness in the economy, we looked implementation of a new business model and a heavy focus on expense reduction and margin improvement. Overall Marsh’s underlying revenue was down slightly in the quarter, which we consider a reasonable outcome in this environment. Most importantly, Dan and his team delivered another significant increase in profitability in the first quarter. It is clear that the restructuring efforts over the past year have been very successful. Going forward Marsh’s continued operational improvements and initiatives are designed to enhance service to clients while positioning Marsh for further profitable growth and margin expansion. Guy Carpenter also had an excellent quarter. Underlying revenue growth was strong, increasing 10%. Conditions in the reinsurance market improved slightly this quarter, but the real story for Carpenter was increased new business, which we have seen for the last three quarters. In fact, new business production this quarter was the highest level Carpenter has had in over five years. Additionally Peter and his team have continued the cost reduction measures begun in the second quarter of 2008. As a result of the strong revenue growth and cost reduction, Guy Carpenter saw a dramatic increase in profitability. In April we completed the acquisition of Collins Associates, formerly the fifth largest reinsurance intermediary in the United States and seventh largest in the world. I’m pleased to report the integration is going extremely well. Turning to our consulting segment, Mercer’s performance in the first quarter was encouraging. The two largest consulting practices, Retirement and Health and Benefits, both saw revenue performance improve. Retirement grew 2% in the first quarter on an underlying basis and Health and Benefits grew 4%. As you would expect, the decline in discretionary projects due to the recession impacted Mercer’s other consulting practices, especially human capital. When you look at adjusted revenue for Mercer’s consulting business overall, it was unchanged from the first quarter of last year. We view this as a solid performance in the current economic environment.  Mercer’s management kept pace with the changing operating environment over the past year. Michele and her team acted quickly to establish cost containment measures and as a result, expenses declined in the quarter by 1% on an underlying basis. So Mercer’s profitability decline was mainly due to foreign currency translation into a stronger dollar.  Oliver Wyman continues to face the most difficult operating environment it has seen in many years. John and his team are reducing consultant capacity and many discretionary expense items while striving to maintain strong market positions in their areas of expertise. Headcount was reduced in the first quarter and it will continue to fall in the second quarter as a result of actions taken in April. These actions are in addition to the expense initiatives taken, since the middle of 2008. In this environment tough decisions have to be made and executed effectively, this is being done. We look for a sequential improvement in profitability in the second quarter from the first quarter. Now turning to Kroll, the economic climate is also affecting Kroll’s cyclical businesses such as employment screening. Kroll’s non-cyclical businesses remain stable. Ben and his team are continuing to take out costs, which Vanessa will cover in her remarks.  Throughout MMC, we have made substantial progress over the last year despite one of the most challenging operating environments in decades and I should point out that our major operating companies are well built. We continue to implement plans that will position our operating companies for the longer term. We are improving our operational characteristics, our systems, client service platforms and achieving operational efficiencies. These actions will position us to accomplish more than just weathering the storm. We are laying the foundation and building an organization that will emerge as a global growth company. We are extremely confident about the long-term prospects of MMC. Now let’s turn it over to Vanessa to present our financial results for the quarter. Vanessa. 
Vanessa Wittman: Thank you, Brian and good morning everyone. As Brian mentioned, I’ll walk you through a number of hurdles that MMC faced in the first quarter of 2009; then I’ll cover our operating results. Our adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.40. There were a number of items that negatively impacted MMC’s EPS in the first quarter. These items totaled $0.15 and included the following. Foreign currency translation reduced EPS by $0.05. Lower corporate interest income reduced EPS by $0.01, while the decline in fiduciary interest income from $40 million in the first quarter of 2008 to $15 million in the first quarter of 2009, decreased EPS by an additional $0.03. A swing in investment income impacted EPS by $0.03. There are two additional items that investors could not have calculated. First, in response to IRS regulation 409A involving deferred compensation, MMC modified vesting conditions of deferred bonus awards for retirement eligible employees. This resulted in accelerated amortization in the quarter of $17 million or $0.02 per share. Secondly, MMC was required to adapt the FASB pronouncement pertaining to the calculation of EPS using the dual class method. This method reduced EPS in the first quarter by $0.01. These two items totaled $0.03 a share and although they did impact the quarter, they have no long-term impact on earnings, were it not for these last two items, we would have met the first call estimate of $0.43 for the quarter. Now I’d like to move to the financial performance of our operating companies. As I’ve done previously, all my references to growth rates will be underlying revenue and adjusted operating income. Let me start with Risk and Insurance Services. Total segment revenue, which includes fiduciary interest income, was $1.4 billion. Excluding the decline in fiduciary interest income, segment revenue increased 1%. More importantly, segment profitability increased 30% to $343 million from $264 million. Marsh’s revenue declined 1% reflecting reduced general insurance activity as a result of the global economic downturn. International operations, which were about 60% of Marsh’s revenue in the first quarter was strong, up 4% in aggregate. Latin America increased 15%, Asia Pacific was up 9%, and EMEA rose 2%. Ongoing expense reduction initiatives drove Marsh’s operating expenses down 8% in the first quarter, resulting in strong growth and operating income. Moving to reinsurance broking, Guy Carpenter also had an excellent quarter. Revenue increased 10% in the first quarter, its strongest performance in several years. For the third consecutive quarter, Guy Carpenter generated strong new business, a testament to the approach taken by Peter and his team a year ago to reshape operations. At the same time, expense controls implemented over the past four quarters continued to be effective. Operating expenses decreased 7%. The resulting growth in Guy Carpenter’s profitability was impressive. Turning to our Consulting segment, Mercer’s performance in the first quarter was encouraging. Consulting revenue for Mercer was flat. The decrease in outsourcing revenue was primarily due to the sharp declines in the securities markets affecting revenues tied to assets under administration by $12 million. Demand remains strong for our investment consulting and management services, which generated revenue growth of 6%. On the cost side, Michele and her team have done an excellent job dealing with the recent market conditions. They reacted swiftly and as a result, operating expenses decreased by 1% on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter. Looking at profitability, Mercer was significantly affected by foreign currency translation. The strengthening of the dollar against currencies, such as the pounds, the euro and the Canadian dollar negatively affected Mercer’s operating income by $26 million in the first quarter; excluding the effects of foreign exchange and the accelerate expenses due to IRS 409(A) discussed earlier, Mercer’s operating income was flat with last year. We view this as solid performance. At Oliver Wyman, first quarter revenue of $280 million decreased 19% from last year’s first quarter. Expense reductions were implemented that resulted in a 9% decrease in operating expenses in the quarter. This substantial expense reduction was achieved despite the fact that first quarter operating expenses included $10 million in severance for capacity related staff reductions and $8 million of 409(A) accelerated amortization. Now let me take a minute to explain, how we differentiate between restructuring charges that we add back to operating income to arrive at our non-GAAP measures versus severance charges that we consider operational. If there is a reduction related to a permanent or fundamental change in our business operations, we identify these costs in our non-GAAP schedules. These fundamental changes could include business reorganization, a departure from a business line or geographic area or an integration due to an acquisition. If, however, we reduce staffing capacity as a response to a temporary reduction in business activity resulting from economic conditions, the severance costs are included in our operating expenses, not in our non-GAAP schedules. In the first quarter of 2009, there were capacity reductions at both Oliver Wyman and at Kroll. The severance costs associated with these reductions are included in our operating expenses since capacity will be reestablished when demand increases. Turning back to Oliver Wyman, capacity reduction actions already taken will result in a decline in headcount in the second quarter, along with additional severance costs of approximately $8 million. So as Brian noted, we expect that Oliver Wyman will deliver an improvements in profitability in the second quarter from the first quarter since we will not have accelerate amortization from 409(A) and we will begin to see the benefits of the capacity reductions done in the first quarter. Now moving to Risk Consulting and Technology; Kroll had revenue of a $187 million in the first quarter down 8%. Results include $5 million of operating expenses for capacity related headcount reductions in the quarter. Looking ahead, we also expect a sequential improvement in Kroll’s profitability in the second quarter. Moving onto investment income, with the decline in the securities within the private equity portfolio, we anticipate an investment loss in the second quarter that could approach $30 million. Turning to our capital structure, our liquidity and cash positions remain strong. As you know, our cash utilization is typically greatest in the first quarter primarily due to the funding of incentive compensation payments. Our cash generation typically accelerates in the second half of the year. We ended the first quarter with $1.4 billion of cash. In March we issued $400 million of 10-year senior notes to refinance our $400 million of senior debt due in June. We saw high investor demand for these notes, which was very encouraging and a strong indication of our financial flexibility. Our next bond maturity is not until September 2010 and it’s $550 million. MMC has no outstanding commercial paper or bank loans. We continue to maintain a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility that remains un-drawn. With that, let me turn it back to Brian.
Brian Duperreault: Thanks Vanessa. Okay, Jake I think we can take some questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Keith Walsh - Citi.
Keith Walsh - Citi: I guess just for Dan, to start with, just North America, if you give some color there, the minus 8% looking at some of your competitors at least in the U.S. minus 5% was sort of the standard. What was the real downfall there if you can give us some more color? Thanks.
Dan Glaser : Well, most of the U.S. and Canada top-line result was driven by difficult economic conditions, particularly in the U.S. We are seeing clients delay decisions, cut back discretionary work and purchase less insurance in certain instances. All of which are affecting our revenue retention in new business. Now there’s a few important things to point out. At least a point of the reduction was due to the fact that we simply walked away from small under-priced consulting engagements for clients. We also estimate that we lost a couple of points due to timing of certain large renewals. I expect to get that back later in the year, so those two factors explains about half of the drop. 
Keith Walsh - Citi: Then the second thing; follow up question just on margin, Dan. Great margin this quarter, but I guess, you’re creating tougher comps as we go out, which I guess is a good problem to have, but excluding the non-core headwinds like FX and interest income, are there additional underlying improvements as we go out into 2010 that you can still get-to, to get that margin to continue to increase at Marsh? Thanks. 
Dan Glaser : Well, the answer is absolutely. I have absolutely no doubt that we have a great deal of work still to accomplish within Marsh and we will continue to deliver margin improvement. We drove down our underlying expenses last year by 6% and as you can see in the first quarter our underlying expenses were down 8%. I don’t expect the 8% to continue for the entire year, but we will see meaningful reductions in our expenses and just to give you one thought, if I exclude compensation and benefits; our expenses were actually down 11% in the first quarter. So, we are finding lots of areas of real estate, technology, facilities, T&E where we are eliminating waste and we are continuing to be able to find items which we can drive out of the business. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: I was a little bit surprised that your expectation for the second quarter investment results for the loss of $30 million, just given the market and what I perceive as some of the whole things in that. I wonder, if you could explain that? Secondly, if you could maybe just talk about what Collins adds to the Guy Carpenter franchise?
Brian Duperreault: Well, let’s let Vanessa do the $30 million and Peter can do the Collins. Go ahead, Vanessa.
Vanessa Wittman: Sure. In the $30 million of investment income, Larry we have a significant portion of public market securities that are managed by Stone Point. So, the guidance we’re giving on the $30 million is really related to us reporting those on a lag. So, we have a significant amount of information going into that guidance as to the results from Q1 of Axis and Nstar.
Brian Duperreault: Peter, why don’t you talk about Collins?
Peter Zaffino: Certainly, Collins, a wonderful organization; we felt it was a very strong strategic fit for us for several reasons. One is, they had a market leading medical malpractice portfolio, very strong in the agricultural and crop area. So, it really complemented our portfolio quite well. Strong in regional business and they had a very strong presence in Florida, a great sales culture and combining that with Guy Carpenter gave us opportunities. We think to leverage further growth in the United States in 2009 and beyond.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: So just following up, was Florida really a big part of that and maybe capitalizing on some of the dislocations that could be going on down there?
Peter Zaffino: They had a strong presence in Florida, Larry, but that was not a key driver. It was something that complemented the core reasons, why we wanted to do the acquisition, but really medical malpractice, the agricultural business and the regional business are the biggest strengths for Collins, but they did have a presence in Florida that was a nice addition to what we had currently.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Meredith - UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Just a couple of quick numbers questions here. First, Vanessa, what’s the tax rate going to look like? Is that going to go back down to 31%?
Vanessa Wittman: It will bounce around quarter-to-quarter, Brian as we move through the year, but guidance between 29% and 31% for the year would be appropriate.  
Brian Meredith - UBS: The FX drag going forward, could it probably be an issue in the second quarter?
Vanessa Wittman: The second and third quarter particularly, for Mercer.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Back on Larry’s Collins question, any way to give us a sense of what the actual revenue that Collins generated in maybe 2008 looks like, so we can kind of factor it into our models?
Peter Zaffino: The 2008 revenue for Collins was around $69 million.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Then last question, what about M&A opportunities, particularly in the agency business that you are looking at, what does that look like right now? Have you done many quarter-to-date or year-to-date?
Brian Duperreault: Dan, do you want to take the agency?
Dan Glaser: Yes. We haven’t closed on any transactions in the agency in the quarter. The focus in the near term is on acquisitions and we’re in the prospecting mode. So, we’re very excited about what we’re seeing. There is a lot of quality firms in the small and middle market space. So, we have a very active pipeline. We expect to be active in the acquisition market, but our timing is more related to when there is a good fit and when the prices are right and when we think that mutually working with an agent that we can grow the business profitably together. So, we don’t feel compelled to do transactions, but we would expect that we will do some this year and certainly every year thereafter.
Brian Meredith - UBS: So, the weak economy is not causing prices to comedown?
Dan Glaser: I think the weak economy is one factor, which is impacting an agency’s EBIT. So, the question is, “Are multiples coming down or not?” I think, what you tend to find is multiples on high quality businesses probably are under less pressure, maybe a little bit of downward pressure, but it is really some drop in the actual earnings of firms based upon what the economy is doing.
Operator: Your next question comes from Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan: With Guy Carpenter, can you just give us a little bit of color with respect to the new business and how much of this is kind of net new versus what you would maybe perceive as share?
Peter Zaffino: Sure, certainly. 
Brian Duperreault: I know Peter would love to answer this. 
Peter Zaffino: As Brian and Vanessa said, we had a really strong quarter in new business growth. Overall, we saw about 35% increase year-over-year from first quarter 2008 to first quarter 2009. Around 80% of that was expanding through current clients, creating different solutions around capital, perhaps expanding catastrophe placements and 20% came from brand new clients that we didn’t have prior to this year.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan: How does that 20% compared, is that a kind of a normal ratio? 
Peter Zaffino: It is. I’d say usually it’s in the 10% to 15% range. So, we slightly exceeded expectations for Guy Carpenter in the first quarter, but it’s in the range of expectation for the first quarter of any calendar year. 
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan: Then just with respect to the margins in Risk and Insurance, I was curious if you could just talk about on a year-over-year basis the margin improvement, what Guy Carpenter’s contribution to that was just order of magnitude? 
Vanessa Wittman: We actually don’t split the contribution out for you on the margins.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan: Well, would you be willing to give us what, I can’t remember if maybe you gave this already, but the underlying decline in expenses in that segment then? 
Vanessa Wittman: We can’t give you any further information, sorry. 
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan: Then just one for Dan; you mentioned in your comments some of the things that were affecting, but could you just speak more specifically to what’s happening, what clients are doing with respect to exposures and is there any price elasticity offsetting that or are we basically, is that just running through in full force? 
Dan Glaser: Well, I think there is wide variety of factors. So, I wouldn’t say this there is only one factor impacting us and impacting the economy. I mean, obviously a deep recession is causing lower exposures. We are seeing rate competition amongst insurers. There is more marketing activity on existing accounts, particularly since certain insurance companies had their own issues over the course of the last six months. So, a lot of clients are going to the market. So we are doing a lot more work on existing accounts to market them and explore alternatives, not necessarily to move the accounts, but actually to give our clients alternatives and we are seeing less new business. So, I’d call it in the vernacular, we are in a hunkering down phase, a lot of our clients are just deciding to push-off some of the discretionary kind of things that they have done in the past, either on a limit basis or a retention basis. So, we have seen clients make decisions about what their overall premium level is that they want to spend and sort of retrofit their program into a premium level and that’s pretty unusual. 
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan: Could you give us a guesstimate of what you think budgets are down for kind of the Fortune 500 or Fortune 1000 buyer? 
Dan Glaser: Well, I think on a broad sense you usually find insurance being very close mirroring GDP in mature economies and so, if you would use any measure, I would use that one. I mean, but when you look at us who have the leading market share in the Fortune 1000 space, there’s an awful lot of different industries that are captured within that and I would think the factors for individual industries would be very different.
Vanessa Wittman: Matthew, just to follow up, I don’t want to split out the margins for you, but we did talk about the expense reductions at both Marsh, which were down 8% and at Guy Carpenter, which were down 7% and that may help you get.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan: Yes, and that 7%, that’s excluding the impact of Collins, right?
Vanessa Wittman: Right, we didn’t close Collins until April. So, that will be a 2Q event.
Operator: Your next question comes from Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus: I guess within the reinsurance, the new business that you are seeing, is that from larger competitors that are distracted, smaller competitors with less resources or just a tendency to buy more reinsurance?
Brian Duperreault: I will start with talking about geography. We’ve seen 50% of our new business come from U.K. and continental Europe and 50% come from our Americas region. We changed last year, our new business philosophy in terms of how we structured the organization and had several, if not five to 10 very Senior Executives within Guy Carpenter shift their focus to exclusively sales. So, there is really no specific type of client that we’ve been more successful with than others. We shifted our focus around capital and capital management to help the discretionary spend about reinsurance, be a little bit more insightful in terms of how we’re looking at contingent capital. We have had a lot of success there. As I mentioned earlier, 80% or so has come from current clients and that’s been expansion new opportunities through increases in catastrophe or just reinsurance they haven’t purchased in the past. Expect to see, as we look forward, the same type of solutions that we’re going to drive to clients around the world and expect to see the new business continue that trend.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus: I guess primary insurance brokerage; I think Dan talked a little bit about a new business model. I guess two questions for that. How long will that be affecting revenues and were there any expenses that were deferred related to the two point hit from timing?
Dan Glaser: A couple of things; one, we have developed a new business model in the United States, and it is geared toward client segmentation and also placement hubs. I’m very happy to say, in the first quarter, more than 80% of the submissions that we handled went through our placement hubs and it was in the mid to upper 80s in terms of premium volume were handled in our hubs. So, we are in the process of implementing that right now. I don’t believe that the implementation of the model is having an impact on revenue. If you ask, “Whether there is any distraction?” I would say there may be, but that’s a very short term issue and our client retention levels are as high as they’ve been even in the heydays of the 1990s. So, our actions in our model are not impairing our service or impacting our client retention levels. My overall feeling about distraction in general, while it maybe a human trait. I also think it’s a sign of weakness and so I would not expect that to sustain. Our organization is strong and resilient and will bounce back. So an easy answer would be, I don’t expect to run at minus eight in the U.S. and Canada for the balance of the year.
Brian Duperreault: There were no expense deferrals.
Operator: Your next question comes from Thomas Mitchell - Miller Tabak.
Thomas Mitchell - Miller Tabak: I have a sort of double barreled question about outlook for the corporate strategy. When we talk about acquisitions, as you’ve had a question about it, we note that your own stock price, when we include the Consulting business represents close to or less than your expected revenues per share, which means that possibly Marsh & McLennan itself might be attractive for acquisition or your stock might be attractive for investments compared with other insurance brokerage businesses? Secondly, previous management at Marsh Mac was eager to talk about, how important it was to cross-sell and come up with different ways to make the single enterprise, including the Consulting businesses and the insurance brokerage businesses, all in one single large entity, but perhaps it might make more sense, not to be in the Consulting business longer term. So I’m wondering, what your views are on both aspects of your corporate structure, let’s say, five years from now?
Brian Duperreault: Thomas, I guess I have to take that question. Everybody says you get that one. Well, let’s take the acquisition approach. When we referring to it, one was the agency space, which we think is very strategic for Marsh. It is an area in the brokerage world, which we have not done very much in. It’s a very large, very big space and companies do very well in it and there is really no reason why we shouldn’t. So, strategically, I think it’s been a miss for us and we need to fix that. So, our approach to acquisitions really revolves around improving the strategic position of the operating companies and we are going to continue to do that. There is no reason why we wouldn’t. Collins was a terrific addition to Guy Carpenter. So, I don’t think there’s really much more to say about acquisitions except that we feel that this year is a great year to make acquisitions. Any year is a good year, there’s always pluses and minuses. Value is a little better, people are a little more interested and we are going to take advantage of it. Now in terms of the whole structure of the company and this issue of cross-sell; now obviously one would want to have opportunities that emerge between operating companies, maximize push to taken advantage of who wouldn’t, but this year; this past year, the last 15 months or so. We’ve really been spending on getting each of the operating companies into good condition, better condition than they were, better managed, better expensed, a better sales culture and that’s been the primary thrust. Now, we at the same time always look at opportunities to cross-sell, but that’s not driving motivation for us and it isn’t the overall corporate sale. We are collection of some very, very good companies, all of them excellent in their space and collectively, we think we have the most interesting collection of advice one can get globally. It runs through the whole risks gamut from physical risk to HR risk to strategic risk to information risk and I think that is really what we provide to our clients. That is our brand and that’s what we are going to push. Now I’m not going to speculate on what this company looks like five years from now, but it’s going to continue to grow.
Operator: Your next question comes from Keith Walsh - Citi.
Keith Walsh - Citi: Just a couple of things first, what was your the FX impact on your brokerage margin this quarter? Then I’ve got a follow up for Michele or John.
Vanessa Wittman: Sure, the FX impact overall was $0.05 or $40 million and that split roughly $32 million to the consulting segment, $26 million to Mercer and then the remaining $8 million would have been in the Risk and Insurance Services segment.
Keith Walsh - Citi: Then just regarding consulting, I mean we’ve seen over history of the limited data we’ve got revenues rarely go negative before this quarter and margins rarely go below 10, but we haven’t seen unemployment of 10% within those that data set. Maybe if you can just give us some idea about sensitivity around, we get to 10% unemployment, what really happens to revenues at your company and basically give us a little more color about how you are going to restore margins with these expense saves back towards that 10% level? Thanks.
Brian Duperreault: Well, I think really both of Michele and John have to answer that question separately. So, Michele, you want to start?
Michele Burns: Yes, I think that’s an interesting question. If you look at Mercer, if you take Mercer apart just for a second, in the quarter and quite frankly as we think about the future, over the next couple of quarters; we see a challenged revenue environment, but against that challenged revenue environment, Mercer across its pillars is holding its own. I would call out that in some lines that are more directly comparable to our competitors, we are actually growing at or above where we are after two years of very solid growth in that first quarter. So we are lapping both, I believe its 8% and 9% growth in Q1 ‘07, Q1 ‘08. So the idea that Mercer has come along today in that kind of shape feels pretty good and at the same time of holding onto our margin, holding onto our profitability. Now, take us up another few percentage points of unemployment, allow the recession to deepen. We would continue undoubtedly to see the weakness that we see today in our project based businesses, our human capital business, our communications business, for example. They are more material to Mercer than they are to our competitors because our business mix is just different. We would see the other drags that have happened in those environments because you would be inferring that some businesses may fail. So, you’d see some additional issues, and certainly we would have to take even more aggressive expense actions, but we’ve tried to build ourselves in such a way. We are ready for that and ready to move both ways depending on what happens here. I think we are seeing some sense of consolidation and I’m quite frankly, when I look across our strong core businesses, quite frankly, pleased at 2% and 4% and retirement at HNB, especially after such strong growth years in both those areas. I’m not as pessimistic perhaps as we could have been at some earlier time about how long this might last. So to summarize for Mercer, I think at this stage we feel pretty well built for this and pretty flexible in terms of how we could respond reasonably quickly to the extent that predictions turnout to be a bit worse than we might expect today. I’ll have John also answer because I think it is a different enough scenario that he needs to express it himself.
John Drzik: So, Oliver Wyman’s business is clearly sensitive to the economic environment and we’re projecting a continuation of the tough environment for the next several quarters and have made our capacity and expense decisions based on that outlook. So roughly speaking, we’re projecting sequential revenue sort of stable revenues quarter-to-quarter through the year, but we should see a profitability increase through the course of the year for three reasons. One is, starting in the second quarter, we’ll start to see the benefits of the capacity decisions we took in the first quarter of this year and those will continue through the year. Second, we won’t have the 409(A) adjustment on deferred comp that we had in the first quarter that was a onetime effect. Finally, after Q1 and Q2, our severance costs will drop off, which was obviously significantly increased in that period because of the actions we’re taking. So, we are sensitive to the environment. If it gets worse or better, we’ll have to make continued adjustments, but we aren’t expecting a immediate recovery and expecting a relatively prolonged continuation of this type of revenue environment.
Operator: Your final question comes from Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus: I was hoping to get some guidance as to the seasonality of Collins revenues and expenses?
Brian Duperreault: Collins seasonality, Peter.
Peter Zaffino: It’s going to be very consistent with, I believe, how our revenue gets recognized. Again, as Vanessa said, it didn’t close till the second quarter. We have approximately one-third of our revenue come through in the first quarter and then it’s around 22% in the second and third and then 20% plus in the fourth quarter. I think their revenues are going to be fairly consistent. They may have a little bit more based on Florida and some of the Ag book in the second quarter. So when we look at it, depending on how we’re successful in Florida, we may have a little bit of an uplift in the second quarter relative to how our revenue earns out at Guy Carpenter, but it should be fairly consistent.
Brian Duperreault: I think we got time for maybe one more question.
Operator: At this time, there is no additional question.
Brian Duperreault: Well, let me close it up and I just would like to express my appreciation to all our employees across the company. It has been an extraordinary period in our lives and I’m really in proud of what you’ve done to really help our clients and this company and our shareholders. So, let’s all get back to work. Thanks.
Operator: With that, that does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Executives: Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer of MMC Vanessa A. Wittman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of MMC Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh Peter Zaffino - President and Chief Executive Officer of Guy Carpenter M. Michele Burns - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mercer
Analysts: Keith Walsh - Citigroup Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to MMC's Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2008 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on MMC's website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. In particular, references during this conference call to anticipated or expected results of operations for 2009 or subsequent periods are forward-looking statements and MMC's actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. Please refer to MMC's most recent SEC filing as well as the company's earnings release, which are available on the MMC website for additional information on factors that could actual... that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC.
Brian Duperreault: Good morning and thank you for joining us, to discuss our year-end results reported earlier today. I am Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me and presenting on the call today is Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. I would also like to welcome our operating company's CEOs to today's call, Dan Glaser of Marsh; Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter; Michele Burns of Mercer; John Drzik of Oliver Wyman; and Ben Allen of Kroll. Also with us is Mike Bischoff our Head of Investor Relations. After I make some brief remarks, Vanessa will present our financial results and then we will take your questions. I am pleased to report we had a strong fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS of $0.37 represented an increase of more than 50% over the $0.24 we reported in the fourth quarter of last year. This was achieved despite several factors, including significantly lower interest rates that reduced corporate and fiduciary interest income. The impact of foreign exchange on Mercer's operating income, which is greater than it has been historically in an economic climate that weighed heavily on our consulting businesses. In the quarter, we saw a very strong improvement, primarily in Risk and Insurance Services segment. As a result adjusted operating income was $279 million, an increase of 30% from the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income was $1.2 billion, an increase of 24% from the $1 billion reported in 2007. Adjusted EPS grew 9% to $1.45 from $1.33. We achieved these results even though we experienced a significant year-over-year decline in investment income, reducing EPS by $0.23. Now a few words about each of our businesses: Marsh turned in an impressive performance, not only in the quarter but for the entire year. It is clear that Dan and his team are successfully executing their turnaround plan and it is gratifying that they exceeded their goals for the year. Marsh produced 3% underlying revenue growth for the quarter. Client revenue retention increased in the quarter, continuing a trend seen over the past nine months. In fact, for the year, Marsh's client revenue retention rate exceeded prior year by 3 percentage points. New business production also remained strong exceeding $900 million for the year. The main driver of Marsh's improved profitability was expense reduction. Not only for the quarter but for the entire year, Marsh's expenses were down versus 2007. As a result, even as the soft insurance cycle persisted, Marsh was able to show a significant improvement in profitability and margins. Looking at the year, I'm extremely pleased to report that Marsh had a 570-basis point margin improvement, surpassing even our own expectations. It is a fantastic start to a multiyear process. Then I started down the path of implementing the second phase of operational improvements and major initiatives to enhance client service and to position Marsh for a continued growth in margin expansion. This includes client's segmentation, the creation of placement hubs, the launch of Marsh & McLennan agency for the small emerging growth sector, and exploring potential M&A opportunities. At Guy Carpenter, profitability improved over the last three quarters. Just a recap; the first quarter saw a meaningful decline in profitability, which prompted a change in management and led to Carpenter's restructuring program. In the second quarter, there was a modest decline in profitability. And in the third quarter, profitability was maintained at prior-year level, as a result... as the full effects of expense savings were realized. In the fourth quarter, despite continued competitive insurance market conditions, profitability improved dramatically due to these expense savings. For the entire year, profitability was essentially maintained in a difficult environment. This impressive turnaround is a credit to Peter and his team. For the Risk and Insurance Services segment, even with fiduciary interest income declining substantially, adjusted operating income for the full year increased 58% to $729 million from $462 million, with margin improvement of 470 basis points. These results were achieved in the soft insurance cycle that characterized 2008. As you know however, we've seen dramatic events occur in the past six months. A question that remains is how will the events occurring today, affect market conditions in 2009 versus 2008? Personally, I believe the market will harden (ph). We've already seen that occurring in reinsurance, particularly in the property segment. We're yet see it meaningfully in the primary market. However, it is clear that the severity of the current economic downturn may substantially dampen the effect of rate increases leading to something I'm calling it invisible hard market. For us at MMC, 2009 remains a year devoted to margin improvement through better expense management, creation of efficiencies and improved processes. It will not be a year in which we expect a dramatic impact from a hard market per se. Irrespective of external forces however, we have laid a good foundation for our Insurance Services business in 2008, and so you see... continue that momentum this year. Moving on to our Consulting businesses; Mercer's underlying revenue growth in the quarter was flat. Retirement, Mercer's largest business, saw a near-term decline in client project activity. Currently, client demand remains solid and we expect us to achieve low single-digit growth in the Retirement business in 2009. A 6% decline in outsourcing in the quarter was a direct result of lower equity markets, since a portion of outsourcing fees is tied to assets under administration. On the positive side, we reported growth of 3% in Mercer's Health and Benefits business, 3% growth in other consulting lines, and total Mercer Consulting increased 1%. Investment Consulting & Management grew 7%. As early as last spring, Michele and her team had anticipated a slowdown in client demand due to changing economic conditions. They reviewed areas in which they could potentially cut spending, which allowed them to move quickly to reduce expenses when they saw a weakness developing last fall. During the quarter... during the fourth quarter, Mercer reduced its headcount by 400 and as a result of management's planning and foresight, limited growth in adjusted operating expenses on an underlying basis to 1%. For 2008, Mercer had an excellent year overall, with underlying revenue growth of 7%, and strong results across all lines of business. Growth and profitability was also strong. In the quarter, Oliver Wyman's business saw a continued weak demand for projects particularly, in the United States market. As a result, John and his team implemented a series of prudent cost savings initiatives. In January, they initiated a multi-sector, multi-geography reduction in headcount of approximately 6% of total staff. Capacity is now more closely aligned with projected demand. But John and his team will continue to react to economic conditions as the year progresses. Turning to Risk Consulting and Technology; Kroll had a difficult quarter due primarily to the impact of economic conditions on the Employment and Mortgage Screening businesses, as well as M&A-related consulting. Kroll's Litigation and Data Recovery business saw reduced volumes in the fourth quarter, as clients sought to delay litigation costs. We believe this is an anomaly since litigation has not historically been sensitive to economic conditions. Due to the economic environment, Kroll implemented cost containment measures, including capacity-related headcount reductions. These are actions resulted in a 3% reduction in adjusted expenses on an underlying basis. However, profitability for Kroll declined in the quarter, as the benefit of the headcount reductions was not fully realized. Kroll completed some additional expense reductions in the early part of this quarter. For 2008, Kroll reported revenue growth of 6%, with underlying revenue growth of 2% and an improvement in adjusted operating income of 7%. In separate transactions at the end of last year, we sold our U.S. and UK restructuring businesses to their senior executives in leveraged management buyouts. Vanessa will provide additional details. In closing, let me say that, when I became CEO a year ago, there were several goals I wanted to achieve. And I think 2008 has been a year of great progress. Marsh was returned to profitable growth with a significant improvement in its operating results. Guy Carpenter and its new management team successfully implemented a major restructuring, increased new business development and improved profitability over the last three quarters. It is well positioned to grow going into 2009. Kroll also had a change in senior management and undertook a major redefinition of its business, gave greater attention to expense control and divested a business that clearly did not fit with its future plans. And Mercer and Oliver Wyman managed well through a difficult economic environment. While I am pleased with the progress we've made so far, I have always said that restoring MMC to its pre-eminent position is a multiyear process. Certainly, we will manage the company prudently in the face of the current uncertainty in both the financial markets and the global economy. Even in the current environment, we believe we can deliver profitable growth in 2009. We think our Risk and Insurance Services segment will see continued improvement in its profitability. While Mercer saw some weakness in the fourth quarter, we think it will show positive growth in 2009. And Oliver Wyman and Kroll, which are more subject to market forces in other parts of MMC, will continue to monitor the environment and weather the storm. While no one expects this year to be easy, we are confident that MMC with its diverse mix of professional services will be highly valued by our clients. Now let me turn it over to Vanessa to present our financial results for the quarter.
Vanessa A. Wittman: Thanks very much Brian and good morning everyone. This morning I'd like to cover several topics: operating results, investment income, pensions and liquidity. Given the unusual combination of interest rate declines, equity market declines and foreign exchange rate volatility, I'll try to highlight the impact of these factors on the segment results as I describe the quarter. Let's turn to our operating results. EPS from continuing operations was $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2008. Noteworthy items in the quarter as described in our supplemental schedules were $0.23 a share. This takes us to adjusted EPS of $0.37, an increase of 54% from $0.24 in last year's fourth quarter. As I discussed, each operating company's progress for the quarter, all the references to growth rates will be underlying revenue growth and operating income on an adjusted basis. Let me start with Marsh. For the fourth quarter, while Marsh grew revenue up 3%, expense reduction and cost discipline drove operating expenses down 6%. Marsh's client revenue retention rate continued to improve in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the increase was 2 percentage points and for the full year, the rate improved 3 percentage points, reaching its highest level in the past five years. For the full year 2008, Marsh's restructuring activities reduced staff by about 2200 people, including 700 positions that were outsourced. Restructuring and related charges in 2008 were approximately $180 million, with anticipated annualized savings totaling $200 million. This includes savings of $75 million that were realized in 2008. In addition to these restructuring efforts, across the board reductions in travel and entertainment, marketing and advertising, information technology and outside consulting fees enabled Marsh to improve its operating margin for the year by 570 basis points. As we look forward, we expect Marsh's operating margins to continue to rise in 2009, though not at the magnitude of the increase that was achieved in 2008. Now, let's look at Guy Carpenter. Revenue decreased 2% in the fourth quarter, a solid improvement from the first nine months of 2008. We are pleased that Carpenter generated strong new business in both the third and fourth quarters. We saw a continued evidence of this increased new business activity in the important January renewal period. Over the last three quarters, Peter and his team were able to improve Carpenter's profitability despite a very difficult environment. They implemented a series of cost containment measures that resulted in an 8% decline in operating expenses in 2008. Before we leave the Risk and Insurance Services segment, I want to talk about the impact of interest rate declines on the segment. As seen in the supplemental schedules included in our press release, we now segregate fiduciary interest income from the revenue of Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Prior periods have been reclassified to be consistent with the fourth quarter presentation. A substantial decline in short-term interest rates compared with fourth quarter of 2007, reduced fiduciary interest income from $40 million to $25 million in the fourth quarter. For the year, fiduciary interest income fell from a $177 million in 2007 to $139 million in 2008. We expect short-term interest rates will continue to act as a significant hurdle to interest income earned on fiduciary funds. But, we expect both Marsh and Guy Carpenter to more than overcome this hurdle with their operating performance. Turning to our Consulting segment, let's start with Mercer. For the year, Mercer had strong revenue growth of 7% with growth in all businesses. Its consulting practice increased 7%, outsourcing was up 4%, and investment consulting and management grew 16%. Mercer maintained its margin while increasing operating income by 7%. In the fourth quarter, Mercer's consulting practices had revenue growth of 1%, as a slight decline in retirement was more than offset by 3% gains in both health and benefits, and human capital. Outsourcing was down 6%. The sharp declines in the equity markets impacted their results in the fourth quarter, as 25% of Mercer's outsourcing revenue is tied to assets under administration. Investment Consulting and Management rose 7% for the fourth quarter. As Brain mentioned, in anticipation of a potential economic slowdown, Mercer began the process to reduce costs, and gain efficiencies in the spring of 2008. As a result, in the fourth quarter, Mercer eliminated approximately 400 positions at a cost of $39 million, with anticipated expense savings of about $45 million. As mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, Mercer's results were negatively affected by the strengthening of the dollar. This continued through the fourth quarter. As an example, in the fourth quarter, the British pound averaged a decline of 23% against the dollar on a year-over-year basis. In January, the pound sank to its lowest value against the dollar in nearly a quarter century, before strengthening somewhat in the last couple of weeks. If January foreign exchange rates for the U.S. dollar held for the entire year against currencies such as the pounds, the euro, and the Canadian dollar, Mercer's 2009 operating income could be negatively affected by 60 to $80 million. At Oliver Wyman, fourth quarter revenue of $392 million reflected a decrease of 10%. This was primarily due to approximately $30 million in success fees in the fourth quarter of 2007, which were not replicated in 2008. Excluding the impact of success fees, the decrease in revenue would have been 4%. Oliver Wyman implemented expense reductions that resulted in a 4% decrease in operating expenses in the quarter. With extremely challenging conditions persisting, Oliver Wyman is continuing to reduce expenses, while protecting its long-term franchise value. As Brian mentioned, selective headcount reductions better aligned staff levels with anticipated demand. Now turning to Risk Consulting and Technology; Kroll had revenue of a $188 million in the fourth quarter, a decline of 8%. Growth of 4% in risk mitigation and response was offset by declines of litigation support and background screening. At the end of 2008, we completed the divestiture of three separate restructuring businesses, one in the U.S., and two in the UK, each with a unique deal structure. We are unable to treat these businesses as discontinued operations, since MMC will continue to have a financial interest through revenue sharing arrangements and seller financing. As a result, we recognized a $28 million charge in the disposal of the UK businesses, even though much of this may be recovered through future royalty payments. We also deferred an $18 million gain on the disposal of the U.S. businesses. Moving on, MMC's investment income was $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with $10 million in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to mark-to-market gains in investments within our private equity portfolio, which is reported to MMC on a one-quarter lag basis. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2009, with the decline in the publicly-traded securities within the private equity portfolio, we expect an investment loss of at least $20 million. Now, let me bring you up to-date on pensions. Our defined benefit pension plans were clearly affected by the severe downturn in the global equity markets in 2008. Our defined benefit assets declined over 20% in the U.S. to $2.8 billion and in the U.K our largest plan by approximately 15% to £2.7 billion. For GAAP purposes, pension liabilities are largely dependent on the discount rate set as of year-end. In the U.S., interest rates declined dramatically by year-end driving the year-end discount rate lower. This contributed to a $300 million increase in the projected benefit obligation. While our U.S. plan show a funding deficit as of year end, no contributions to the U.S. plan are required in 2009. Due to an increase in the discount rate and a reduction in inflation expectations, our U.K plan liabilities decreased slightly in 2008. Although we made scheduled contributions to the UK plan throughout the year, in January of 2009, we made a discretionary pension contribution of £50 million or $70 million. We expect to contribute a similar amount in the second quarter. Overall, MMC's aggregate pension expense in 2009 will be similar to that of 2008. Looking at our capital structure, our liquidity and cash positions remain strong. Despite the meaningful restructuring activities in 2008 for Marsh, Guy Carpenter, Mercer and Corporate debt reduction of $250 million and the final $170 million payments to the New York Attorney General, we ended the year with $1.7 billion of cash, with an increase of $200 million in the fourth quarter. We expect that restructuring costs will diminish substantially over the course of 2009. MMC has no outstanding commercial paper bank loans. We continued to maintain a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility that remains un-drawn. Due to our annual incentive compensation payments, we expect to be users of cash in the first quarter of 2009, as is our typical pattern. Lastly, we have a $400 million bonds maturing in June of 2009. Our plan is to fund a significant portion of this maturity with new debt. As you know the credit markets are volatile and if the capital markets are unattractive to us, our cash position and bank clients will enable us to fund the maturity if required. With that, let me turn it back to Brian.
Brian Duperreault: Thanks Vanessa. I think it's time to begin the question-and-answer period. Just to remind you, that we have our operating company's CEOs here too to help. And with that operator, let's begin the Q&A.
Operator: Yes sir. (Operator Instructions). We'll go first to Keith Walsh with Citi.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup: Hey, good morning everybody. First question for Dan, as you finishing your... you finished your first year there obviously you've gotten a lot out in costs already. Where are you relative to where you thought you'd be a year ago and what are the opportunities on the cost side? And then just another piece to that, when you're talking about the retention, how that improved so significantly I guess over the last year as well as the last quarters? Is that partially driven by maybe the AIG situation out in the market, customers just stand put? Thanks.
Daniel Glaser: Okay, let me handle the question in a couple of parts, Keith. First of all, obviously I am very pleased with the quarter and very pleased with the year. Our... a lot of our margin expansion this year obviously is focused on expense reductions and our work on expenses is not done, and I would expect further expense reductions to contribute to earnings growth in 2009. But, as I've said from the beginning, this is not just a expense-reduction story. Ultimately, we will need to grow the business and grow the business better than we're presently growing the business, in order to reach the level of returns that I believe the firm is capable of. But, I think that in 2008, we laid the foundation for future growth through several actions. We reorganized the U.S. business, streamlining the structure, driving greater accountability for results. We are driving globally better sales discipline. We've improved client service, which is I think the predominant reason why you are seeing some improvement in revenue retention. And I believe it will also help us win more business in the future. We also have just really begun receiving compensation from carriers in recognition of the value and efficiency that our distribution and placement capabilities provide to them. And we formed the Marsh & McLennan agency. So, we've done a lot of things other than expense reduction. And so I feel we're well-positioned for 2009. Then moving onto the client retention situation, I don't think there is any impact in the marketplace on client retention based upon the current turbulence. I do think that it may help us in terms of gaining new clients, because in turbulent markets, there is always a fight to quality, and I think Marsh will do well in that milieu.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup: And then just to...
Brian Duperreault: Thank you. Keith?
Keith Walsh - Citigroup: Yeah?
Brian Duperreault: Did you want to say something else?
Keith Walsh - Citigroup: Yeah, I was going to just follow-up with the question. But, sorry, go ahead.
Brian Duperreault: I'm sorry, you can do that. I'll let you do that.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup: And then, Dan just a follow-up of my second question would be, when I think about the hub strategy, if you can expand a little bit on some of those payments. I heard recently in the news, AIG has signed on to this. So, have you gotten the full slate of underwriters paying, and is there something that's going to materially impact the bottom line in margins in '09? Thanks.
Daniel Glaser: Sure. Overall, our enhanced commission strategy and our commission strategies in general are global. So, they're not only linked to the U.S. and not only linked to our hub strategy. Essentially, our commission initiatives are in three parts: One, we wanted to look at the various lines of business and establish some level of minimums that we think are required to handle a piece of business. So, we have established our own internal view of what minimum rates should look like. Then in parts, in different places around the world, we've tried to negotiate an enhanced retail commission, where we could negotiate with carriers to receive something more than the minimum. And we've been successful in parts in doing that. And then, we have enhanced commission, which probably has gotten the most publicity, because it applies to both commission business and fee business. That's really a commission paid by carriers that is agreed at the corporate level, and it recognizes the value of things like our hubs and our distribution and quality control procedures. So, we're pursuing those kind of initiatives in many markets. I would say in... we've set down a path. This is going to be again a multiyear process. But I'm comfortable where we are. I don't expect material revenue change in 2009, based upon enhanced commission. But it should obviously help profit a bit more than the revenue side.
Brian Duperreault: Okay. Why don't we go to the next question?
Operator: Yes, sir. (Operator Instructions). We'll go next to Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Thank you, and good morning. I was wondering if Peter could perhaps talk a little bit about what Carpenter is looking at, going into '09. And I am particularly curious, whether... there were clearly some major missteps going into '08. And as we go into '09, is the company in a position to recover from some of those missteps and I guess, I am thinking about kind of a leveraged step up in revenue. Or, are we really just talking about growth off of what was a depressed and to some extent, a missed 2008 year?
Peter Zaffino: Larry, thank you. We believe we made a lot of significant changes in 2008 to position us for a positive growth for 2009, beyond rate. Vanessa mentioned that our new business has been up in the third and fourth quarter. That is also true for January. When we went through the restructuring earlier this year, we put together a very strong sales group that just focuses on top-line growth. In addition to that, we have identified areas where we think we're under-weighed relative to our market position that is in the international arena. So, it's the UK, Europe, to a lesser extent Japan and we feel we can grow in the specialty areas, marine and energy, retro as well as aviation. So our focus is going to be pushing growth beyond rate. Clearly the headwinds we had in 2008, we don't believe we'll have those in 2009 as rates will start to move upward slightly. But we're going to grow through new business beyond rate.
Brian Duperreault: Larry, are you there?
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Yeah, just a follow-up; does some of that missed opportunity in '08 comeback to you simply because you guys have your act together right now?
Peter Zaffino: I'd like to think so. In 2008 we...where we lost some business was in the U.S., which is our strongest geographic area for performance on revenue and profitability. So it was an anomaly. We feel like the new business has moved us in a very positive direction in the U.S. and don't believe you'll see that type of our experience for Guy Carp in 2009.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Great. Thanks very much.
Brian Duperreault: You are welcome, Larry. Next question please.
Operator: We'll go next to Meyer Shields with Stifel Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Brian Duperreault: Good morning.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I think it's a question for Dan or Brian. If you look at the brokerage mix of new and renewal business, is it more new business now than I guess long-term target or what?
Brian Duperreault: Dan?
Daniel Glaser: Yes, well I mean our new business this year was in total greater than our new business last year. And as I said last year, we've now grown $900 million of new business which would be a top-ten global insurance broker. So we grow the top-ten global insurance broker and we'll hopefully do that every year. So new business was very strong, it was higher this year than last year.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: But, what I am trying to get at is, I am assuming that it's more expensive to get new business in which case the new business growth which is what you want, you're still going to have some sort of negative impact on margins?
Daniel Glaser: Well, actually in my view, it's the opposite, because I am not growing infrastructure with new accounts. So my marginal benefit of a new piece of business is higher than an existing piece of business.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And I am sorry --
Brian Duperreault: Go ahead please.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, with regard to retirement consulting is that sort of... is that a negative or net positive, as we... as many clients have to figure out what to do with their pensions?
Brian Duperreault: Well I think that's a good one for Michele. Michele?
M. Burns: Yeah that's, in our view it's a net positive. We believe that what you would expect first of all legislative activity that we've already seen in the United States and are having conversations around the world. As well as the general need for clients to analyze their pension plans, that over time it is a net positive. We do think that the strength our retirement business is more reflected by our full-year performance in 2008 at around 5%, and we expect to continue to grow retirement in the low-single digits going into 2009.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, fantastic. Thanks so much.
Brian Duperreault: Okay. Thank you. Next question please?
Operator: We'll take our last question from (Inaudible).
Unidentified Analyst: If I can go back to the margin question; I think Brian I may have asked the last quarter that is there any particular reason why Marsh's margins would be below the other global brokers. And I believe as you've said it's a matter of both of the expense initiatives as well as the top line. So is it just sizing the expense structure and getting the top line going again. At some point do you think that gap will close meaningfully over a couple of years?
Brian Duperreault: Well Terry (ph) thanks for the question. It is mix a business issue and it's an operational question. I mean clearly Marsh was not performing well. So it didn't maximize its profitability with its business and had to fix that with expense controls and getting its processes right, et cetera. Dan's doing that. I think you heard from Dan, he is not... he doesn't fell he is finished with that process, that continues. Now as that changes just one piece of it, but there is also getting new revenue. It's a top line as well as an expense solution. He outlined things he is doing there. When you look at our margin against others, even with the progress we have made and it's considerable as I pointed out, almost 500 on those segments. We don't think we're near it and there is a mix of business issue too that has to come into play. The reinsurance has to be a bigger part of what we do particularly the international piece. The Marsh & McLennan agencies initiative is significant because that is a very high margin business. It's an area that we should excel in but we historically been bad at it. And so that's the whole segment of the market that should produce great business for us and will. But it's going to take a little while to get that. So when you put it all together, there's no reason why our margins segment-to-segment, geography-to-geography because the international courses are higher margin business than the U.S; so then segment-to-segment, geography-to-geography, we should match and preferably exceed our competitors. And so, that's our, that's our goal, talking about what we are look at in '09, even with the headwinds and interest rates and all of those things, we think we can get the whole segment to 16%, in '09. Its 13.3 now, that still isn't where we need to be, but it takes a while. But progress... I mean the thing, I think, one thing I can point to is when we had the call last year this time, it was all potential. And I think you've seen progress, I think the team, I think the people working in both Marsh and Guy Carpenter are world class and we are going to get there.
Unidentified Analyst: 16% again is sort of goal-end target for the current year.
Brian Duperreault: Yeah that's '09.
Unidentified Analyst: Right. Okay thank you so much.
Brian Duperreault: You are welcome Terry (ph). Okay. Well, listen thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate it and we look forward to talking to you again. Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation and wish you a wonderful afternoon.

Operator: Welcome to MMC's Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Third quarter 2008 financial results and supplemental information were issued early this morning. They are available on MMC's website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Looking-forward statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. In particular, references during this conference call to anticipated or expected results of operations for 2008 or subsequent periods are forward-looking statements and MMC's actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. Please refer to MMC's most recent SEC filings, as well as the company's earnings release, which are available on the MMC website, for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn this call over to Mr. Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I am Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC. I would like to welcome Vanessa Wittman, our new CFO who joined us in September. I'd also like to welcome our operating companies CEOs to today's call, Dan Glaser of Marsh, Michele Burns of Mercer, Peter Zaffino of Guy Carpenter, John Drzik of Oliver Wyman and Ben Allen of Kroll. Also joining us is Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations. After I make some brief remarks, Vanessa will present our financial results and then we will all take your questions. MMC's adjusted operating income in the quarter rose to $217 million, an increase of 50% from the third quarter of last year. This was all the more impressive given the current economic environment. I'm very pleased with the continued improvement in profitability at Marsh and with Mercer's overall strong results. And it is gratifying d to see Kroll continue to improve its profitability as well. Adjusting for noteworthy items, we have reestablished MMC's earnings growth. In the first nine months of 2008, adjusted operating income was $963 million, a 22% increase from the year ago period and a 9% increase from the 2006 period. Looking at Marsh's performance in the quarter, its clear the approach Dan and his team have taken is absolutely the right one for the company. They have undertaken a series of operational improvements and major initiatives that are geared toward better delivery of services through client segmentation and enhanced placement capabilities. Ultimately we believe this will also contribute to improved profitability. In the quarter, Marsh continued to produce revenue growth with an improved client revenue retention, something we have seen throughout the year. New business production remained strong. However, the main driver of Marsh's improved profitability has been expense reduction. In the quarter Marsh's underlying expense on an adjusted basis were down 4%. As a result, even as the soft insurance cycle persisted, Marsh was able to show significant margin improvement. While Dan and his team still have a lot of work in ahead of them, this is a solid start to a multi-year process that will enhance shareholder value. At Guy Carpenter difficult market conditions continue to affect results. Our previously announced restructuring at Guy Carpenter was in response to revenue declines earlier this year. The restructuring was well executed and we saw a full impact of expense savings in the third quarter. As a result Carpenter maintained its profitability at the same level as the prior year. This is in contrast with the first quarter of 2008, when we saw a meaningful decline in Carpenter's profitability as well as in the second quarter when the implementation of the restructuring plan resulted in only a modest decline in profitability. And as we look across at its fourth quarter, we anticipate an increase in operating income on a year-over-year basis. This is an impressive turn around managed by Peter, who was named CEO of Carpenter earlier this year. Now let me discuss our Consulting businesses. Mercer's third quarter results were excellent with the continuation of the strong revenue and earnings growth, the company produced in the first half of the year. Underlying revenue growth in the quarter was 10%, with strong results across all businesses. Mercer's consulting practices increased to 11%. Outsourcing increase 7% and investment consulting and management increased 12%. Growth and profitability was strong coupled with margin improvement, both for the quarter and for the nine months. Anyway you look at it, Mercer had an excellent quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, Michele and her team have been sensitive to the changing global economic conditions. As a result they began to implement cost containment measures earlier in the year. Although organic revenue growth remains strong in the quarter, Mercer continues to aggressively manage its expenses. This included a high degree of scrutiny over new hires and a concentrated focus on discretionary expenses. Mercer is also in the process of selectively reducing its headcount levels. Oliver Wyman makes up slightly less than 30% of our Consulting segment. As you would expect, given current conditions it has seen a weakening of demand for projects as the year has progressed, particularly in its Financial Services practice. While Oliver Wyman was able to produce modest revenue growth in the first half of the year, the rapidly deteriorating business conditions in the past few months resulted in revenue declining more quickly than anticipated. John and his team are looking for every opportunity to reduce expenses, to strike the right balance between near-term results and maintaining the capacity to serve clients when business conditions improve. Stepping back and viewing MMC's consulting operations as the whole, we are pleased that the strength at Mercer more than offset the weakness at Oliver Wyman. As a result, we reported an increase in operating income for our consulting segment. Year-to-date, the increase was 5% on an adjusted basis. Now turning to Risk Consulting and Technology; since Ben Allen was made CEO of Kroll in February, we have seen improvements in Kroll, particularly in profitability. Kroll has a range of businesses that are affected differently by economic conditions. Some businesses such as Corporate Investigations and Litigation Support are benefiting from the current economic environment. Conversely, we've seen pressure in other areas such as mortgage and employment related background screening. In the quarter, a number of Kroll businesses showed revenue growth, including Litigation Support and Data Recovery, Business Intelligence and Investigations and Government Services. Overall, profitability for Kroll, improved 14% in the third quarter. Corporate Advisor and Restructuring is also in this segment. Earlier this year we determined that this business did not fit with Kroll's strategy and segregated its operation. In the last week we sold Kroll to Zolfo Cooper, the U.S. restructuring business to several of its senior executives in a leveraged management buy-off. We are also very close to reaching agreements to sell the remaining international restructuring operations in similar transactions. Before I turn it over to Vanessa, to give you more detail on the quarter, I would like to take a moment to comment on the current operating environment our clients are facing. A fundamental transformation is occurring in the global financial system that is affecting multiple industries. There was an initial traumatic shock which is evolving in to a more chronic but nevertheless serious condition. Throughout the entire economic and business environment, there continues to be significant pressure. At MMC, we've been moving swiftly to bring our risk and human capital expertise to bear for clients as well as to capitalize on opportunities the current environment affords a company like ours. Mercer's launched a client content web portal entitled, Leading through unprecedented times. Using of variety of media the site demonstrates Mercer's thought leadership on the issues that matter most to its clients ranging from cost efficiency to employee engagement. Mercer is also developing a current line of integrated client out reach program to systematically identify and address issues raised by the current economic crises including the impact on pensions and healthcare. You can see more about this initiative on Mercer's website mercer.com. At Oliver Wyman although recent events have put significant pressure on it's business, our financial services clients will need top tier advice on risk management governance and approach strategic cost cutting and navigating the way of anticipated increased regulation. Other opportunities included advising private equity on investments strategy, increase corporate development and post merger integration work due to bank consolidation and working with the public sector as government involvement in the financial services sector increases. In Kroll, their Litigation Support and Data Recovery group is assisting clients who are facing governmental enquiries and an increase in litigation as a result of the crisis. Finally, both Marsh and Guy Carpenter have done an amazing job of helping clients during this unprecedented environment in the insurance industry. Marsh has been in constant communication with thousands of clients through conference calls and online update center, one-on-one meetings, and numerous industry events. Later this month, Marsh will host a summit in London with clients to discuss issues facing the industry. Similarly, Guy Carpenter has been working with clients to evaluate the changing market conditions. The reduction of surplus, due to equity market declines, asset impairment losses, and catastrophic events have made capital a precious commodity. In times like these clients typically look to reinsurance markets as a source of additional capital. Let me conclude by saying I am very pleased with amount of progress we have made throughout MMC in the past nine months. Although a great deal of effort is still required, we remain on track with our plans to improve profitability across the company. We are excited about the future and the many opportunities we have to offer our clients in the current difficult economic environment. Before I turn it over to Vanessa to present our financial results for the quarter, let me say how pleased we are that Vanessa has joined MMC. She is an experienced finance professional with a proven track record at large multifaceted organizations. I hope over the coming months you'll have an opportunity to spend some time with her. Vanessa?
Vanessa A. Wittman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks very much, Brian and good morning everyone. I am very pleased to join MMC and to be part of Brian's senior management team. I also look forward to building long term relationship to the investors and analysts who follow our Company. Just to frame my comments today; I want to cover three areas. First I'll walk through the series of items that impacted our third quarter results; especially compared with the third quarter of 2007. Next, I will turn to the operational results, including a few corporate items. Then I'll cover our cash position and liquidity and make some comments on pension. Let's start with the three items that made quarter-to-quarter comparisons difficult. First; investment income, then discontinued operations, and finally noteworthy items. Let's start with investment income; investment losses reduced GAAP earnings per share by $0.03 in the third quarter of 2008. MMC reported in investment loss of $23 million in the quarter which was primarily due to mark-to-market declines in investments within our private equity portfolio. This was slightly higher than anticipated when we held our second quarter call, because there was a write down on warrants received on a client engagement in the corporate, restructuring, and advisory group. The $23 million loss compared with investment income of $78 million in the third quarter of '07 results in a negative swing of $101 million or $0.13 per share on year-over-year basis. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, investment income should approximate the $10 million of income we reported in the fourth quarter of 2007. Now let's just look at discontinued operations. Within GAAP earnings, we had discontinued operations in both periods, most significantly the sale of Putnam last year. As its customary, with most large transactions, contingent abilities including income taxes have been retained with the sale of Putnam, adjustment result in [ph] credits and charges that flow through discontinued operations. We have seen this in each quarter over the last year and expect to continue to see it in future period. In the quarter discontinued operation was a loss of $0.05 a share. This was primarily due to a tax adjustment pertaining to the sale of Putnam and to a lesser extent, a loss in the sale of small component of Kroll's Government Services operation. Finally, let's turn to noteworthy items. On a GAAP basis, EPS from continuing operations was $0.03 a share. Noteworthy items in the current quarter as described on page 10 of our supplemental schedules were $0.18 a share. This resulted in adjusted EPS in the third quarter totaling $0.21, flat with the prior year. Apart from these noteworthy items, the results saw an additional $33 million charge at Marsh resulting from an adverse legal decision rendered last week. This reduced adjusted EPS by $0.04. Now let's move on to results of operations. As Brian stated, adjusted operating income for MMC in the third quarter increased 50% primarily due to the significant improvement at Marsh. Within Risk and Insurance Services, Marsh's third quarter revenue increased 3% to $1.1 billion. Revenue growth on an underlying basis was 1%. If we exclude the fiduciary interest income as some of our peers do, Marsh's underlying revenue growth was 2% in the quarter. Marsh's client revenue retention rates, which measures the dollar amount of client revenue retained was three percentage points higher in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. New business production was inline with last year's strong results. While Marsh has been successful in achieving organic revenue growth during very difficult market conditions, it's driving significant growth in operating income through on going expense reduction and cost discipline. For example when you exclude fiduciary interest income, Marsh generated revenue growth in the third quarter of 2% while underlying operating expenses on a adjusted basis were down 4%. Dan's been updating you on the restructuring activities that have been ongoing at Marsh throughout the year, but to briefly recap. Headcount reductions were 640 in the third quarter of total staff 1,150 staff reduction so far this year. Approximately 250 reductions remain. The staff reductions in the third quarter led to a severance charge of $50 million with anticipated annualized savings of $66 million. These reductions are in addition to the roughly 600 position that were transferred to Carpenter in July. Carpenter was part of the UK back office outsourcing initiatives that was discussed on our second quarter earnings call. Marsh's adjusted operating income in the third quarter increased by $65 million or $98 million excluding the charge to the adverse legal decision. As we indicated on last quarter's earnings call; Marsh's operating margin improvement on an adjusted basis for the first six months of this year was about 500 basis points. For the nine months, Marsh's margin improvement is now above 500 basis points. Meeting our goal of a 500 basis point margin improvement for the full year implies a year-over-year improvement of 350 basis points in the fourth quarter. We think this is a reasonable expectation. In conclusion not only the third quarter but the first nine months of the year have been very successful for Marsh. Now let's look at Guy Carpenter. The insurance rates continued to decline year-over-year. But Carpenter managed to do well in this difficult environment from a profitability standpoint. While third quarter underlying revenue declined 10%, adjusted operating expenses declined 12%, allowing Carpenter to maintain its profitability year-over-year. Our Consulting segment's growth in both revenue and operating income in the third quarter was led by Mercer. Mercer's revenue performance was excellent. 12% reported growth and 10% growth on an underlying basis. All of Mercer's businesses generated strong underlying revenue growth in the third quarter. Mercer's operating income rose 24% resulting in third quarter operating margin improving by more than a 100 basis points. We are very pleased with Mercer's performance in the third quarter. At Oliver Wyman continued uncertainty in the U.S. economic environment and difficulties in the financial services industry resulted in a 5% decline in underlying revenue in the quarter. For the nine months Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth was 1%. This has led to a decrease in profitability this year as revenue growth has declined more quickly than anticipated. As Brian, mentioned Oliver Wyman continued to look for opportunities to reduce expenses while protecting long term franchise value. Before we leave the Consulting segment, just to remind you that last year's fourth quarter results for Oliver Wyman included success fees of roughly $30 million. And we do not anticipate replicating these fees in this year's fourth quarter. Within our Risk Consulting and Technology segment, Kroll's 14% growth and operating income was more than offset by the decline at corporate advisory and restructuring. Kroll which represents 86% of this segment's revenue and all of the segments profitability have revenue of $218 million in the third quarter, an increase of 4% compared with last year. The Corporate Advisory and Restructuring group which we separated operationally from Kroll in the first quarter of this year had a revenue decline of 25%. Even though expenses are greatly reduced on a year-over-year basis, it reported a modest loss, similar to the first two quarters of 2008. Now let me briefly discuss several corporate items. The corporate restructuring charge of $49 million in the quarter reflects the near completion of an initiative MMC began two years ago to reduce occupancy costs in our headquarters building in New York. MMC sold five floors in the fourth quarter of 2006 realizing a gain of $74 million. MMC continues to own over half of this buildings. As planned an additional five leased floors have now been vacated resulting in the charge. The charge represents the future rent on non-cancelable leases, net of estimated sub lease income. As we have mentioned frequently you receive variability quarter-to-quarter in MMC tax rates. Based on the first three quarters the tax rate on adjusted operating income for the full year should be approximately 30%. Now let's turn to liquidity and pensions. Our liquidity position is strong. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $1.5 billion, an increase of $300 million since June 30. MMC typically generates strong operating cash flow in the fourth quarter. Net debt was $2.1 billion at the end of the third quarter compared with $2.4 billion at the end of the second quarter. We do not have any additional debt maturing until June 2009. MMC has no outstanding commercial paper or bank loans and we continue to maintain a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility that remains undrawn. Let me say a few words about pensions. On a global basis, MMC operate a defined benefit plan in approximately 25 countries, although the US and the UK plans account for the vast majority. Going into 2008, MMC's pension plans were over funded on a GAAP basis by $942 million. During 2008 we will contribute about $275 million for the full year. We monitor funded status for both GAAP and statutory purposes very closely. Every year we remeasure assets and liabilities in our defined benefit pension plans at year-end. A significant driver of our pension liabilities and expense is the discount rate, which we calculate using a proprietary bond model. An important input into the model is long-term AA rated bond trade. We won't have a firm view of next year's pension expense until we perform a re-measurement at year-end. Before I turn it back to Brian, I'd like to comment directly on our third quarter results in relation to the expectations of the investment community. The range of First Call estimates for the third quarter was $0.23 to $0.37 of adjusted EPS. We think this range is indicative of the difficulty analysts had in estimating this particular quarter, both because of last year's unusual third quarter and because of the very strong second quarter results this year. Based on the average First Call adjusted EPS estimate of $0.32 per share, we believe the components of the GAAP are $0.01 from Oliver Wyman, $0.02 from investment income, $0.04 from the adverse legal decision and $0.04 from Marsh's underlying results. While there was a range of estimates, Marsh's revenue in the quarter generally met street expectations. However, Marsh's operating margin was lower than the average expectation. We think this gap in expectations is due to the difficulty in estimating profitability in Marsh's seasonally smallest quarter. Going forward we don't think this will be an issue. And with that let me turn it back to Brian.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, thank you, Vanessa. And... we're ready for questions. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you Mr. Duperreault. This question and answer session will be conducted electronically. In the interest of fairness we ask that you limit yourself to one question and perhaps a follow-up. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Keith Walsh. Please state the name of your company before asking your question.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup: Hi, good morning everyone. This is Keith Walsh at Citi.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Keith.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks. Two question for Dan. First on the hub strategy, if you could just give us a quick update there and just broader. It seems like it's easier for underwriters to do business with you guys with this hub strategy that you have been talking about. Is there an ability for you to extract some of those economics? And then, I have a follow-up.
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: Okay, just to recap the hub strategy, which is really predominantly a U.S. strategy. Because if you recall London sort of acts a natural hub in Europe and in other parts of the world. So, the creation of the hub, first of all is geared towards clients. So, the idea is to create concentrated placement and product expertise. So, we would be able to innovate and deliver more value for clients by creating more completion amongst insurers, negotiating better terms and conditions and having a better craft [ph] at achieving contract certainty. But as you mentioned Keith, there is also value for carriers in these hubs. It gives them greater efficiency, lower cost, the potential for things like standardized submission. And so, we definitely are in negotiations with carriers to extract some of the economics that you mentioned. We call that initiative within Marsh, the enhanced commission strategy. And it's too early to call right now. But I am hopeful with the discussions that we've been having with carriers that they recognize the value. Of course any value that we will be able to negotiate with carriers will be fully disclosed to clients and I would reiterate, it's not contingent on volume or profitability. It will be based upon the value that we create.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup: That's great. And then, the second question, few weeks back you guys formed MMC agency to serve the smaller client segment. Is this going to be an outlook for your M&A dollars, since there is really, I guess, no longer any larger deals out there, it seems like. And you are going to be accepting additional forms of compensation such as supplementals from this new agencies business? Thanks.
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: Okay. I'm very excited about the Marsh & McLennan agency. And I love the rebirth of the name Marsh & McLennan in the agency broker space. And I can tell you that our colleague bases [ph] are enthusiastic about that as well around the world. So the Marsh & McLennan agency will be one of the largest agency in the United States within a very short period of time. It's geared to the notion of that in these small and lower corporate segment including some personal lines as well, that it's more likely to be a product solution than any kind of let's say the folk solution. You just can't economically develop the folk type of solutions in the lower corporate space. And so, our goal will be to negotiate with carriers to develop terrific Marsh & McLennan products which we will then market heavily into the lower corporate segment. We clearly within that because on that basis, we're as an agent we're more representing carriers than clients, actually our customer we will be marketing to customers throughout the United States. But we will be an agent of limited number of carriers. And clearly, we believe that we will be able to optimize commission income by adopting an agency strategy rather than a full brokerage strategy in that space. In terms of M&A, it's a highly fragmented market. I see different numbers around the numbers of agents that exist in United States and you see a big swing with regards to that but suffice to say that there are tens of thousands of agents in the U.S., who generally have revenues of $5 million, brokerage revenues $5 million and less. So, there is an awful lot of Mom & Pop shops. And we do believe that we can be a consolidator in that space.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup: Thanks a lot.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Keith, next question please.
Operator: And we'll take over next question from Meyer Shields. Please state the name of your company.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Meyer Shields from Stifel Nicolaus. Good morning everyone.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Vanessa A. Wittman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Can you talk a little bit about the turmoil at AIG implies for revenues and expenses over the next 12 months?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Could you just repeat that again Meyer. I'm not sure, I heard that right?
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sure, the turmoil at AIG, I'm wondering how you're looking at, what that implies in terms of incremental revenues and incremental expenses for the next quarter?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: The AIG situation?
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Okay. Well, I will give you my point of view and Dan and Peter may have a different one. Certainly the situation has been topical for our clients. We spend a great deal of time speaking to clients about it. And it basically is maybe a leading indicator of what's happening overall in the marketplace, which is, this decline in the capital. All market changes are different, this one is all asset driven. And AIG has had problems with its asset base. Not necessarily in its insurance companies but overall its ability to trade. But that has we see drops in assets across the entire industry taking, what I call the surplus outs. So, what I think it has it certainly changes a carrier's point of view about its own capital base. The price of risk starts to go up as a result. You can't avoid it. You can't raise capital in this current market. So you have to be much more careful about it. You have to preserve it. You still have event driven issues that could come across at any moment, that could take capital out of this industry without an ability to replace. And so you've got to protect yourself. You buy in more reinsurance. You start... you don't cut the prices like you did before. Where this goes, it's very difficult. This is as I said, all these changes are different, this in addition to be an asset driven change, it's happening in the middle of a global significant recession. Global recessions tend to keep volume down, because our prices in many classes of business are driven by sales or payrolls, things that are sensitive to economic activity. So, I think all of that is going to put some balance in this thing. But generally speaking it should stop the decline and start to change the market. But it's very difficult to predict the magnitude of it, when it really starts to appear and how long it goes.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: That all is mine. Thank you.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: If I can turn to the next really quickly. When you say, you gave us 350 basis point margin improvement numbers for the fourth quarter. Is there a reason to expect the year-over-year margin expansion to decline or is that just, why do we take that 500 basis point full year number?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Do you want to take this Vanessa.
Vanessa A. Wittman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure, Meyer, I just want to make sure, the connection is a little bit rough. You're asking about the 350 basis points for the fourth quarter?
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right.
Vanessa A. Wittman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And then I couldn't quite hear the second piece of it.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, the question is why would it be less than say the 500 to--
Vanessa A. Wittman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I apologize.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, maybe Dan could do that, Dan you want to take that?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: Yes, sure. I think what you have to look at is when you look at last year, within Marsh, you'll recall that Marsh had a difficult second and third quarter. And the first quarters and the fourth quarters were actually not so rough. And so, we are beginning to lack some of the benefits through expense reductions and the like. So, we do fully expect to see substantial margin improvement in the fourth quarter. And on balance, the absolute margin will be significantly better than say the third quarter which is our lowest margin quarter. And I think the 350 is just an attempt to say, listen, when we started the year. And I think on our first quarter call we talked about getting to maybe 200, 250 basis points in the year. We were outperforming that very quickly in getting to about 500. And I think my team and I would view a 500 basis point improvement for the year is been a job well done.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, I got it. Thank you.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Meyer. Next question please.
Operator: And our next question is from Alain Karaoglan. Please state your company.
Alain Karaoglan - Banc of America: Good morning, Alain Karaoglan with Banc of America. Just following up, Brian on the question regarding the environment and I don't know if Peter want to address it. Are you seeing increased demand for reinsurance from your customers at Guy Carpenter? And are you seeing sort of decreased capacity and tightening of terms by the reinsurance industry? Or is it just yet conjecture and par [ph]?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, well Peter, over to you.
Peter Zaffino - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: That's yours.
Peter Zaffino - President and Chief Executive Officer: For January 1, we are starting to see increased demand in exploring alternative reinsurance structures. As Brian mention in his opening statement, now that we have asset impairment with that catastrophe losses, there is rating agency implications. So, we think the supply will be less at January 1. And there is a lot of exploration for alternatives to come up with solutions for surplus enhancement through reinsurance as well as mitigating volatility in one's portfolio. How that will play out, we'll figure that out probably over the next 30 to 60 days. And we do think that there is going to be less supply because many reinsures are going to really look at the capital preservation very closely and want to be able to trade forward in the event of another major catastrophe. So, we'll learn more in the next 30 to 60 days where we expect to see supply down and pricing start to move in a band, but move upward.
Alain Karaoglan - Banc of America: And if I could do with a numbers questions. Shareholders equity Vanessa declined in the quarter by around $600 million from the second quarter if I did the math right. What's causing that?
Vanessa A. Wittman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Largely due to foreign exchange which should wash out over the course of the year.
Alain Karaoglan - Banc of America: Okay. Well, thank you very much.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Matthew Heimermann. Please state your company name, sir.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Sure, JPMorgan, good morning everybody.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning Matt.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Good morning. Couple of questions and hopefully these are quick. But first, Vanessa, could you just remind us with respect to FX, how much of that is hedged and then what isn't hedged is there proportional impact on revenue expenses or is there some arbitrage in there?
Vanessa A. Wittman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, we don't hedge our FX because we have a natural hedge in our business. Both because it's an international business and it's because the international components have revenues coming in foreign currencies but expenses going out in those foreign currencies and dollars. And as we have said in prior calls over the course of the year, it may be up or down for a quarter. But over the course of the year, we have generally been flat as to impact on foreign exchange.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: So, if there was let's say a 500 basis point change in currency translation, '09 versus '08, you wouldn't expect any impact on your numbers?
Mike Bishop - Investor Relations: Matt, this is Mike Bishop. Really we've seen that over the last 20 years and over an entire year you will not see it. You may see it a little bit in one quarter and it may go in the other direction in other quarters. And in fact in this quarter, we already had a foreign exchange going against Mercer. So, Michele's results for Mercer were even stronger when you look at it. Foreign exchange in the quarter was the minimus [ph] for us. The other thing you have to take into account is there are a number of major currencies and actually they're starting to walk in different directions, the Sterling for example now it's weakening whereas the euro is stronger. Unlike some of our competitors they may be doing different things this has never really been an issue for MMC.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Okay. Maybe I'll follow up Brian for a bit deeper discussion on that thing.
Mike Bishop - Investor Relations: Okay.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: The other question that I had is a follow up to Dan's comments earlier. But I mean, my question would be if there is a shortage of supply. How much do prices be derived before you would start to pull capital markets capacity back into the business which seems to whether it's independent of companies, aligned with companies or inter companies which seem to be the logical source of the supplies? What do you think the clearing price is going to be such that you start to incent people to the increased supply?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's really an interesting question. I don't know, as I said this one is a little different. At the moment it doesn't look like there is capital market supply available. It just doesn't seem that way. On the reinsurance side we see alternative style capital movements more than we see in the... on the primary, there we are not seeing... and we are seeing a basically decline. We don't see alternative capital market solutions coming into the markets. So if that goes away, then you are back to the classic straight investments in insurance companies and I'm not smart enough to predict when that comes back. Right now we don't see it.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Okay. That's right. And then just one request as just historically you haven't put the depreciation and amortization in the press release, it'd just be helpful I'm going through numbers if you might do that going forward?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: So my one request for Vanessa, if I may.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes we got it, made a note of it.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Thank you.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: Jay Cohen. Please go ahead sir with your company name.
Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Jay Cohen from Merrill Lynch.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Jay.
Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch: Hey, Brian. Two questions, the first is, if you could talk a bit more about this seasonality issue. I guess, a lot of us were surprised that the margin fell so much from the second quarter. And if you could talk about that and why there won't be an issue going forward? And then separately, this is more of a picky one, but it was a $10 million credit for a payment received from U.S. investigation services. Could you just tell us what that was?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Dan will take the first one which is the seasonality issue and Vanessa will take the second.
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: Okay. And for years our third quarter at Marsh, the revenues are lower than the first, second and fourth. I mean, so if you look at our business the first second and fourth revenue are generally pretty consistent. The third quarter as I said for years is a bit lower and expenses as you would expect are pretty consistent throughout the year. And so it is not unusual for us at all to have the margin dip in the third quarter and in fact I think on the second quarter call, I alluded to that, that we didn't expect, that we expected a softer third quarter just because the revenues are lower in the third quarter. It's not a big renewal base in the third quarter. So that pattern you'll see going forward as well but and... but I would take the view that when in compared to last year we've had a very significant increase in actual profitability, when you take out the adjustments and the affect of the E&O [ph] claim.
Vanessa A. Wittman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: On your second question, Jay. I think we mentioned in the second quarter's call, we gave you a heads up that there was a pending agreement around Mike Cherkasky and we filed an 8-K on his agreement and that $10 million credit, that's where that 10 million is coming from.
Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks a lot.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome Jay, thanks. Next question please.
Operator: Brian Meredith. Please go ahead with your company name.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Yes, UBS. Good morning everybody.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Brian, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the economic slowdown we're seeing globally. And what impact or what headwind do you think it's going to have on your revenue growth here going forward in the next 12 months? And maybe break it down between Marsh and Mercer?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, well, yes, break it I'll go through other ones in my analysis. As I said earlier about this change in market conditions, there is a bit of countervailing forces here. I would expect price change would be positive, not negative, that's my expectation. How much I don't know. That coupled with I think some of the initiatives should help the revenue side. Now the flip side of that is that is it's a recession and the clients are facing price cuts across many of their spends. So looking at the spend for insurance and the insurance, in Consulting, it's going to be pressurized going other way. But overall, I guess, I'm more positive than negative, put it that way. And throwing in Carpenter, we would expect Carpenter, certainly year-over-year has showed some improvement, just in general, because it was such a bad year. To start with... but in addition to that I think some of the initiatives that they have taken in terms of revenue, client retention, the client increase will start to see. So, overall I guess, I was generally positive about the insurance side of the business. Let's take consulting, its two parts, the Mercer dominating to some degree. 70, 30, Mercer I must say has done just a fabulous job this year under really difficult circumstances. Third quarter was a great quarter, it cannot be sustained, I'm not betting that it would be sustained, it's just unlikely given that market conditions whether we can keep going at that pace. But we still think we have some growth in Mercer. So we would expect positive revenue growth in Mercer, but not at the rates we've been seeing. Oliver Wyman; well it's just unlikely that all the Oliver Wyman is going to show positive growth rates, we're down to 1% and turning negative at Olive Wyman, that will run its course, it will come back a little bit as the year unfolds and as company starts to come to grips with the new world they are living in, they will reach out the Consultant side. I believe that and I think there will be a time when we will start to see that come back as it always has. Overall I think there will be positive growth in the Consulting segment, but Oliver Wyman will dampen this positiveness that's taking place in the other side. And that's brings me to Kroll and as I mentioned in the prepared remarks side, Kroll has a diversified portfolio interestingly enough. And where it touches litigation, investigation et cetera well, looking at litigation, that would seem to be recession proof. We would expect that they would see quite a bit of activity, anything having to do with mortgages or employment will probably go down. But overall I think given expense controls, we should see a positive growth in their volume on the top line and I think with expense controls we can manage through this. So those are three segments, each one of them for different reasons I feel reasonably positive about '09.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Great. And then a quick question for Peter. Peter when you talked about the increase demand in the reinsurance market place, is that a cause for casualty and property or is it more focused on the property or the casualty given some of the capital issues we are seeing with primary companies.
Peter Zaffino - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, right now, the answer is both and I will tell you why. Property clearly retentions were higher with Hurricane Ike, we've taken a look at some of the model results and of course even RMS revised our estimate upward last week. So clients are taking a look at the property retentions and the amount of reinsurance we are purchasing at different return periods. But then again back to the original comments around capital, looking at different type of pro-rata, or surplus relief structures really across the entire portfolio which would include casualty, property will move first on any rate in casualty usually follows but we're starting to see more surplus relief structures as we look into January 1 and in 2009.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Thank you.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Thank you. No other question?
Operator: Dan Farrell, your company name please.
Dan Farrell - Fox-Pitt Kelton: Thank you, Fox-Pitt Kelton. Couple of questions, firstly can you just refresh us that the mix of revenue at Marsh fee versus Commission and then can you also just talk about all of your ongoing efforts to replace loss contingent revenue and tell us how that's going. And then finally can you talk a little about what your view is for expense leverage heading into 2009? You've taken out a lot of expense this year, broadly speaking how much more in that and do you think you have to go as we head into next year.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. That might get us [ph] everything right. Yes, okay so Dan, you want to take it.
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: f let me make sure I get this in the right order. But if we start with your, the first premise, or maybe the second premise in terms of loss contingence, we are not going to be replacing $850 million dollars of contingent income. And that's the function of the past, it is different Marsh. Having said that we will grow our revenue will certainly grow our profitability in the short-term, and we will develop ways of growing this business but I am not finding for the days of contingencies or after loss contingency. In terms of fee versus commission the U.S. business and international business are sort of mirror images of each other that arrive at about 50-50 split in our total business. It's weighted towards fee in the US and it's weighted towards commission internationally but at the end result we arrive at about 50-50. And in terms of expense leverage, we have done an awful lot of things this year. There are the proper things to do, there is a lot more for us to do. So, when I look at what we've done through the course of this year, you will arrive at a figure of around $350 million between the reductions in corporate that happened or that were identified in late fourth quarter last year and the early first quarter of this year. We've eliminated as we've noted before about 1700 physicians year-to-date. And in addition, we've outsourced... within that we've outsourced the number of physicians about 700 positions. I do think that there are some additional reductions to go. As Vanessa, mentioned in the fourth quarter we would expect there be about another 250 headcount reductions. But where my management team and I are going through the business, some parts of the business with a scalpel and some parts of the business with an axe. We're not done and we have a philosophy of there's always a smarter way. And so I don't want to give you the impression that the expense reductions have run their course. I think there is a fair amount more that we can do on the expense side. To give you an example, we would think that this is a continual process, a long term process in improving the business. Just bear in mind we're only 10 months into what I think is a multi-year turnaround until this business is truly optimized. And just in the last couple of months, we've worked through some real estate efficiency savings, some IT savings. We've managed IT; we've managed T&E for example very aggressively it's here. And so, there is a significant amount of savings that goes out, I would say ultimately while we're hoping for some revenue growth in some list, we don't need revenue growth anything more than very modest revenue growth and will still be able to drive profitability for certainly another couple of years.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. Another question please.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jay Gelb. Please state your company.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Thanks. I had a question for Dan. Dan, how much does AIG account for the premium placement within Marsh?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: Well, AIG is our largest trading partner and if you look at the entire segment of risk and insurance it equates to about 12 %.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Okay, thanks. And as my sense is that many customers will be looking for alternatives. To what extent does that create a drag on the expense for Marsh and is there any potential revenue offset for that?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: Yes, there is couple of things. One, I don't think it create a drag on expense because we're not hiring anymore people to take on the additional work when our customers seek alternatives. And I think it should be fair and at least in the initial couple of months while alternatives are been sort. There is not a huge movement. I think there is some diversification. And in fact that might be a smart way for companies to proceed. And I'm not talking about AIG specifically, I'm just talking about insurance capital in general of value to diversification. So, on the one hand yes, there is more work. And that will suck up some of the under utilization or the excess capacity that we have. But we don't need to hire anybody else. So, we won't see anything on the expense side. And on the other side in terms of revenue I think both I would hope that AIG would ultimately recognize that they're causing us to do more work. And therefore maybe we can negotiate some better commissions here and there. I think in the overall, the total business as it's commonly known in the industry has it tends to be on of the poorer payers on a commission basis. So, there would be natural and diversification to get a little bit of lift through diversification.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Okay. Thanks. And then, couple of issues yes, quick question for Vanessa. I know you gave a comment on pensions directionally, basically you know today, would you expect pension expense to be directionally higher or lower or roughly in line for 2009?
Vanessa A. Wittman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, as you know the remeasuring takes place at the end of the year and it's got so many variables in it that I wouldn't be comfortable commenting. But we would expect it to be roughly in line if we would redo it today.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Thanks very much.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Jay. Thank you. Let me take maybe a last question or two more. Go ahead please.
Operator: Terry Shu [ph] has the next question. Please state your company name.
Unidentified Analyst: Terry Shu [ph] from Pioneer Investments. I want to go back to the question of margins. Brian, if you can talk about longer term margin expectations. If you look at Marsh now, your margins relative to your two large peer brokers, Aon and Willis. It's meaningfully lower and years ago with cycles, prior cycles Marsh, with contingent commissions had close to industry leading margins. So, should we... how should we think about it? Should broker margins given comparable mix, be similar over time or not? How should we look at it? You talked about having the opportunity to expand margins over a multi-year period. But do you reach some optimal level? Can you expand on that, please?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Terry. Well, first of all two low, I mean, historically, I think the trajectory is in the right direction. And what is... we should have medium terms loans term goals. Medium term goals is to be comparable, we're not yet. And that's where Dan's, work continues, that's why he said it was a multi-year process. I like the trajectory, you can't get there overnight. We have a model change; obviously, you go from a contingency dependent model to standard models. You have to adjust yourself. I think they've done a real good job of changing the company almost from top to bottom, the hubbing approach et cetera, are indications of that activity. So, in the near term the goal is to get the comparable levels and we believe that we should be the superior. We think with the brand name, the client activity that we have loyalty, et cetera. Our international spread and the quality of our people, all would tell me we should be superior. But we got to get there and we're not going to get there overnight but I like the trajectory.
Unidentified Analyst: That means, though that you have many hundreds of points... basis points of improvements yet to come to be comparable because you lag by a meaningful margin now.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: That is absolutely correct.
Unidentified Analyst: Right. So
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: We have hundreds of basis points of improvement to do.
Unidentified Analyst: So, can we see that in a two year period, three year period. Do you have kind of a time type of goal?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, a multi-year is more than one.
Unidentified Analyst: Right.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: No, it's not going to be a decade, it's some where... and it will be that long. But it will take us a couple of years and as you can imagine it's very difficult to predict this exactly. I mean if we move the 500 this year in a slower cycle. We're talking about at over an entire cycle of good and bad. So, there is got to be that part of it too. So market conditions have to allow some more rapid growth if that's possible. But, it's not an impossible task, there is no reason why our margins would be less than anybody else's. But we do have to get there and changing this company from top to bottom does creates a little bit of friction which we have to clear out. But there is no reason why we can't do it.
Unidentified Analyst: One quick question on Guy Carpenter. Why are you not a bit more optimistic that revenues can turn off with, you said increased demand and reinsurance with? And all the Bermuda reinsures now saying that we are going to see a very strong market. And if you can also comment on the on Aon, Benfield combination, what does that do to the reinsurance brokerage landscape?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's... when I did my earlier talk about the two of... the company and I did say that we expect that Guy Carpenter to have a positive increase next year.
Unidentified Analyst: Right.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: I do. And so, I'm not saying anything else. And we would expect that Guy Carpenter would show improvement in its top line and certainly in its bottom line. No question about it.
Unidentified Analyst: Right.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Aon Ben Field, well, look at we've lost a competitor, that's never a bad thing. And so, all that have to shake out but for us it should be positive in terms of clients looking to balance their portfolio between players, so it's a good thing.
Unidentified Analyst: So, you wouldn't agree with some of the reinsure managements or Bermuda company management comment that we're going to see a super firm upside cycle and reinsurance would you?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: From their list to guidance, yes, I said, look at this market; it's a different hard market than we have ever seen, harder market, right?
Unidentified Analyst: Right.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: And that's in [indiscernible] by the way but we would expect changes to take place. But its asset driven into piece of a recession, I can't predict that, I don't know what that means in terms of super hard or long-term or short-term. But all the signs point to a change. And so that's the one thing we know that there is a change in the wind that's taking place. And it remains to be seen how the economic events of this world whether capital comes back into the marketplace? Is there another event? All those things we'll have to play out for us to really know where it goes.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Terry, thank you. And I think we probably should close the call. With that I want to thank everybody for your attention and appreciation. And look forward to talking to you again. Thank you.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to MMC's Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Second quarter 2008 financial results and supplemental information were issued early this morning. They are available on MMC's website at www.mmc.com Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward- looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. In particular, references during this conference call to anticipated or expected results of operations for 2008 or subsequent periods are forward-looking statements and MMC's actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. Please refer to MMC's most recent SEC filings, as well as the company's earnings release, which are available on the MMC website for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn this call over to Mr. Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I am Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me and presenting on the call today are Matt Bartley, our CFO; and Dan Glaser, CEO of Marsh. After I make some brief remarks, Matt will present our financial results. And Dan will share with you his insights into Marsh's strong performance during the quarter. I'd also like to welcome our operating company CEOs to today's call; Michele Burns of Mercer, Peter Zeffino, of Guy Carpenter, John Drzik of Oliver Wyman, and Ben Allen of Kroll. Also joining us is Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations. Let me began by saying that MMC's excellent results in the quarter were driven by a significantly improved operating performance in Marsh and strong revenue growth at Mercer and Kroll. Looking at Marsh's performance in the quarter, it is clear that the recovery is picking up speed. Revenue is growing throughout the world, reflecting both higher client revenue retention and increased new business. Expenses are being closely monitored with a noticeable improvement in management accountability. And morale has significantly improved. Senior leadership of Marsh has acted on input from colleagues from around the globe, and employees are bracing the resulting changes. They not only are willing to change, they are asking what more can we do. In the near future, Marsh will be making several important changes and improvements to its business model and Dan will discuss these in his remarks. All of these efforts should allow Marsh to show continued improvement even as a soft insurance market cycle continues. At Guy Carpenter, difficult market conditions continue to effect results. Our previously announced restructuring at Guy Carpenter was in reaction to net new business declines in the first part of the year. The execution of the restructuring has gone well, and all necessary steps are being implemented rapidly, a credit to Peter Zaffino. These were tough, but necessary steps that needed to be taken to protect Carpenter's profitability. Additionally, Peter and his team have reduced other cost to better align expense with the revenue levels. As a result, unlike the first quarter when there was a meaningful decline at Carpenter's profitability, this more disciplined approach resulted in only a modest decline in the second quarter. And lastly, we are seeing improvement in the Carpenter's new business origination with a success rate of competitive RFPs year-to-date significantly ahead of what was achieved in 2007. However, the majority of this new business will not impact revenue until next year. Mercer had an excellent quarter. This was a continuation of a strong revenue growth we saw from Mercer in first quarter. Underlying revenue growth in the quarter was 9% with a strong growth experienced across all businesses. Areas of particular strength were investment consulting and health and benefits. While we are satisfied with Mercer's growth, we are also sensitive to the current economic environment, particularly in the United States and the UK, Mercer's two largest geographies. To address this, Michele and her team had begun to prudently implement cost containment measures to maintain growth and profitability even if revenue growth moderates. Conversely, Oliver Wyman, which makes up 30% of our consulting segment, has seen a weakening of demand primarily from U.S.-based clients. This caused underlying revenue growth in the first half of the year to slow to 4% from the mid-teens growth Oliver Wyman had experienced over the last four years. We're also seeing early indications of slower growth in Europe. As a result, John and his team are vigilantly managing operating expenses and consultant productivity. Taken together, we are pleased to report that the strength at Mercer more than offset this weakness at Oliver Wyman. As a result, we reported an increase in operating profit for our Consulting segment in the second quarter. Turning to Kroll, the second quarter showed very strong revenue growth, 20% on a reported basis and 11% underlying. This strong growth occurred at Ontrack, which provides litigation support technology services, it's due to exceptionally strong demand for electronic discovery, and in the business intelligence and investigations group, which provides outsourced investigator services transactional due diligence, and security-related consulting. Not only did Kroll had a strong quarter with respect to revenue growth, we are also pleased to see Ben and his team significantly improved profitability. You will see the profitability for the Risk Consulting and Technology segment improved on a non-GAAP basis. However, this understates Kroll's significant improvement in profitability as the corporate advisor and restructuring business, which is also in this segment, had a loss in the quarter. Let me conclude by saying I'm very pleased with the amount of progress we have made throughout MMC in the past six months. We have reestablished the earnings power of Marsh. This quarter each of our segments saw an increase in revenue and operating income. And although a great deal of effort is still required, it's gratifying to show strong operating results this quarter. We are excited about the future. And with that, I will turn it over to Matt to present our financial results for the quarter.
Matthew B. Bartley - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Brain. Good morning. Before I discuss MMC's financial results for the second quarter, there are two matters that I want to highlight: first, we changed how we present the results of our strategic investment activities. Consistence with how we now evaluate operating performance and allocate resources, we took those investments activities out of operations and now separately present them below operating income on an investment line. This primarily relates to Risk Capital Holdings, which was previously included in the Risk and Insurance Services segment, and also includes a small amount of investments in the Risk Consulting and Technology segment. A summary of our results that reflects the change in presentation since the first quarter of 2007 is included in the supplemental information in our press release, schedule on page 13. Secondly, last quarter, you will recall that MMC performed an interim assessment on the goodwill ascribed to the Risk Consulting and Technology segment. And that interim assessment required a non-cash accounting impairment charge in the first quarter. We indicated then that we would perform the more comprehensive step two phase of the assessment required by the accounting rules in this second quarter. And our results for this quarter include an additional charge of $115 million or $0.22 per share. In sum, the total accounting impairment charge taken in the first half of the 2008 amounts to $540 million or $1.04 a share. There is no tax benefit relating to this charge nor any impact on MMC's cash flows, tangible equity, or any consequence to its outstanding debt covenants. Let me now take you through MMC's second quarter earnings per share, looked at on a non-GAAP basis. Please refer to schedules 10 through 12 in our press release for reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP numbers that I'll be referring to. We start with EPS from continuing operations of $0.11. We do not include the $0.02 of income from discontinued operations in the quarter. Noteworthy items in this quarter, primarily restructuring, totaled $63 million or $0.08, which we add back for non-GAAP purposes. The impact of the accounting impairment charge, as I just indicated, was $0.22, another add back. As a result, we view non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter of 2008 as $0.41 compared with non-GAAP EPS of $0.35 in the second quarter of 2007. This represents an increase of 17% year-over-year. Notably, this strong growth was achieved despite a substantial negative swing in earnings at Risk Capital Holdings, which had a year-over-year impact negatively on EPS of $0.06. I should note here also that from where we now sit, Risk Capital Holdings is expected to show a loss in the third quarter this year as well in the range of the loss for this quarter. Note that this is well below the $ 74 million gain that RCH produced in last year's third quarter. Looking at MMC's overall financial performance in Q2, it was very strong, on both top and bottom lines, reflecting the net benefits of a diversified portfolio of businesses. MMC had strong revenue growth across reporting segments in difficult operating environments. In the second quarter, consolidated revenue rose 9% to $3 billion, driven by solid growth at Marsh, Mercer and Kroll, and the revenue growth on an underlying basis as indicated in the press release was 4%. Turning now to the segments. Revenue for the Risk and Insurance Services segment grew 5% or 1% on an underlying basis. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income at Risk and Insurance Services rose $92 million from $115 million in last year's Q2 to $207 million this year. For the six months to-date, the non-GAAP operating margin for Risk and Insurance Services increased from 13.2% to 16.2%. This is an impressive improvement in the operating margin, even including the hurdle of not insignificant... of a not insignificant decline in fiduciary income in the quarter. Now within the segment, results for the quarter were strong at Marsh, and all indicators are positive. Revenue increased 8% to $1.2 billion or 3% on an underlying basis. Marsh's underlying client revenue retention rates, which measure the dollar amount of client revenue retained from the prior year, also improved for the second consecutive quarter, and are now within the range we experienced in the last extended soft market. New business remains robust with year-over-year growth in each of the past nine quarters. Although helped by organic revenue growth, Marsh is improving profitability mainly through expense reduction and cost discipline. These have driven a significant decline in other operating expenses on a year-over-year basis. In fact, Marsh, in the second quarter, saw its 3% organic revenue growth while holding underlying expenses down to 5% growth on... while holding underlying expenses down 5% on a non-GAAP basis. The impact on profitability is telling. Modest underlying revenue growth, coupled with stronger expense discipline, increased Marsh's operating margin through the first six months of 2008 by about 500 basis points, on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. Now, the third quarter is Marsh's latest revenue quarter. So its margin will not be as strong as you have seen in the first half of year. However, we do expect to see significant improvement in margin in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. By any measure, Marsh's performance is much improved this year. Turning now to our reinsurance broking operations, reinsurance rates have continued to decline, as you well know, and this trend continued through the July renewals. As discussed in the first quarter, Carpenter embarked on and has now almost fully executed a restructuring program to improve its profitability against this backdrop of declining rates. The workforce has been reduced by over 300 or more than 10% at a cost $30 million, with annualized savings of $40 million. More generally, on a non- GAAP basis, second quarter operating expense, apart from restructuring charges, declined commensurate with the quarterly decline in revenue. Turning now to Consulting; growth in both revenue and operating income, as indicated by Brian, was led by Mercer. Mercer's overall revenue performance was impressive, especially given the current economic environment, 14% growth on a reported basis and 9% underlying. Moreover and encouragingly, each of Mercer's businesses generated underlying revenue growth. And Mercer's second quarter operating income rose 11% on a GAAP basis and 9% non-GAAP. Oliver Wyman's results in the quarter were negatively affected by client responses to adverse economic conditions, particularly in the U.S. Revenue growth decelerated. Oliver Wyman's reported revenue growth was 10% in the second quarter and 11% for the first half of '08. On an underlying basis, revenue growth was 2% in the quarter and 4% for the first six months. And because revenue growth has declined more quickly than even than anticipated, Oliver Wyman has seen a marked decrease in profitability this year. As a consequence, specific steps have been implemented and are being implemented to reduce operating expenses across operations. Revenue for the Risk Consulting and Technology segment rose 13% with underlying growth at 6%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income for Risk Consulting and Technology rose 10% from $30 million to $33 million. Kroll, which represents 85% of the revenue in this segment, had a very strong quarter both in terms of revenue as well as operating income. Kroll's revenue of $240 million reflected underlying growth of 11%. Its litigation support and data recovery business had very strong growth with underlying revenue up 21,% driven by growth at Ontrack. Kroll's risk mitigation and response unit also had strong revenue growth, up 20% on an underlying basis, driven by solid growth at the business intelligence unit. The other unit in the segment, the corporate advisory and restructuring group, which was separated operationally from Kroll in Q1 saw its revenue decline 13%. It should be noted that CARG, the restructuring group, which last year had a solid operating margin, swung to a loss in this year's Q2, which makes Kroll's performance in the segment that much more impressive. A word on our financial condition and our increasing financial flexibility before I close. We ended the second quarter with $1.2 billion in cash. The final compensation fund payment of $170 million was made this past June. And as you know, our cash generation typically accelerates in the second half of the year and we do not have any additional debt maturing until June 2009. And our defined benefit retirement plans in the U.S. and the UK, despite recent equity market declines, continue to be over-funded. Net debt was $2.4 billion at the end of the quarter, a significant decrease from $3.8 billion at the end of the second quarter of '07, which continues the significant deleveraging of our balance sheet begun three years ago. Finally, please note that our share count on a fully diluted basis has decreased by 40 million shares from the second quarter of 2007. The quarter-end count now fully reflects the 48 million shares received from both of our accelerated share repurchase programs initiated in 2007, with the final tranche of almost the 11 million shares delivered to us in March of this year. With that, let me turn it over to Dan for an update on Marsh.
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: Thank you, Matt. And good morning everyone. I am pleased with the performance of Marsh for the second quarter. We have a long way to go with our results this quarter reflects strong progress on many funds. Today, I will take a few minutes to review the quarter and share some of the actions we are taking to continue to improve our financial performance. Marsh grew revenue by 8%, 3% on an underlying basis. This underlying growth was broad-based. EMEA was up 5%, Asia-Pacific grew 8%, Latin America rose 1%, and U.S. and Canada increased 1%. While revenue was up 8%, our expenses on a GAAP basis were flat, and on an underlying basis were down 5%, driving a significant improvement in our margin in Q2 compared with the second quarter of last year. In fact, we earned materially more in the first six months of this year than we earned for all of 2007. On a non-GAAP basis, Marsh's net operating income in the second quarter increased by more than $90 million from the second quarter of 2007. For the first six months of 2008, the increase was over $130 million. I'm pleased with these results and they reflect a significant improvement in our performance just a short time ago. Our new business was up 6% or 3% on an underlying basis in the quarter, led by a solid performance in our international operations. These levels of new business demonstrate that we continue to win in the marketplace. Year-to-date, we have generated $466 million of new business, an increase of 11% on a GAAP basis and 5% on an underlying basis from last year. Also, we have seen meaningful across the board improvements in our client revenue retention rates. On a global basis, through the first six months, our client revenue retention rate has improved five percentage points compared with the second half of last year. I feel good about our revenue performance in the second quarter. We are winning in the marketplace and we have clearly gained momentum. I am also pleased with the greatly improved morale and how the organization has responded to our drive for greater expense discipline, defined by our mantra, Think like an Owner. As I mentioned earlier, our expenses in the quarter were flat compared with last year and this includes $22 million in severance charges related to position eliminations in the quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, underlying expenses were down 5%. This reflects the benefit of a much greater cost discipline on many fronts. We are holding our managers much more accountable for expense control at a very detailed level, which is contributing to the significant cost reductions. Our other operating expenses fell 15% in the quarter with decline showing in many areas, as we cut down on spending, not specifically tied to better servicing of clients. As examples, we are seeing significant reductions in marketing and advertising, nonessential internal meetings, and consulting fees. In addition to cutting spending, we have also reduced staff. In Q2, we eliminated approximately 360 positions. This was in addition to the 150 positions that were eliminated in the first quarter. Total restructuring costs so far this year have been $36 million, which will result in annualized savings of more than $45 million. At the beginning of July, we completed our outsourcing arrangement for back office functions in the UK. As part of this transaction, about 600 Marsh employees have been transferred to Capita Group. This transaction will reduce our operating costs and improve the quality of our service. My team and I have also completed plans for additional reductions. The cuts largely will come from corporate, back office operations, and non-client facing areas. We will also see reductions as a result of the operating model changes we are making in our U.S. business. We're being surgical with these reductions, which will be largely executed this year and will result in an additional 900 position eliminations, a potion of which will come from attrition and further outsourcing. As with revenue growth, it is early days in terms of expense control, while we are starting to see the benefits. We view this as a multi-year process that will greatly improve our competitive position and significantly increase profitability. Now let me give you the broad outlines of our improvement plans. We have already completed what I'd like to call the first wave of these plans. We established the senior management team. We reorganized Marsh's global organizational structure. We streamlined reporting relationships and we established better P&L accountability with managers while sharpening our focus on clients and colleagues. Since these early steps, we have diagnosed our most critical performance issues and developed plans for further improvement. These plans are aimed primarily at improving our operations in the United States and continuing to position ourselves for growth and margin expansion internationally. We are now in the early stages of the second wave of operational improvements and major initiatives that will include the following: fundamentally changing our operating model in the U.S. through segmentation and placement hubs; pricing and services discipline; enhanced commissions; international expansion; and continuation of expense reductions. Let me touch on a few of these. Client segmentation, a new U.S. operating model built around a more segmented approach to business development and servicing our clients will better position us for growth and further margin expansion in the future. We will do this by developing service platforms and operating approaches for different client segments. Large global clients require a different level of service than our middle market and small clients do. Although the organization previously attempted to pursue a more segmented approach through its middle market initiative, we never fully developed differentiated service offerings for our segments. We will do this now. Hubs. We will establish placement hubs as part of our new U.S. operating model. The hubs will add value to clients, carriers and to Marsh. International expansion; our plans for earnings growth and margin expansion in our international business fall into two categories. The first is driving margin expansion in some of our larger markets. The second is to position ourselves for continued growth in emerging markets and other economies where economic growth and our strong position provide opportunity for further expansion. Our international results in the second quarter provide evidence of the opportunity and our early progress. As I said, I am pleased with the progress we are making. Our trends are improving and we are gaining momentum. Morale is excellent. The response of our colleagues globally has been outstanding and I couldn't be more proud of our team. We are instituting a culture of cost discipline, one where colleagues think like owners before committing Marsh's resources. At the same time, feedback from our clients has been extremely satisfying. They understand what we are doing. And they agree with the massage that we need to be fairly compensated for the value of the work we do. However, I want to make sure you understand that although the news is good, we still have long way to go before we can say that our business is where we want it to be. The market continues to be challenging and we still have a lot of work to do to create a more disciplined sales and growth-oriented culture that will drive more consistency in our top line results. However, I am confident that we will continue to engineer a significant improvement in Marsh over the next couple of years. Thank you. And I look forward to updating you on our progress over the next several quarters. And with that, I will turn it back to Brian.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Dan, thanks, Matt. Now I would like to begin our Q&A. So, and as a reminder, we have our operating company CEOs here with us who can help answer any questions you have. So operator, we are ready to begin the Q&A. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the question and answer session will be conducted electronically today [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Keith Walsh with Citi.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup: Good morning, gentlemen. First question just for Dan. When I think about, I guess, the Americas' roughly 35% to 40% in revenues total, it seems like you are talking... you are going in surgically to take cost out. Maybe if you could even whittle that down, is there a subsegment within the Americas that is really where the problems are, if you can just give us some color around that? Thanks.
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: Okay, thanks, Keith. A couple of things. One, when we look at the 900 job cuts, let's bear in mind first of all that about 200 of those roles will be outsourced and we will probably have another 100 or so, which will manage via attrition. So the lion's share of the remaining exits within that will be in the United States. We had several parts of our business where I feel that we can reduce expense and reduce our employee account without affecting client revenue at all. To give you some examples, in the second quarter, we eliminated a group which we call the Policy Management Group, which was set up only two or three years ago as a policy checking, policy issuance area. But as you know, a big part of our business is in the large account space and most of those policies are manuscripted and bespoke. And so it added redundancies because clearly the client team has to review a bespoke policy and take responsibility for that. And all it all did was sort of add cost as we sent those policies to a central location and it added time as well in terms of our ability to deliver timely policies. And so that was about 200 headcount right in that group. When you look at our business, our approach in the past has very much been a one side fits all strategy in terms of service and account handling. And so when you look at that and since our tradition is a large account area tradition, what it tends to mean is that we do better in the large account space, and as we drift through middle market and into small, we struggle on the efficiency side and on the cost side because we are giving large account solutions to customers that are really looking at... looking for a broad and comprehensive products rather than bespoke solutions. So if we have a focus, it will be more in that middle and small area.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup: And just a follow-up with the placement hubs, may be if you can give us a little more color around timing and magnitude of how beneficial that could be? And that's it, thanks.
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: Okay. Where we are today, we have distributed placement. So that means that in about 60 offices we are doing property and casualty placement activities. And you could imagine we've got a great deal of variability with that. We have offices that have a great deal of volume and they do a terrific job. We have other offices which have very limited placement volume, but yet they are maintaining placement organization. So, in my mind, hubbing placement is absolutely critical to the delivery of the absolute best terms and conditions available in the marketplace for our clients. And so, I think it would be a... concentrating that placement and product expertise will be a big win for our clients. And we'll help on some industry issues, for example, like improving contract certainty performance, which is a big issue and we have made a lot of progress in the UK and I think we can do the same thing in the U.S. I also think carriers will benefit from hubs. The reality is, most carriers don't have as distributed in underwriting platform as we have a distribution platform. And so we've heard very good feedback from carriers about organizing around our hubs, which will make them more efficient and save cost. That will give us some ability to work together to create things like standardized submissions and gain efficiencies that way. And of course, for us, removing some of the variability and focusing our placement personnel in a more controlled environment will lower our cost and will reduce our E&O exposure. And it would also enable us to focus some of our technology expenditure on improving the whole placement process.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup: Great, thanks a lot.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Next question please?
Operator: Our next question will come from Meyer Shields. Sir, please state your name or your company name.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Stifel Nicolaus. Good morning everyone.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: I guess another question for Dan, if I can start with that. Obviously pushing for higher revenue for those commissions and fees is going to be a permanent process, but can you give us some insight in terms of how far along you are compared to where you should be at this point in time?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: Well, I am happy with 3% organic growth in the quarter and unhappy with some of the progress we've made in the U.S. We're starting... a lot comes with confidence. A lot comes with how people feel about themselves, how they feel about the company. And when they feel good about the stability in the firm and that the company is on the front foot, they feel a lot more confident to ask their client for a fee review, as an example. Some of the things that we're seeking on the fee side, as an example, I think are pretty standard in other businesses along the lines of, let's say, inflation adjustments. There are too many clients that have a philosophical problem with having an adjustment base upon inflation built in to our contract with them. We have all kinds of different ways, in my mind, in order to grow revenue. I think our segmentation strategies will enable us to grow revenue. I think our placement hubs will make us more competitive in the market and we'll win more deals. Right now there has been a shift in the last six or seven months toward offensive RFPs as opposed to defensive RFPs. And right now in the United States more than... almost 80% of our RFP activity is on offense as opposed to playing defense. So that's a fundamental shift from were we've been over the last few years. And in terms of enhancing the, what we call our pricing of services, a lot of that is our looking at the way we do business, I have been very cheered as I have gone around the country, with how many clients have said that we offer terrific value and terrific services. And then they fundamentally rely on Marsh on a strategic basis. I think that puts us in a good position, have a discussion with regard to the compensation.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And just quick follow-up for Matt. Can you give us the impact of foreign exchange on, I guess, EPS and the brokerage margin?
Matthew B. Bartley - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It was not significant. So I would say we got a slight benefit, some of our competitors show pretty substantial benefit, but ours doesn't approach that. So both on an aggregate basis and specifically in the Risk and Insurance Services segment, it was a bit more than de minimis although we have a discussion about whether that's the right term, but very slight.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Next question please.
Operator: Our next question will come from Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney. Please state your name and company name before posing your question.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Thanks. Actually my question was answered.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Larry. Next please?
Operator: Our next question will come from Mathew Heimermann with JPMorgan. Please state your name and company name before posing your question.
Mathew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Hi, Matt Heimermann, JPMorgan. Good morning everybody.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning
Mathew Heimermann - JPMorgan: First on Oliver Wyman, I guess, could you just talk maybe a little bit about what you're seeing in the pipeline, because I would suspect that you have some visibility with revenues. So is the pipeline slowing even faster, I guess, or more dramatically then we are seeing in the reported organic at this point?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: I am going to let John answer that question. John?
John Drzik - President and Chief Executive Officer of Oliver Wyman: Sure. We are seeing continued headwinds in the pipeline for the second half of the year, probably comparable to what we had for the first half of the year rather than better or worst at this stage.
Mathew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Okay. And then just in terms of, is that... I mean, with the discussion that you are seeing signs of Europe weakening, is that just U.S... you have seen the worst of the U.S. at this point?
John Drzik - President and Chief Executive Officer of Oliver Wyman: I think our business follows the broader economic pattern. So as right now, the U.S. is the weakest economy. And that's where our business is weakest. We are expecting that some of that may move into Europe, and we are seeing some early signs of that. But that may be balanced by some recovery in the U.S. business. So right now we are not seeing the business in aggregate looking to be worse than it's been. But because of the spread, it may... there may be continue headwinds in the global business for some period of time.
Mathew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Okay. And then just a follow-up for Dan was just, I think somebody suggested that retention was near historical levels, if I didn't know that was... if I heard that right and if it wasn't, if no one opined on it, could you just talk about where retention levels are versus history at this point?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: Okay. So, let me approach that in two different ways. We tend to manage to client revenue retention. And on our the point that Matt made was the client revenue retention levels are at the historical soft market level. So the comparison would be when we look at some of the soft market conditions in the late '90s that would be the comparison with that. From a account retention level, which we don't think is as meaningful for a variety of reasons to manage to, but I am also pleased to say that our account retention levels, both in the U.S./Canada division and internationally, are at historical norms which are in the low to mid 90s, depending on geography.
Mathew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Okay. And then could you maybe give us a sense of what the spread is between soft market and hard market retention?
Matthew B. Bartley - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It's a couple of percentage points. And it depends upon what point you are in the cycle. So the reference that I made was an extended soft market where you really felt the brunt of the soft market play through over a period of time. But it's a couple of percentage points.
Mathew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you very much.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: You are welcome. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jay Gelb. Please state the your name and company name please.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Hello, it's Jay Gelb from Lehman. I was wondering if you could sort of break down first the anticipated expanse savings as a result of the restructuring in Marsh and then what the offsetting expanse... what the offsetting investments would be, so kind of a net level of expense reductions?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: Yes, I can very much understand the question, Jay. I can't answer it in full, but I will answer it in part. As you now, when we look back a little bit in Q4, we had disclosed that we were going to achieve about $125 million of expense savings and at that time we said a fair amount of that, a heavier amount of that would roll back in through inflation area adjustments, through comp and other activities. And so I imagine that's a part of what underpins your question. But let me address it this way. In addition to that $125 million through this year, we've made significant changes to our expense policies, as an example, our T&E policy. And we expect to see about $25 million of benefits on that through 2008. When we look on a year-to-date basis, we've eliminated 500 positions and we've outsourced 600 employees to Capita in the U.K. The year-to-date restructuring has been $36 million and the annualized run rate savings from that is $45 million. As we move through the rest of year and the balance of the restructurings that we do, we expect the proportionality to be similar.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Yes, yes, okay. And then if we look at the overall Risk and Insurance segment, I think 20% pre-tax margin was put out there as a reasonable goal. At what point do you think you can get there?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: I am not sure who made that goal that day, but --
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: May be an older one?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, may be. I think for us... we have like a two-step process and one of them is to get us competitive, to get us at levels that the competition is achieving. When we get there, then we go to the next step, which is to beat the competition. So whatever that is, it is.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then just for Michele, what type of margins do you think the Consulting segment can generate in this type of economic environment?
M. Michele Burns - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mercer: In this economic environment, we probably are in this low to, say, mid-teen range. Over time, as we continue to grow the firm and scale certain of the businesses, I think you will see that we can achieve mid to high-teen ranges on the margin line. And particularly it takes effect as our outsourcing business, which is becoming more and more significant, continues to scale. Similarly, our investment management business, as it continues to scale, it will improve the margin as well. So I would expect over a longer time horizon, you'd see margin improvement that will be marked.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Thanks very much.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, you are welcome. Next question please?
Operator: Next we will hear from Alain Karaoglan. Please take your name and company name.
Alain Karaoglan - Banc of America Securities: Good morning. It's Alain Karaoglan with Banc of America. Congratulations on the nice improvements in results this quarter.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Alain Karaoglan - Banc of America Securities: Dan, in your comments you mentioned you have a long way to go for business to be where you'd want to be. And maybe if I could ask that question to both Dan and Brian, where do you want to be and is there a timeframe by which you want to get there? What were you thinking about when you made that comment and what sort of timeframe do you think about? And you might still be reluctant, Brian, to mention any financial metrics that these relate to, but I don't know if you have fine-tuned your thinking on that or not?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Dan, do you want to start?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: Yes, I will start. One, I am a firm believer that you are never done. There is always a smarter way of doing something, there is more margin to achieve. So we're not going to get to a point and stop and say we are there and get complacent. We clearly have had underperforming margins. So over... I think a reasonable period to look at when you are taking a business and driving margin improvement is over a two to three-year period, you are going to drive some fundamental changes and then you are going to make further changes from there. So at the end, I think you will see some significant improvement in our margins as we go through this year, might expect that to continue next year as well. And as we go forward, I really think in 2010 and beyond, we'll be looking to optimize parts of our business. I've always believed Marsh is the finest insurance brokerage firm in the world and there is a great deal of opportunity for us. And I wouldn't trade our strategic position with anyone.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Dan, it's tough to top that, I think you said it all.
Alain Karaoglan - Banc of America Securities: Thank you.
Operator: Jay Cohen has our next question; please state your name and company name.
Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch: Jay Cohen from Merrill Lynch. I have one question and a follow-up, I guess both relatively simple, I think. The first one, the tax rate on sort of the adjusted earnings, looks like it was down 200 to 300 basis points from the first quarter, and I am wondering what was the cause of that.
Matthew B. Bartley - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The tax rate this quarter was benefited, Jay, from the geographic mix of earnings. Normally when you see a move, I think the move is a little bit less than the one that you articulated or enumerated there. But normally when you see a move like that, there is something else going on. But here it was really the geographic mix that helped us considerably. Now, the benefit that we got on tax line, we kicked away a little bit, you may have noted on the cooperate line, where we had some incremental expenses in the quarter that we do not expect to recur. So net-net, we probably didn't benefit any on a net basis through EPS, but it was purely the geographic mix of earnings.
Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch: That's helpful. And then lastly, maybe for Brian, the company has done a pretty good job of managing capital, meaning, buyback stock, frankly, over the last several years. And I am wondering, my sense is that you historically have not been a big believer in buybacks, but I am wondering with Marsh and given the strong cash flow, what your feeling is on that?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, just an unfair reputation I have. I think it really is the question of what's the best use of the capital. And we are constantly looking for places to grow, organic and through acquisitions. And so, that does have my priority, but that doesn't mean we wouldn't buyback shares if we felt that... at that moment the best use of the capital was to buyback shares. And I have in the past done that in a former life. But my priorities would be to try to find ways within the business to grow it.
Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch: Good. Thanks. Brian.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Next question please.
Operator: Next we'll hear from Brian Meredith. Please state your name and company name.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Brian Meredith at UBS. Two question here for you. First, Matt; can you tell us what the year-over-year benefit was from lower pension expenses, if there was any this quarter? And then also the variable comp situation on a year-over-year basis?
Matthew B. Bartley - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, the pension expense, similar to what we discussed on the first quarter, we're in the range of $30 million give or take a little bit in the quarter as a benefit year-over-year. And obviously some of that flows to Marsh, but it is also spread among a number of the other operating units. And so that hasn't changed, and we'll see that play out through the year. I am sorry, the second question was around variable comp?
Brian Meredith - UBS: Last quarter you said it was off set by variable comp?
Matthew B. Bartley - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, oh, in fact, that's right. A similar situation happening in this quarter as well, okay, again on a year-over-year basis. Now that will fall away in Q3 and Q4.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Okay, great. And the second question for Dan. I guess, question on the placement hubs. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how is this different from what global broking used to be at Marsh, or is it going back to somewhat that kind of a strategy?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: Well, the placement hubs, in my view, are very much to organize ourselves, to concentrate placement capability. But we are not going to run them as a separate profit center. They are going to be part of our geography. And it's almost like a placement utility as opposed to a placement profit center. And I am a big believer in one client at a time. So there will be no sense of aggregating our clients into the hub. We are aggregating our capability, and each client will come in as an individual and they will have the same placement team year-over-year. And so, it won't be homogenized, it would actually be very specific to individual clients. So it's a far different approach.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Okay. And you don't anticipate clients being a little bit worried by this?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: No, actually I have gotten really good feedback from clients to-date. I think what... where you'll see things, the company is largely hubbed in several of our key specialties right now. Most of our excess casualty business is placed out of New York, most of our financial lines business has three locations in the country. And so all we are doing is recognizing that model and solidifying it and making it part of a Marsh model as opposed to where the business as individual units had created on their own. We are just trying to put some hest behind it.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Perfect. Thank you.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. You are welcome. Next question please.
Operator: Next question will be Bill Wilt. Please state your name and company name.
Bill Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Hi, Bill Wilt from Morgan Stanley. Most of my questions have been asked, I just wanted to check back, Matt, in your prepared remarks side, I was writing perhaps too quickly. You commented on Marsh's revenues in the third quarter and if I wrote it down correctly, you though revenues would be or may the second half would slow. Perhaps you could just revisit, I think you commented on margin improvement in the third quarter and then revenues in the second half '08.
Matthew B. Bartley - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I was probably speaking too quickly rather than you writing too quickly, Bill. What I said or what I hoped to indicate there was that the third quarter for Marsh is seasonally a light quarter, and as a consequence, we won't see the same sort of margin on an absolute basis out of the Risk and Insurance Services segment driven by Marsh in Q3 that we've seen in Qs 1 and 2. Not the case in Q4. Q4 is again a heavy revenue quarter. But Q3 is always a bit light and so on an absolute basis, we'll see the margin come down. However, we will see significant margin improvement in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. That's our anticipation.
Bill Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Very helpful. Thank you.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: You are welcome. Thank you.
Operator: Our final question today will be a follow-up from Meyer Shields. Once again please state your name and company name.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Meyer Shields from Stifel Nicolaus. I guess a question for Dan, with regards to the hearings going on in New York. Right now, in the absence of full transparency, do feel like that's actually causing you either accounts or revenue when some of your competitors don't have to fully disclose the total revenues?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: It is a good question. And I would pair contingent commissions and transparency as really what creates an unleveled playing field. And while I wouldn't cite specific accounts, I would say that I do feel that we are competitively disadvantaged from that unleveled playing field. Disadvantage both on the revenue side, on the margin side, and also on the cost side because of the various monetary and compliance regimes we have that other companies don't bear. And so I am quite enthusiastic that these hearings have been held. I really applaud the Insurance Commissioner and Attorney General Cuomo for tackling an issue which they've inherited, much like we've inherited. And I think regardless of the outcome, I would imagine a level playing field have to be viewed by all as being what is the right environment to operate in. And I am comfortable in our position that we would do quite well competing on any basis as long as it's level.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Okay. And if I can follow that up, you talked about improved reinsurance new business generation, is that a shift in retention levels of those new clients you talked about, what's actually driving that?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Peter?
Peter Zaffino - President and Chief Executive Officer of Guy Carpenter: Yes, what Brian had mentioned in his opening statement about Guy Carpenter is that we monitor RFP activity from new opportunities. And when measured through the first two quarters, our activity has increased and our actual success ratio has gone up over 30%. And with how we account for revenue, a lot of this is done well in advance. So it's going to be mostly January 1 renewals of 2009. But we're very encouraged globally on the increased activity and the increase in our success ratio.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Well, thank you very much. I think we can draw this thing to a close. Thank you very much for calling in today.
Operator: And that does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you all for joining, have a wonderful day.

Please refer to MMC's most recent SEC filings, as well as the Company's earnings release, which are available on the MMC website for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. Now at this time I'll turn the call over to Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC. Please go ahead sir.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discus our first quarter results reported earlier today. I am Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me in presenting on the call today are Matt Bartley our CFO, and Michele Burns, CEO of Mercer. After I make some brief remarks Matt will present our financial results and Michele will share with you her insights into Mercer's strong performance during the quarter. I'd also like to welcome our operating company's CEO's to today's call; Dan Glaser from Marsh, Peter Zeffino, from Guy Carpenter, John Drzik from Oliver Wyman, and Ben Allen from Kroll. Also with us is Mike Bischoff, our Head of Investor Relations. They will be available to you during the Q&A portion of our call. I'd like to start-off by saying it has been a very busy quarter for us at MMC. I'd been on the job just about 100 days and we have accomplished a lot in this short period of time. I'd like to walk you through some of the specific actions taken since our last earnings call in February. On that call I admitted MMC just two weeks, I gave you my initial impression of MMC's operating and financial performance, and I said that while there are businesses in MMC that are doing well, the company as a whole was not performing at acceptable levels. We acknowledge a serious work would be needed... needed to be done to fix the parts that aren't performing. These issues reside primarily in Marsh and Kroll and I would like to quickly touch on these two businesses now. In the first quarter, performance at Marsh began to show signs of improvement. Marsh's first quarter revenues increased 7% to $1.2 billion. On an underlying basis, growth was 1%, a continuation of the positive growth we saw in the fourth quarter. Global client revenue increased 2% on an underlying basis, and this was achieved in a pricing environment that shows significant declines in the P&C commercial insurance marketplace. The strong new business results seen over the last two years continued as Marsh achieved 10% increase in new business in the quarter on an underlying basis. This growth was experienced in the U.S and Canada 13%, in EMEA 2%, Asia-Pacific was 44%, and the Latin America 2%. Client revenue retention also improved over the first quarter of last year, especially in the U.S and UK, our two largest geographies. This was in spite of pricing declines in the insurance marketplace which were worse year-over-year and sequentially. Another positive from Marsh was that while revenue grew 7%, expenses grew only 3%. On an underlying basis revenue increase 1% while expenses declined 2%. This decline was achieved even though Marsh's variable compensation increased by $30 million on a year-over-year basis. The variable compensation increase primarily was due to a timing change of accrual, which began in the third quarter of last year, as well as an increase in the amount of Marsh's bonus pool. This increase essentially offset lower pension expense in the quarter. Overall market... Marsh achieved significant margin improvement as its GAAP operating margin increased 350 basis points and non-GAAP improved 250 basis points, compared with last year's first quarter. As you know the first quarter is typically the highest margin quarter of the year for Marsh, however, this type of margin improvement is what we are targeting for the remainder of the year. While I'm pleased to see evidence of cost containment, we are continuing to implement vigorous expense disciplined in Marsh in order to achieve even greater long-term margin improvement. So as we look at Marsh, we know there's still... we still have a lot of work ahead of us, but we are pleased that the actions we've taken today that are beginning to generate positive results. Turning to Kroll, when Kroll was acquired in July 2004, the plan was to combine it with other MMC operations and realize meaningful synergies. That envisioned integration was never completed. However... and certain businesses of Kroll have been underperforming since that time. As we reported this morning we incurred a non-cash impairment charge of $425 million related to Kroll goodwill. As I said in February, Kroll is a very complicated company. During the quarter I began to peel back the layers at Kroll and I have concluded that there are several lines of business that fit into the long-term MMC portfolio and others that simply do not. Examples of businesses with long-term potential in MMC are on track, which provides litigation support and data recovery services, background screening, which provides employments screening and identity theft services and the business intelligent... intelligence and investigations operation, which provides risks litigation and response services. These are the businesses I see as core Kroll, and in these businesses Kroll is a world leader. To increase our focus on these operations, I named Ben Allen, CEO of Kroll in March. He is charged with realizing the growth potential of these core Kroll businesses and maximizing their value to MMC. As part of my evaluation I also recognized early on corporate restructuring would benefit from separate management. As a result the Corporate Advisory and Restructuring Group was carved out as a separate group now headed by Simon Freakley. Therefore, for the first time this quarter corporate restructuring is disclosed as a separate business within the risk consulting and technology segment. This business has not been a strong performer in recent quarters. However, it is one that better in times of economy uncertainty, and given today's climate we want this business to be well positioned to capitalize on any increase in the Corporate Advisory and Restructuring sector. To that end, three distinct groups within this business are being combined into a single operation with global reach and scale. Now let me discuss the rest of Kroll. There are businesses in Kroll that do not necessarily fit into MMC's long-term growth plans. Some examples here include Factual Data Corp, which among other things provide services to mortgage lenders, and the government services business. These are businesses that we have determined are not a strong strategic fit, it may have greater value outside of MMC and which along with Corporate Advisory and Restructuring drove the impairment charge recorded this quarter. We will seek ways to divest these businesses in ways consistent with enchaining shareholder value. Finally, an overall atmosphere of cost discipline is being in still to improve profitability at Kroll including selective staff reductions. Now in addition to focusing on Marsh and Kroll, we are taking additional actions to appropriately position MMC both in the current operating environment and for greater success in the future. At Guy Carpenter, we face increasingly difficult market conditions. Performance in the quarter was weaker than expected with significant rate decreases across most classes of business and a decline in net new business. We therefore move quickly to take steps of repositioning Guy Carpenter in the current environment and to improve... to improve profitability. First, surely after I arrived in February I appointed Peter Zaffino, as CEO and Britt Newhouse as Chairman. Peter and Britt have significant history within not only the insurance industry, but also within Guy Carpenter. Second, under this new leadership team we move quickly to reduce costs. Over the past several weeks Carpenter's new management has taken actions to restructure its business across geographies. In the second quarter, Carpenter's reducing its global workforce by over 300 or more than 10%. The anticipated cost is approximately $30 million with annual savings of $40 million. These reductions are being done with great care and precision, so they do not effect Carpenter's strength and client capabilities. Michele will be discussing Mercer in detail in a few minutes. Overall Mercer continued its recent trend of strong revenue and operating income growth. With regards to Oliver Wyman, which makes up the rest of the consulting segment, underlined growth slow to 6% from the double-digit growth we've seen over the past four years. This slowdown primarily is due to a weakening of demand from U.S based clients adopting a cautious stance in the face of a weak U.S economic environment. Indeed, strong demand persist from clients outside the US. In light of continued macro economic uncertainty Oliver Wyman, is vigilantly managing its expense base to align it with the emerging revenue picture. And finally, at the corporate center, where we have seen marginal improvement in the run rate cost over the past several months, I've commissioned a review to examine all corporate functions and determine if they are appropriately sized and structured. These are some of the detailed actions that have taken place in MMC so far and during the short period of time this year. Our work is ongoing; I also continue to gather more information each day about MMC, I've traveled extensively in the United States, visiting with employees, our major shareholders, and with current and perspective clients to discuss what MMC can do for them. The intelligence and feedback I gleaned from all these meetings has been invaluable. While there is a lot of work ahead of us, I'm convinced that MMC has tremendous potential that can be realized to the benefit of our clients, our shareholders and our employees. And with that, I'll turn it over to Matt to present our financial results for the quarter.
Matthew B. Bartley - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by giving you some additional information regarding the Kroll goodwill, impairment, assessment, and charge that we announced in this mornings press release. The Q1 decision to make organizational changes within the risk consulting and technology segment to reorganize the reporting units within the segment was a triggering event under the accounting rules applicable to goodwill. We perform the interim assessment of the segment goodwill at quarter close determined that the goodwill was impaired and as a result recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $425 million or $0.81 per share. As noted in the release, this charge has no impact on tangible equity or on our debt covenants and of course as just indicated is non-cash. This amount represents our best estimate of the goodwill impairment at March 31. We will be completing the more comprehensive step two phase of the assessment in the second quarter to determine if any further adjustment is required. The second step will lightly result in some refinement in the goodwill impairment charge either an increase or a reduction in the level of goodwill impairment and we expect to reflect that any further adjustment in the second quarter results. Now let me take you through MMC's first quarter operating results excluding this charge. Earnings per share was $0.41 including income from discontinued operations of one penny reflecting the sale of a Marsh claims administration operation in Brazil. That compares with $0.47 in the first quarter of 2007. Noteworthy items, which are highlighted on page 9 of the press release, totaled $49 million in the quarter excluding the goodwill impairment charge. These expenses are primarily restructuring charges from previously disclosed and ongoing cost reduction initiatives at Marsh and at the parent company at Corporate. In total, we look at our results from operations for the first quarter of '08 on a non-GAAP basis to be $0.46. The difference from last year's first quarter can be largely attributed to a decline of $43 million in revenue at risk capital holdings or approximately $0.05 of earnings. Before I continue my discussion of segment results, let me make a few comments about a number of enhancements and additional disclosures that we show in this morning's press release and will show going forward. We have added information regarding the revenue breakdown of certain components of MMC's segments. For example, we have expanded Marsh's geographic breakdown reflecting the manner in which Marsh manages its global insurance broking operations. Similarly, we now breakout Mercer's revenues into consulting, outsourcing, and investment consulting and management, reflecting the way Mercer differentiates its client services in the marketplace. We also provide the component parts of Mercer consulting, retirement, health and benefits, and the other consulting lines. And within the risk and... risk consulting and technology segment we've expanded the revenue category's of Kroll to include litigation support and data recovery, background screening, and risk mitigations and response, as well as breaking out separately our Corporate Advisory and Restructuring Group. To help you with your modeling, we have reclassified 2007 quarterly revenue to match our current revenue reporting format as you can see on page 12 of the release. Also we now disclose the currency impact, the affective acquisitions and dispositions and underlying revenue growth for each of the categories I have just discussed. We have also broadened our disclosure on how we view the business through non-GAAP measures. We show the calculation of non-GAAP operating income and margin for each of MMC's segments and the reconciliation with N2 [ph] reported operating income and margins. Taken together, we believe these enchantments provide additional and helpful clarity to our... on our quarterly results. Now turning to the general financial picture and the segments in the first quarter of 2008, MMC's consolidated revenue rose 8% to $3 billion against varying marketplace conditions driven by solid growth at Marsh in the consulting segment and from parts of Kroll. On in underlying basis revenue growth in the first quarter was 2%, excluding risk capital holdings from each period underlying revenue growth year-over-year would have been 4%. Turning to our segments, risk and insurance services operating income was $240 million, a decline of $19 million or 7% compared with last year as profitability improvement at Marsh was offset by declines in operating income at Guy Carpenter and the falloff at risk capital holdings. The non-GAAP margin for risk and insurance services was 17.9% in the first quarter of '08 compared with 20.2% in Q1 of '07 reflecting again the minimal contribution from risk capital holdings in the current period. Excluding risk capital holdings, from both prior and current period, non-GAAP margins for risk and insurance services would have been 17.6% in Q1 '08 versus 17.4% in Q1 '07. Now let's turn to Marsh specifically. First quarter revenue at Marsh increased 7% to $1.2 billion on an underlying basis growth was 1% led by our international operations, which grew 3%. These growth rates include the effects of fiduciary interest income, which declined fairly significantly do to lower short-term interest rates. Consequently, client revenue not including fiduciary interest increased 2% on underlying basis. As Brian indicated Marsh also generated strong new business in the quarter, underlying growth in new business was 10% in aggregate and follows new business growth of 8% in the fourth quarter of 2007. This is the eight consecutive quarter of new business growth for Marsh. At the same time, the effects of cost discipline are also evident both in tighter control over discretionary spending and in tight controls on headcount. In fact in the period, there were about 150 headcount reductions at Marsh, and as discretionary spending, there were declined in the first quarter in T&E, meetings, marketing, advertising and facilities and equipment costs. Obviously this is the beginning of a process, but we're already started to see some of the benefits of that tighter control flowing through to margins. And we expect to see these savings continue through the course of the year. A lower level of expense was achieved in the quarter even though Marsh is variable compensation accrual increased by $30 million compared with prior year. This increase primarily was due to a change in the timing of the accounting accrual, which begin in the third quarter of last year, as well as including an increase in Marsh's overall bonus pool. A higher variable compensation accrual was essentially offset by lower pension expense this quarter. The combination of modest underlying revenue growth with stronger expense discipline improved Marsh's operating margin 350 basis points on a GAAP basis, and 250 basis points on a non-GAAP basis compared with last year's first quarter. This represents the strongest margin performance by Marsh, since the third quarter of 2004. Turning now to our reinsurance broking operations. As you know marketplace conditions continue to be very difficult. Reinsurance rates have continued to decline and we expect to see this trend continue through the rest of the year. Strong underwriting results by insurers and re-insurers have led to a higher risk retention by Carpenter's clients, on top of continued competitive pressure on reinsurance premium pricing. This environment was particularly aggressive in the U.S. for property catastrophe coverage where Guy Carpenter had a substantial market shares. These conditions coupled with a reduction in net new business contributed to reduced profitability at Guy Carpenter. Additionally Carpenter's results in Q1, include about $5 million associated with the departure of its former CEO. As Brian discussed, we are implementing a restructuring program, to improve the profitability picture at Guy Carpenter. As we look forward, we see significant improvement in Carpenter's new business pipeline. However, due to the seasonal nature of reinsurance renewals much of this new business development will not be realized until January next year. Briefly, on Risk Capital Holdings. The $43 million decline in the first quarter 2008 revenue, which is very high margin revenue, negatively effected EPS by about $0.05. In the second quarter, due to declines in the market value of publicly traded securities, in our Risk Capital Holdings investments, we expect to see revenue from RCH, potentially be negative. Now lets turn to Consulting. Consulting had a strong... had strong first quarter performance, with growth in both revenue and operating income. This was led by Mercer's Q1 revenue performance of 16% growth on a reported basis and 9% underlying, this is the highest quarterly growth rate in underlying revenue and Mercer has experienced since the fourth quarter of 2000, which is particularly impressive even in the current economic environment. At Oliver Wyman reported revenue was up 13%, underlying growth slowed from the performance we've seen over the past four years to 6%, reflecting client caution surrounding the U.S. economic environment in particular. So while our Consulting operations performed well on the top line given macroeconomic uncertainty, we are selectively implementing plans to reduce expenses in recognition of uncertain current economic conditions. Turning now to Risk Consulting & Technology, the non-cash goodwill impairment charge I discussed earlier affected only the Risk Consulting & Technology segment, I will now review the results of this segment excluding that charge. As Brian discussed our Risk Consulting & Technology segment includes both Kroll and now separately corporate advisory and restructuring. In Q1 total revenue for the segment increased 10% to $259 million underlying growth was 3%. Operating income decreased from $26 million in the first quarter of 2007 to $8 million in the current period excluding approximately $3 million of restructuring costs. In the first quarter, Kroll's reported revenue was up 14% to $220 million. On an underlying basis revenue increased 5%. Litigation, support and data recovery had good growth in the first quarter with revenue up 32% on a reported basis and 7% underlying. This increase was derived from its legal technology business both on an organic basis as well as aided by an acquisition in late 2007. Background screenings revenue decreased 2% in Q1, primarily attributable to the mortgage screening business. This was partially offset by growth in identity theft services. Risk mitigation and response had strong revenue growth in Q1, up 14% on a reported basis and 11% underlying. This was driven by the business intelligence unit, which had solid growth across all geographies. However, despite Kroll's revenue growth, its profitability was lower primarily due to the mortgage screening business. Briefly on the corporate advisory and restructuring group where revenue was down 7% in the first quarter. As economic conditions have become more challenging we have seen an increase in the demand for our services in the U.S. This was more than offset by declines in Europe, however, which has not yet seen the same ramp up in demand. In terms of operating income, the corporate advisory and restructuring group operated at a loss of approximately $1 million this year, compared with operating income of $5 million in last year's first quarter and a loss of approximately $3 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Quickly on corporate expenses. In the first quarter they ran at $61 million this includes approximately $9 million for rationalization of London real estate and $7 million in severance. Additionally, there were $8 million in items primarily associated with the change in CEOs that will not impact the company in subsequent periods. So on a normalized basis corporate expenses ran at about $37 million in the first quarter. Excluding the impairment charge which had no tax benefit MMC's consolidated effective tax rate was 30.6% in the first quarter of 2008. Primarily due to the geographic mix of our earnings. The effective tax rate on ongoing operations is projected to be in the range of 30% to 32% for the reminder of the year. As indicated in the press release, we received an additional 10.8 million shares of common stock in the first quarter, completing out $800 million accelerated share repurchase program, funded back in August of 2007. In total, we repurchased 32.1 million shares from this program, at an average price of $24.94, including our earlier $500 million ASR program; we have repurchased 48 million shares of common stock since last May. On the cash front, cash and debt, we ended the first quarter with $1.3 billion in cash, as you know our cash utilization is typically greatest in the first quarter primarily due to the funding of bonus payments. Additionally, we used cash to fund $250 million of debt that matured in February, our cash generation typically accelerates in the second half of the year, we expect that again this year and we do not have any additional debt maturing until June 2009 and one other coal on our cash that remains this year is our final New York Attorney General Settlement payment of a $170 million that will be made in June. Net debt which best represents our capital position was $2.3 billion at the end of Q1, a significant decrease from $3.5 billion in the corresponding period last year. The capital management activities we have completed over the last 3 years represent a significant deleveraging of MMC's balance sheet which leaves us at a current debt position that is a very comfortable and gives us excellent financial flexibility. With that let me turn over to Michelle for update an update on Mercer.
M. Michele Burns - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mercer: Thanks Matt. I am grateful for this opportunity to talk about Mercer today. I would like to use the time to cover our overall operating results, provide some insight into the businesses within the portfolio and share our positive view on the future. Since the last time I spoke to this Group, we've continued to make great strides at Mercer. Coming on the heels of a successful 2007, Q1 was another good quarter, in fact it marked the 10th straight quarter of year-over-year growth in revenue and the 6th straight quarter of bottom line growth, cash flow continued to be strong as well. Revenue grew 16% compared to prior with each of our businesses posting significant gains and all regions growing. Its particularly gratifying to see strong growth across the board which speaks directly to the health of our portfolio as individual businesses and in the aggregate. One question you are likely to raise is our sensitivity to overall economic and equity market conditions. Our results show that we can grow despite these challenges. This is due in part to the diversity of our revenue strength which include a blend of recurring consulting engagements and commissions. Project based fee arrangements, stable participant driven outsourcing arrangements and the increasing importance of revenue streams tied to assets under management. An example of the stabilizing effect of this diversity is that while equity market declines have a negative impact on our investment management and outsourcing revenue, market declines often create increased demand for investment consulting business. In fact, our clients evidenced an increase need for many of our services in challenging time. This is not to say that a prolonged or severe down turn won't impact us, but we see continued strength in our pipeline across our businesses and regions. As you would expect, we are carefully monitoring our revenue strengths and operating metrics to ensure we keep our cost base in line. But we remain cautiously optimistic that we can continue to post solid growth. As I've talked about before, one of Mercer's significant advantages is the portfolio of offerings, they gives us diversity. Diversity in the solutions we bring to market, diversity in business models and geographic diversity. That is why I would like to draw your attention to the change we've made and how we are reporting our revenue. Starting this quarter we will report along the same divisions we used to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace consulting, outsourcing and investments. This change will allow us to speak to the investment community, the same way we speak to our client, and we'll create clear distinction between the three pillars of our portfolio. It will also serve to highlight, the growing importance to both our strategy and our results of having outsourcing and investment capability, which we feel are integral to serving our clients and our shareholders needs. And the exciting growth you hear about when I discuss each of these pillars would bear out how well our unique portfolio is resonating in the marketplace. I'll start the review with our Consulting lines, which includes our traditional areas of retirement and health and benefit as well as a suite of businesses and business models, dedicated to areas outside our benefits core. Combined, these Consulting businesses account for 71% of our revenue and grew 14%. As the world's largest actuarial business, our retirement business continues to grow with $313 million of revenue in the quarter, or 34% of our total. We had a particularly strong quarter in the Americas. This is due in part to continued impact of the pension protection act, but like our other regions, we are also benefiting from the increasing diversity of our retirement offering, which address an evolving marketplace. Many of these new offerings are geared towards helping clients manage the shifts within the defined benefits landscape, or the increasing importance of defined contribution scheme. These are often delivered in tandem with our investments, or outsourcing capabilities, or both. This bundling is another indicator of the power of our portfolio. In addition in Europe, we showed our commitment to this business this quarter by acquiring Hoefer a leading German retirement firm. This acquisition builds on our strength in the important German market, and will allow us to bring our full range of services to Hoefer within Germany and around the world. Our health and benefits business posted revenues of $220 million in the quarter, 24% of our total. We all know that health care costs are and will remain a major business issue. This is true in both mature economies as well as in developing ones, as such we continue to grow around the world. Our largest market, the U.S. continues to show very good new business production and retention with an emphasis on sales beginning to pay off. Our other consulting lines represent a board mix of businesses and revenue models that go beyond our benefit pedigree, examples include our survey and data business, our human capital capabilities and our unparalleled ability to help clients navigate the broad employee related issues in the M&A arena. As a Group these business generated $126 million of revenue in the quarter, 13% of our total. As we continue to develop data, capabilities and expertise to meet our clients needs for solutions to their most complicated and strategic employee issue. We expect strong continued growth; following consulting outsourcing is the next biggest pillar in our portfolio with $188 million in revenue which represents 20% of our total. Growth for the quarter was 17% with largest contribution coming from the U.S. This excellent performance is directly linked to our success in the total benefits outsourcing or TBO market where we continue to land in the marketplace by combining and simplifying administration across the defined benefit, defined contribution and help in benefits areas. This growth translates to improving economics as we increase our operating efficiency and add scale. The investment pillar consist of our investment consulting and investment management businesses and accounted for 9% of our revenue. Year-over-year growth was 31% driven by increase to demand in investment consulting and growth in assets. Our assets under management grew from $14.7 billion on March 31, 2007 to $19.8 billion on March 31, 2008. Investment consulting achieved growth in excess of 20% in both the Americas and Europe continuing a longer trend of outstanding results. The main driver of the asset growth was the traction we have achieved in the U.S. market and increasingly in Europe, with the value proposition of compressive investment management services utilizing implemented consulting and multi-manager strategies. Together these two businesses allow us to bring a continuum of advice and solutions to meet our clients' needs within the retirement arena and beyond. Going forward we remain optimistic about the future for Mercer and see opportunities for success in both how we compete in the marketplace as well as within our own four walls. First as you've heard we believe our diverse ship complementary portfolio will continue to allow us to lead in the marketplace. We will continue to build our intellectual capital and bring these solutions to market organically because we believe there is continued opportunity for market share gains for players who can deliver best of breed global solution, where it makes sense for shareholders and clients we will also pursue external capabilities that further expand our solution set and global reach. We also see opportunity to invest in how we operate as a business. We are building more of a sales culture, by dedicated resources as well as firm wide tools and processes, we will extend our capability to deliver world-class operating metric so we can better understand our economics at a project and client level and we will continue to look for opportunities to seek operational efficiency with the retirement service centers and our broad new captive offshore capabilities based in India, serving as an example of our commitment. Because of these opportunities we believe that we can continue to grow and take market share over the next few years while improving our margins at the same time. The past year and a half has shown that Mercer is a gem within the MMC portfolio and we intend to continue to building on that success. Thanks for the time to speak with you today, I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Michele, okay I think its time now for questions so we would like to hear from you. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Good morning and thank you. I was just wondering if you can talk about, a little bit about the seasonality in your business. Last year the first quarter margin was 20ish on an adjusted basis and second through fourth quarters fell of very significantly, and I know there was a lot of messy stuff in those numbers but given everything that's happened in the last couple of years, it's hard to really track what the true underlying seasonality in the business is and I was just wondering if you could chat about that a little bit. And then secondly can you just go through how foreign exchange impacted earnings and if possible margins in the various segments?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Larry listen we will do foreign exchange afterwards, do seasonality first and I assume you are really talking there about Marsh and Carpenter.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Yeah, exactly.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, well Dan you are here.
Daniel S. Glaser - Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: Hi Larry, The way seasonality works at marsh our largest international region is Europe and a great deal of your Europe's renewal particularly in countries like France are in the first quarter and so we tend to see the revenue come in from those locations, early first quarter and the expenses live with us for the rest of the year and that's why you see a bit of a fall of as we go through the year.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: And well Peter's here from Carpenter, Peter yours is even more seasonal so
Peter Zaffino - Chief Executive Officer of Guy Carpenter: Right and the treaty business typically tries to match with fiscal years of our clients insurance companies and the predominant amount more than 60% comes up for January 1 and will flow through the year.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, so, in Carpenter's case, if you missed the first the of the year you got a difficult year ahead of you so, that's what we faced although we looked like we are moving into a better year starting next year, okay Larry so now lets do foreign exchange.
Matthew B. Bartley - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Shall I take that one, Larry let me make a general observation first because we have obviously a fair amount of data with the diversification of the businesses and geographies we generally see that while there is some quarter-to-quarter variability, the impact of foreign exchange on our results and I mean just digression, obviously when you look at the revenue you see the impact pretty clearly in the of this year and you can assume that, that is matched, relatively, fairly with what is happening on the expense side. While we see the variability quarter-to-quarter the diversification of these businesses has historically resulted in not significant net impact either way from ForEx perspective on annual results, some up, some down and so we feel we got to bear that. Now obviously in a quarter like the last one... like this one, the first quarter, were the Euro strengthened is significantly again the dollar although interestingly the pound did not, we got a little bit of assistance in the quarter. But we expect to re-trade that, for that to fall out and dissipate over the balance of the year. So I would say the best way to look at these business is to accept the fact or recognize, that we are likely not to have substantial ForEx impact on a net basis hit us, pretty much washes out, that's been historically the case.
Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Okay
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Next question?
Operator: Thank you and our next question will come from Meyer Shields.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.: Dated perspective, but Brian if you would look back to the 845 million of contingents or MSAs that were given up, immediately post spitzer. Do you have a sense now as to how much of that you've recovered and how much is still left?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: How much is recovered you mean in terms of getting revenue in a different way?
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.: Yeah.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: That's an interesting question. I am not sure I have the answer to that frankly, its pretty complicated because that was just one... that earning stream that disappears, and so how do make up that kind of earnings stream you have to get it through normal commission in fee income. You trace it back to 04, there was a significant drop of, our margins have suffered as a result of from that period, forward so its slowly building up but we clearly haven't made it back... we clearly have not made it back so that's one of our issues. If you look at this, Marsh in particular one of our biggest issues off course is our revenue and we have a... we have got to find ways to getting a better revenue, movement within the company... I know Dan you want to add any to that?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: I think its sort of highlight's the un-level playing fields that we have in the insurance market place which is inherently unfair, you got one situation where certain players are helped to a standard in which there is full disclosure and no contingencies, where the rest of the market participants operate in a world of no disclosure and full contingencies, I would think that overtime that has to work itself out.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.: Okay. Right and in terms of follow-up I think Brian you mentioned at Marsh head count was down 150 in the quarter, obviously go back a couple of years there's lot of involuntary departures from management perspective. Can you break down that 150 between how many people you want... you terminated and how many people left that you want to keep.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, okay what we are talking about terminations and Dan I think wants to take that if you don't mind that.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.: No.
Daniel S. Glaser - Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: Sure, I mean one on an overall basis the 150 departure in the first quarter were all managed by us and so those, those were an actual reduction in force. When I look at turnover overall, actually we are at historic levels now so I don't view employee departures as an issue for Marsh and in fact I can't hire all the people who want to join, so on an overall stand point we have got the right base of colleagues to handle the business we have until winning the marketplace of play. Okay, let's go to another question, thank you.
Operator: Thank you and our next question will come from David Small with Bear Stearns.
David Small - Bear Stearns: Yeah hi, just two quick questions. Can you just clarify a little bit the guy... on the Guy Carpenter margin compression, you have kind of eluded to it in your commentary but maybe you could give us a little more meat their.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, sure. I'll start and let Peter, Peter answer, the compression is really rate, we're talking about the declining rate level across the board and I would say internationally in particular so it's really a direct result of what we do as we take our commissions from our clients, but Peter you want to add in that?
Peter Zaffino - Chief Executive Officer of Guy Carpenter: We have a large property catastrophe book that is over-weighted in the U.S.. Rates are coming off stronger in United States and therefore its effected our overall result in the first quarter probably a little bit more then if there was an even weighted average rate reduction across the globe and we have had a little bit of a short fall in new business in the first quarter and that is really been the impact with the compression of margin.
David Small - Bear Stearns: Can you just give us a magnitude of how much margin compressed and then just on the FX question from earlier, I just wasn't clear did FX impact the margin in the risks and insurance business? Thanks.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, let's do the FX questions okay, go ahead Matt.
Matthew B. Bartley - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: While there is variability quarter-to-quarter, and David I want to reemphasize the broader picture, so we will see some variability quarter-to-quarter and given the pretty significant move in the euro in this quarter, we got a little bit of assistance across our businesses in this quarter not from all currencies but in the euro jurisdiction, yes we got a little bit of help and we expect that to dissipate over the course of the year. And looking back over the last couple of years, what's giving us that sense is as I look back historically, I see that net-net again across businesses we pretty much wash out on the effects line.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, so David... we don't close the margin but I do want to emphasize that because of the situation with this year we had to do something about the expense level and that's we want to restore our margins and that's the way we will restore them. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you our next question will come from Bill Wilts with Morgan Stanley.
Bill Wilts - Morgan Stanley: Thanks, good morning.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Bill Wilts - Morgan Stanley: Good morning, question for Brian could you talk about the meetings you've had with clients, I guess I am thinking specifically of risk managers. What concerns have they raised? What have you... what's been the nature of the discussions, just some color and then related to that have you lost any significant clients since joining and what's been your analysis of any of those situations.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well I'm just really glad you asked this client question, you know, because I had... I went to RIMS. Just got back, I assume everybody knows what it is, but just for clarification, it's where the risk mangers get together. There are our clients and they come from all over the world and I met them every half hour. Morning, noon and night. So it was really a lot fun and I never thought I would say I had a lot of fun at RIMS, but I actually had lot of fun at RIMS and Marsha I thought did an extraordinary job so my hats off to you guys listening, did an extraordinary job, but back to the clients. So yeah I sat down with them and you know, was an interesting theme, consistent theme, one, great loyalty, amazing loyalty. Through thick and thin, some of them had specific problems, you know I can't tell you... I can't think of one that was complaining about service, in fact it was other way around I mean they loved their service. They are little concerned about what we are going to do to the organization... they don't want to lose the level of service that we provide them and you know I think Dan will repeat this but almost to... almost everyone of them said look whatever you do, don't touch my team, the group that's taking care of me leave them alone they are great and said that's terrific and that's what I see, and I think we have got great people, so that's not our problem, and clearly our clients are not our problems, loyalty and service, what's our problem, we don't make enough money and that's where... I told them that's where you come in, we need to get more money from you guys, and they say it with the right... I think with the right attitude and I think its... so if I had to worry about things that we could fix around here I could have worse problems then that, we have great people, great service, great loyal clients, we just got to work a little bit on that, on that matching of expense, I am sure there's things that we do that they don't need, we have got to fix that and the level of service we'll have to work on to get it at the right level, then we need to work on our revenues but the clients concern is please keep up the quality of service you are providing me. That in the... and the other thing is that they are very happy, I think it was the happiest group I have run into. Dan, you want to add anything to that?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: Sure, just in terms of a professional services business you link high and you lose some clients and that's a steady state of the business. We have not lost any clients recently of any materiality and in fact our new business resulted, last year we had very strong new business almost $900 million of new business throughout the year we have set ourselves a hearty target for this year and we are on track with similar or even above that level of performance, so our new business results prove that we are in the market place and we are gaining a lot more clients and then we are losing by a long stretch.
Bill Wilts - Morgan Stanley: Thanks
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Bill Wilts - Morgan Stanley: You feel like, you have the right internal data to make the decision on client profitability or is that a focus for you?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: I mean, client profitability is an important measure but its almost like you need to be optimized to really run your business on a client profitability basis so I'm running the business based upon geographic profitability office-by-office and we used our end time system to evaluate within the round where we are on an individual account basis but I'm not using that as the way to drive the business I am actually using it as a pricing of services component and we're driving the business based of our geography.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, we should go to another question, thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Brian Meredith of UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Yeah, good morning. Two quick questions, first, Matt, the variable compensation, $30 million is it going to be similar in the second quarter as well that the kind of adverse year-over-year comparison?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: No, the answer is no, because the adjustment as it plays through, there will be a little bit of that lingering because as we indicated on the call the adjustment for accounting purposed happened in the third quarter... third quarter Brian, we should be tracking relatively... there should be little to any real discrepancy, there will be a little bit in the second quarter but and actually we do... we will have a carryover of some recovery that we need to make in the second-quarter, so second quarter will have a little bit of the discrepancy that we will have to cover. Third quarter not.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Okay great.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: nd the balance obviously in the fourth quarter like the third.
Brian Meredith - UBS: And then the second question is, Brian and Dan, I think I heard that you said that at Marsh right now with respect to people and headcount, you are kind of right sized so the question I have going forward is where are the margin improvements going to come from Marsh Inc., you obviously had a nice 250 basis point expansion, I am sure that margins aren't at an acceptable level, yet for your purposes, where you think they should be. Were else are they going to come form?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, that's a good question. I am not sure that Dan said that he was comfortable with the level of head count and both of us I think are saying the same thing which is there's more work to be done. Our margins are not nearer were they need to be, not even close and that's hard slogging and Dan's in the middle of that with his team. So now we don't feel comfortable yet with our levels.
Operator: Thank you and our next question will come form Keith Walsh with Citi.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup: Good morning everyone and thanks for the new disclosure, very helpful. First question for Peter. You know when I think about Guy Carpenter's revenue decline, and its very different than your competitors Aon and Willis. They are also experiencing tough pricing environment. What specifically you talked about new business, but what about retention, if you could talk about that year-over-year and then I have a follow up.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: As I said before we feel like we have waited a little bit more when you compare our competitors to the U.S. and that's where we are down, because of pricing coming off in the U.S., our new business short fall has had an impact and for January 1st we did loose couple of clients, there were isolated instances but nonetheless, certainly had an impact on our first quarter results, and facultative which is an area were we had some turnover in 2007 had an impact on the first quarter, but believe we have the right strategy going forward on that.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup: Okay, and then for Brian in past comments you have said you are a builder and you may make transactions. Can you effectively integrate acquisitions when Marsh still needs a great deal of management attention then why not use the excess cash you have right now to buyback stock especially if the earnings power is not showing through right now? Thanks.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well Frank that's good question, I mean you have to get the company in the right position to accept a new company into it. It's no question about it I wouldn't contemplate making a major acquisition within Marsh at this point until then it feels comfortable with having the operation running at the right level. However, that doesn't mean that you can't bolt things on, its a big world out there is geography we want to continue to expand in. The operations internationally are actually pretty good and those integrations wouldn't affect by any measure but would be happening in other parts of Marsh. So we don't want to miss the opportunity to continuing to spill at our capabilities where the world's insurance market is growing that would be crazy. And there are other parts of MMC. So if we would say Marsh is not quite ready for an acquisition it doesn't mean that there aren't other parts of MMC that aren't ready for an acquisition. So, the use of our funds is something we work very heavily and what is the best use of that for shareholder value creation. And I prefer to build out the businesses and put money where we believe great success can be achieved, that would be my first priority clearly if there are no things that we can do then we use the capital management tools available to us primarily share buyback. Okay. Let's... why don't we take another question?
Operator: Thank you. We'll now hear from Jay Cohen with Merrill Lynch.
Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch: Yes, two questions, why were the consulting margins down from the year earlier quarter? And then secondly I guess back to the insurance services the margins at this unit are still significantly lower and than the major competitors, and I am wondering Brian and Dan I guess if you enable to pin point, the problem is we don't have a lot of disclosure from anyone. What the real expanse is are broken down and so its difficult to say, why are MMC's margins, insurance margins that much lower than the other. I'm wonder if you guys having a looked at it very carefully come up with two or three key factors in drive in that difference and in the consulting margin difference.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, let's, margin question first on consulting, so we really have to break that down between Michele and John between Mercer and Oliver Wyman. So Michele you want to start and then maybe John can pickup?
M. Michele Burns - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mercer: Sure, I will just give general comment, generally in this segment the revenue flowed in the segment were quickly expenses could be taken out. In addition how I had highlighted in Mercer portfolio we had revenue decreases due to global market declines in the asset... under administration and asset under management, those kinds of revenue decreases dropped to margin directly dollar for dollar in the short run. John you want to take it up?
John Drzik - President and Chief Executive Officer of Oliver Wyman Group: Sure in Oliver Wyman the principle reason was the first one Michele mentioned which is that the revenue growth decelerated in the quarter relative to where we expect it to be. And so the expense didn't decelerate as fast. But we're taking measures now to align the expenses for our revenue projection for the rest of the year.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. So let's move to the insurance side, which will be principally Marsh. So you want to do that Dan?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: Sure, I mean, from the first I think, on the revenue side apart from some mild mix of business issues between whether employee benefits is in one of the competitors versus not and those kind of issues, or whether someone has more of a commission base because they are in smaller markets and larger markets. So there'll be some mild mix of business issues. But really on the revenue side, there's no real difference in the marketplace between how we are compensated. So it really points to expenses. Now I think there's few different things that Mike and I are driving toward, one we think that the centralized cost Marsh are significantly higher than what they should be, and we are very focused on that and I am quite comfortable that as we move through the year we will find ways of dramatically impacting the centralized cost without influencing or impacting client service at all. And so we are focused on that. I also think that when I look at our salary and benefit as a percentage of revenue and our technology spend as a percentage of revenue, I think those are about too high from where they need to be and so I would think that those are the primary factors and what we are focused on.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Another question please.
Operator: Thank you, we'll hear from Alain Karaoglan.
Alain Karaoglan - Banc Of America Securities: Two questions and essentially they're follow-ups on Jay's questions. Brian do you have a timing in terms of your vision or where you think the order be able to achieve margins that you would be happy with. And related to the comment by Dan, is it the question of cost cutting or do you have to take market share on the revenue side in order to get to where do you want get and do you think you can do that? And then I didn't understand the answer on the consulting margin fro Mercer. The revenues were up significantly but the operating income was up a lot less than that.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay we'll leave the Mercer question for last and Michael can do that. The timing on them margin improvement well you know... you and I both want this thing fixed as quickly as possible, and that is what we're trying to do. Time is not on our side we know that but I just don't want to give specific time frame and so we are not but I will tell you that it weights on us and we are working as quickly as possible trying to outline that we are... we been taking actions in this place and so it is not like we are sitting around. But so you know bare with us we are moving on this thing and we will get these margins in the right order as quickly as we can doing it the right way so we don't disrupt this company. Cost cutting etcetera versus getting market share Dan you want to?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: I mean its really simple we have to improve our margins significantly you can grow revenue or you could... and you can cut expense and you can do that in different measures. I mean I definitely think there is a revenue story here and that we're beginning to grow again. Its tough in the market environment that we are in. we're in our commission businesses way to coming off significantly. But we can't really limit that, because that's good for our clients. And so I don't want to have our brokers of any sense of doing anything but getting the absolute best deal in terms of conditions they can and as they do for our clients. So, it is what it is. But I do think that there are many things in we can do on the revenue side. For example, with Brian in my insurance company background we look at it segmentation in a much different way than the typical brokerage firm. We are going through the firm right now looking at various segmentations strategy and I think there is revenue debt combine our existing business more than what it currently is. So it's not just increase in market share. I also think that as I mentioned before there is level plain field which I think over time will level its self out in one way or the other. Our end commission strategy is in early stages but its developing and it will lead to improve the revenue performances some point in time. We are looking at placement houses in the United States which will help us on t cost side, but it would also help us on the revenue side as well because the there will be pretty significant efficiency gain for certain insurance companies and we should be able to develop some sort of arrangements with them to share and some of the efficiency gain that they will see. So I do think that there is a revenue story to be had with which will marry with the hard look at expenses that will take throughout this year.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. And then last Michele.
M. Michele Burns - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mercer: And in terms of margin, the margins your looking at are you referenced operating income for the segment. So in both of our businesses revenue still grow disproportionately grew this time in Mercer. The margin represent both of your us and I think we answered the question as to the revenue drop as opposed to the ability to take expense without in commensurate here to.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Lets do one more question.
Operator: Thank you and our final question will come from Thomas Mitchell.
Thomas Mitchell - Miller Tabak & Company: If you look at... in the insurance brokerage business if you look at the broad picture of a continuing not vicious but sort of a gentle but relentless rate decline for the property in casualty companies and then lined that up with the values of things that your clients are ensuring in what's happening as a trend with those. What do you thin the outlook over in another next two or three months, but may be the next two or three years would be for the size of the pie, the total market for your insurance brokering services, growing stable at risk of going down, how do you see that picture?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chief Executive Officer of Marsh: There's a couple of things here, one I think you have to look at the rating environment for insurance company only impact our commission business. So, big chunk of our business, about a 50% chunk of our business is on a fee business and is not impact by the rating environment. And the rating environment is pretty clear. The insurance businesses is a supply and demand business and when in insurance company, make a lot of money, then they tend to attract additional capital and rates being to come down and once rates start coming down, they tend to keep going down until certain insurance company actually loose money and with raw capital. And so, we are in that part of the cycle, it's a cycle were repeat itself and I have been in this business 26 years, I have been through it several times, and what I can tell you is the factor will come down, the factor will go up. I wouldn't describe it as necessarily gentle, it's been quite aggressive in part and that's good news for our client that it actually probably good news in terms of the fast of the... the quicker of the asset. So ion terms of timing of that, it all depends on losses, if you tell me what the losses are going to be I will tell you when it happened.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: The only other thing I would like to add to that Dan is just in terms of market share issues, it's a big world out there and if you look at our growth rates, our international growth rates in Marsh continue to be good on a organic basis, stronger outside he U.S. than in the U.S., and therefore we don't want to overlook the fact that this is a changing world, the global economy is a lie than well and we are in the middle of it. Any ways, thank you, I just could of wrap up here if I could operate or just say, just give a closing comment, we know we took initial steps as quarter to build the foundation for stand able growth, it's a start, its only that I didn't take the job to be a caretaker or oversee incremental improvements and results, we don't have any modest ambitions over, we say the simply objective is to build the premier professional service to determine risk strategy in human capital and generate a compelling return for all our stake orders. There's a lot of work we got to do, but the journey has begun and I look forward to reporting back to you in three months. So thank you everybody.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We appreciate your attendance and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to MMC's Conference Call. Fourth quarter year-end 2007 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on MMC's website at www.mmc.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. In particular, references during this conference call to anticipated or expected results of operations for 2008 or subsequent periods are forward-looking statements, and MMC's actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. Please refer to MMC's most recent SEC filings as well as the Company's earnings release, which are available on the MMC website for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn this over to Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning and thank you for joining us on today's call. I am Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of MMC. Earlier today, we reported financial results for the fourth quarter of 2007. As many of you know, I was named CEO less than two weeks ago. So the report and discussion of these results is part of my process of learning about the state of the company as well as serving to inform you. On today's call I'll make some brief remarks about the opportunity I see here at MMC before turning it over to two of my new colleagues. First, our CFO, Matt Bartley, will present the results for the quarter and the full year. Second, we'll hear from Dan Glaser, the new CEO of Marsh Inc. Dan joined us on December 10th, so compared to me he is a veteran. Dan will talk about his initial assessment of Marsh and the plan he is developing for the turnaround of the Marsh business. In addition to Matt and Dan, also on the call are Michele Burns, CEO of Mercer, and John Drzik, CEO of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff, Head of Investor Relations for MMC. I'd like to start off with a few personal comments. One question many people have asked me is, Brian, why did you take this job? MMC is a company that's faced and continues to face a lot of challenges. Well, frankly, that's exactly the reason I took the job. As soon as I was contacted about this opportunity, I knew I was interested in it. It wasn't because I had retired from ACE and was open to taking on new challenges. I was excited about it because I know this company, I know what it has been and I know what it can be again. MMC and I have been around each other for decades in various ways. I worked with Marsh and Guy Carpenter, and I've been a client of Mercer. I have admired what this company has done. MMC is a company that has brought together a unique set of assets and performs very important and worthwhile functions for enterprises and people around the world. But MMC is also a company that's been hit with a lot challenges and gone through some very tough times. Mistakes were made. And while many individual businesses and many people and teams have done outstanding jobs, as a whole, as a corporation, we failed to perform for our shareholders as we needed to. Despite this reality, the company is still strong. It has outstanding people, great intellectual capital, tremendous services, unparalleled relationships, and despite everything, a great spirit and sense of commitment. And that's what made this such a compelling opportunity for me. I know we can do better. Frankly, one of the first steps in doing better was the hiring of Dan Glaser to be the CEO of Marsh. I highly knew Dan by reputation. He is highly regarded by industry leaders whom I respect. Dan and I met before I accepted the job. I liked him immediately, and more importantly, I liked what he is doing and will do. It made my decision very easy. In the final analysis, it was my admiration for this company and my recognition of its tremendous unrealized potential that attracted me. I hope that what I've just said helps you understand why I am here, but I also understand that ultimately it's performance, not potential that counts. So, let's start today by looking directly and critically at our performance, and for that I will turn it over to Matt.
Matthew B. Bartley - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Brian. Good morning, everyone. I will begin by summarizing our fourth quarter 2007 earnings as reported and with reference to noteworthy and specific items followed by a brief discussion of the results of each of our operating segments and companies, and concluding with an overview of our capital management activities and our increasing capital flexibility. Let's begin with earnings. Reported earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.17 for the quarter. Significantly, some discrete items affected our results. First, noteworthy items, which are highlighted on page 11 of the press release, primarily restructuring charges from ongoing cost reduction initiatives totaled $59 million or about $0.07 of EPS in the fourth quarter. In the prior year period, noteworthy items netted to a $5 million credit, almost a penny of EPS. Second, in addition to noteworthy items, there were $14 million of incremental costs associated with the departure of MMC's former CEO reducing EPS in the fourth quarter by an incremental $0.02. As adjusted for these discrete items, we look at our results from operations for the fourth quarter of 2007 to be $0.26. This compares with $0.39 in the fourth quarter of 2006 on a similarly adjusted basis. To be clear, these numbers should be viewed as non-GAAP. Now let me briefly summarize the consolidated revenue story before turning to the individual operating segments and businesses. In the fourth quarter, MMC's overall revenue rose 8% to $2.9 billion, driven by strong growth in our consulting operations. This segment, which made up approximately 45% of consolidated revenue, grew 19% on a reported basis and 13% on an underlying basis in the quarter. Underlying basis measures the change in revenue before the impact of acquisitions and dispositions using consistent currency exchange rates. For the full year, the increase in revenue was also 8% from $10.5 billion to $11.4 billion, again, this growth was fueled by strong growth across consulting operations, which grew 16% on a reported basis and 10% on an underlying basis. Now let me briefly discuss our reporting segments and operations. Risk and Insurance Services revenue of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007 was essentially unchanged from the same period of 2006, reflecting significantly soft market conditions in both the primary and reinsurance markets, as well as the fall-off in revenue from the investment portfolio that we report as Risk Capital Holdings, or RCH, on the revenue analysis schedules, pages 8 and 9 of the press release. Let's take a closer look at the component parts of Risk and Insurance Services. Beginning with primary insurance broking, Marsh's fourth quarter revenue increased 6% to $1.2 billion compared with the fourth quarter of 2006. On an underlying basis, growth was 1% positive. Marsh generated very strong new business in the quarter. Growth in new business excluding foreign exchange fluctuations was 8%, driven by strong performance in the United States. This solid performance in new business generation was on top of very strong new business production in the fourth quarter of 2006. And to give you some perspective on the amount of new business generated in the most recent quarter, it was similar to the level of Marsh's best new business production in any quarter since Q1 of 2003, an especially impressive performance considering that 2003 was very much a hard insurance market. Note that insurance market conditions continued to soften as 2007 progressed. Property and casualty commercial insurance premium rates were down approximately 10% at the beginning of 2007 and continued to worsen to soften during the course of the year. Marsh was able to overcome these market conditions and improve client revenue retention by one full percentage point from the third quarter of 2007. For the full year, our client revenue retention rate declined one percentage point compared with 2006. Now, let me make one note here. When we talk about client revenue retention, we are not talking about the number of clients retained. We are talking about the amount of all prior year client revenue, the pool of all prior client year revenue that we retain or replace in the following year. And that is a metric that we look at very closely to see the strength of the business. Dan will offer a few more comments on Marsh in the following segment. Turning now to our reinsurance operations of Guy Carpenter, fourth quarter revenue declined 2%, again, market conditions significantly affecting this, from $171 million to $167 million. The fourth quarter is historically Carpenter's lightest with the most significant annual client renewal periods in January and July. This revenue decline was overwhelmingly due to weakness in the facultative business, which accounts for less than 10% of Carpenter's revenue. Market conditions and some senior U.K. facultative departures that occurred earlier in the year led to the revenue shortfall. At the same time, Carpenter's U.S. Treaty business was particularly strong, seeing revenue growth of over 5% in Q4 on an underlying basis. This despite the fact that in the fourth quarter reinsurance rates continued to soften across most P&C lines globally. Since pricing peaked for most U.S. coastal property catastrophe coverages back at the 2006 mid-year renewals, we have seen the trend in price declines continue through the January 2008 renewals across virtually all lines of businesses. Two years of benign wind storms in the U.S. combined with strong underwriting results by insurers and reinsures have led to higher risk retention by Carpenter's clients and continued pressure on reinsurance premium pricing. Nonetheless, for the full year 2007, Carpenter produced positive underlying revenue growth of 1%. In full year 2007, U.S. Treaty business showed strong underlying growth of 5%, equal to the Q4 growth rate. The market continues to be difficult. January renewals reflected global price declines in property catastrophe rates of 7% to 12%, while decreases across casualty lines were seen on the order of 5% to 10%. Turning to Risk Capital Holdings, RCH had substantially lower revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007, as I suggested would be the case during last quarter's call. Revenue at RCH went from $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 to $8 million in the most recent period. This $66 million decline negatively affected EPS by about $0.08. RCH's revenue this quarter derived primarily from mark-to-market adjustments. For the full year, revenue decreased 16% to $163 million in 2007 from $193 million in '06. Looking forward, we expect that revenue from RCH will continue to be volatile on a quarter-to-quarter basis and will be significantly lower in aggregate than the revenue shown in 2007. A quick note on operating income for this segment, looking at Risk and Insurance Services in total, operating income, excluding noteworthy items, was $100 million in the quarter compared with $180 million last year, primarily a consequence of the revenue decrease at RCH. Marsh's NOI showed significant improvement from the third quarter of 2007, as well as an increase from the fourth quarter of 2006, with increases in margins both sequentially and year-over-year. As I previously mentioned, the fourth quarter is Carpenter's lightest of the year and generally produces roughly breakeven results. Difficult market conditions and shortfalls in facultative business in Q4 '07 caused results that were somewhat worse than this. Now let's turn to Consulting. Revenue for this segment approached $5 billion in 2007. Both Mercer and Oliver Wyman had very strong fourth quarter performances, which resulted in growth for the overall Consulting segment of 19% in revenue and 38% in operating income. While some moderation in these stellar growth rates will occur, we still expect meaningful growth from our consulting businesses going forward. On a GAAP basis, note that the operating margin improved 170 basis points from 10.5% in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 12.2% in the most recent quarter. For the full year 2007, the GAAP margin improvement was 140 basis points. Excluding noteworthy items, the margin improvement was about 1 percentage point for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Now, on Mercer's specifically, fourth quarter revenue performance was strong, 14% growth on a reported basis and 8% underlying. This impressive performance was achieved throughout the organization with reported revenue increasing significantly in the fourth quarter for each of Mercer's four major practice areas. Retirement and investment revenue rose 16% driven by increased demand for retirement valuation services in Continental Europe and strong results for investment consulting. Health and Benefits revenue increased 10%, largely resulting from strong new business and a higher retention rates on existing business. Outsourcing revenue increased 17%, reflecting increased and increasing activities... activity in Mercer's total benefits outsourcing offering. And the Talent segment showed revenue increasing 14% in the quarter, driven in large measure by increased survey sales. Data on work phase data... data and information on workforce databases and global mobility are good examples. Oliver Wyman, the strong demand for the range of Oliver Wyman Consulting Services continued in the fourth quarter resulting in annual revenue exceeding $1.5 billion. Reported revenue growth was 28% in Q4 with double-digit increases achieved by both its management and economic consulting operations. Financial services consulting was particularly strong in the quarter. Revenue growth was enhanced by performance fees related to certain engagements where a portion of Oliver Wyman's compensation was tied to benefits immediately received and realized by the clients. [Technical Difficulty]. Hold on a second while we sort out what is impeding your ability to hear my remarks. Revenue growth at Oliver Wyman was enhanced... let's try once more. Let me start again with Oliver Wyman. Strong demand for the range of Oliver Wyman Consulting Services in the quarter, aggregate revenue for the year $1.5 billion. Reported revenue growth was 28% in Q4, double-digit increases in both management and economic consulting services, and financial services particularly strong. Revenue growth significantly was enhanced by performance fees related to certain engagements where a potion of Oliver Wyman's compensation was tied to the benefits immediately realized by clients. These performance fees, which are generally received at the end of consulting assignments, contributed about 8 percentage points to underlying revenue growth, which was a strong 22% in the fourth quarter. Now, turning to Kroll. In the fourth quarter, Kroll's reported revenue was up 3% to $249 million. On an underlying basis, revenue declined 3%. Revenue from Kroll's technology businesses rose 18% to $149 million, partially due to a recent acquisition at Ontrack, the data recovery and legal technology business. Also within technology, background screening performed very well, driven by its identity theft prevision and recovery services. One unit of the technology practice area that was particularly challenged was Kroll's mortgage screening operation, Factual Data, which experienced a decline in volume reflecting current credit market conditions. Over in the consulting area of Kroll's operations, revenue decreased 13% to $100 million. The corporate restructuring practice continues to operate in a very challenging environment. Kroll's security practice saw a revenue decline as it works through the backlog associated with federal government contracts. There was, however, strong growth in the business intelligence and investigations operation, which saw revenue increase by 30% over the fourth quarter of 2006. This improvement was driven by notable growth in European and Asian markets, accompanied by strong growth in profitability. Kroll's operating income in the fourth quarter of 2007 was a disappointing $17 million, down from $45 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006. The reduced levels of profitability reflect volume reductions experienced in the restructuring, mortgage screening, and security businesses, together with an unfavorable year-over-year comparison resulting from a gain on the early termination of a licensing agreement that Kroll recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006. Just a quick word on corporate expenses. Excluding noteworthy items and the incremental expense associated with the departure of MMC's former CEO, corporate expenses in Q4 were $41 million, in line with our recent run rate levels. We are taking immediate actions to reduce corporate expenses. We have terminated spending on various initiatives and have either eliminated certain shared services or move them into the operating companies where they can be managed more effectively. We expect that these actions will start to improve profitability in the second quarter of 2008 and it will have an increasing impact on profitability as the year progresses. Finally, a little bit on capital management and our flexibility. In August 2007, we initiated an $800 million accelerated share repurchase program that delivered 21 million shares that month. Based on the final average share price during the buying period, we expect approximately 10.5 million additional shares to be delivered this March. This transaction followed a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program that was completed in July '07 and resulted in the repurchase of 16 million shares. As a result, we expect the share count at the end of the first quarter of 2008 to be approximately 510 million shares. On cash, in the fourth quarter, our cash balance... and this all relates to our capital flexibility. Cash balance decreased from 2.1... to $2.1 billion from $2.8 billion at the end of the third quarter. Excluding the tax payment on the Putnam transaction, cash increased by approximately $300 million in the quarter. Consequently, our debt balance was $3.9 billion at the end of 2007, a substantial decrease from our year-end 2006 debt of $5 billion. We will be utilizing cash on hand to repay $250 million in debt that matures later this week. And looking a bit out... out a bit further in 2008, in June, we will be funding the final installment of our payments to the compensation fund in the amount of $170 million. Net debt, which best represents our capital position and flexibility, was down to $1.7 billion at the end of 2007, a significant decrease from $3 billion at the end of 2006. The capital management activities we have completed over the last three years represent a significant de-leveraging of MMC's balance sheet. Net debt to capitalization ratios have decreased to 18% at the end of 2007, down significantly from 34% at the end of '06 and even higher in '05 and '04. In addition, due to the improvement in the funded status of our global defined benefit plan at year-end '07, the MMC's equity balance increased almost $1 billion at the end of last year. Finally, pardon me, for those if you may have missed it, in January, the Board announced a 5% increase in the dividend from $0.19 to $0.20 a share effective with the first quarter of 2008. And with that, let me turn it over to Dan for some information on Marsh.
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Marsh Inc.: Thank you, Matt. The first thing I would like to say it how thrilled I am to return to Marsh. I am excited about the opportunity of working with Brian and the team to significantly improve Marsh. Let me tell everyone a little about myself. I have been in the business for over 25 years, 18 year's on the brokerage side, and eight years on the underwriting side. I have run global specialties and I have run geographic regions as a broker and as an insurer. I am in international list. I have spent 50% of my career working outside of the Untied States. I began my insurance career right out of college joining Marsh as a broker in 1982. I worked at Marsh for a decade focusing on the energy sectors servicing top oil, chemical and energy accounts in New York, Saudi Arabia, and London. I have been a placement broker and the client executive. I dealt with some of the most complex issues faced by Marsh's major multinational client. I spent the next eight years at Willis, where I eventually served as President and Chief Operating Officer of Willis Risk Solutions, the large accounts practice of the Willis Group. Then in 2000, I joined AIG as the President of the Global Energy Division. I transferred to London in May 2002 as Managing Director of AIG Europe (UK) and became a Senior Vice President of AIG, Inc. in early 2007. So on coming back to Marsh I have come full circle. I have always had great affection for Marsh and its people and I truly understand its heritage and culture, its strength and its qualities. I relish the challenge of bringing Marsh back to the prominence and prestige it knew for decades and this desire is shared by my entire senior operating staff. When I first arrived I wanted to establish my senior management team and I proceeded to do that quickly, which was announced six weeks ago. I hired Joe McSweeney to be President of U.S./Canada. Joe worked at Marsh for more than 18 years from the mid-70s to the early 90s where he led the global utilities practice. His most recent position at Willis was as Chairman of Willis Risk Solutions. I chose Alex Moczarski to be President of our newly formed international division. He joined Marsh in 1993 from AIG. Alex advanced from being the Region Head for the Latin America and Caribbean operation to Head of International Specialty Operations to his most recent position as Chief Executive Officer of EMEA, our largest international region. I hired Sandy Vietor to be President of Marsh's Global Specialties. Sandy began his Marsh career in 1975 and spent the next 16 years here including as President of Marine and Energy. Most recently, he was Executive Vice President of Aon Risk Services Americas. I selected Tim Mahoney to lead the Global Risk Management unit, and to which our industry practices now report. He has been with Marsh since 1989 in a wide variety of senior executive positions dealing directly with clients. And I asked Hank Allen to continue as President of Global Consumer, which includes the firm's affinity and program management businesses as well as its private client services division. This management team has vast industry experience, both in the U.S. and abroad. We have experience running global geographies and global specialties, and have served clients both as brokers and as insures. And most importantly, we share the same passion and vision for what Marsh can be in the future. Our vision is to be the best insurance broker, intermediary, and risk advisor. I am currently in the process of assessing Marsh from many different angles. Let me give you some of my thoughts from my initial findings. Let's start with some good news, our clients list is very strong and I wouldn't switch our client base with any competitor. We have an excellent global footprint from which to service our multinational clients. We will certainly capture more value from this advantage in the near to mid-term. We have a talented and dedicated colleague base and in my view, noise around morale is way overdone. Staff morale is improving, a sign of this is voluntary turnover. Colleague turnover in 2007 improved to 12%, which is close to our historical level. Turnover among Managing Directors and Senior Vice Presidents also represented a return to historical levels at 6% in 2007. In 2007, we hired a significantly larger number of people at the senior ranks from competitors than we lost. We hired more than 300 officer positions from competitors and we lost approximately 200 for a net gain of more than 100. Our new business results are strong. We produced close to $900 million of new business in 2007. Our new business figure for 2007 on its own is equivalent to the size of the number 6 global broker. Many parts of our business, Continental Europe, Asia-Pacific, Canada, Latin America, Middle East and Africa, and Consumer are performing well with double-digit margins. So in my view we have a terrific client base, the right global footprint, and high quality colleagues. The issue is we don't make enough money, which brings me to my near-term plans. It's back to basics. In 1982, when I first started working at Marsh, my dad who ran a small art supply business gave me one important piece of advice. He said I should always think and behave like an owner. I have carried this advice through my career and this approach will take hold at Marsh. The purpose of Marsh is to serve clients; therefore, our strategies will be geared to those things which benefit clients and the colleagues that serve clients. Of course, we must do this profitably. I am moving swiftly to simplify the organizational structure, streamline reporting lines and drive profitability. Let's talk about profitability. The principal challenges relate to the U.S. and to a lesser extent the UK, although we will ultimately improve margins everywhere. We are focusing on both revenues and expenses. I believe that we can create additional revenue from better segmentation strategies, particularly in the smaller lower middle-market segment, and revenue initiatives such as reviewing our pricing of services approach, improving client retention, and our enhanced commission initiative, as well as evaluating placement hubs in the U.S. We are also focused on reducing costs and expense management. We continue to implement the cost savings initiatives identified in the fourth quarter of 2007. As previously discussed, these are overwhelmingly corporate costs and the savings are expected to be approximately $125 million. In addition, we still expect to see substantial year-over-year savings in pension, benefits, and other one-time costs, which together with the $125 million in initiatives will result in over $200 million of savings on a year-over-year basis. Keep in mind, as previously discussed, these savings will be offset to some extent by increased salary and compensation costs as we continue to compete for talent. These and other expense controls we plan to put into place target the nice to haves rather than the need to haves. We will make changes to organizational alignment, processes, standards, and technology in a thoughtful manner. While that will take me and my management team time to achieve improvements in all of these areas, we are already operating as a cohesive management team, speaking as one voice on a global basis with a very simple message. Working together, we will successfully increase the focus on clients, reduce operating expenses, reward superior performance for all... for our colleagues, and improve profitability to shareholders. We are already moving to improve profitability by aligning and simplifying the organization, establishing P&Ls on a more decentralized basis, empowering our best P&L managers to make decisions with accountability for results, and instilling disciplined expense management and fostering a culture where we all think like an owner. These improvements will allow us to invest in our colleagues, our core strength, and to increase returns for shareholders. In summary, I am confident that we will deliver exceptional client value and drive profitability and growth by capitalizing on our global reach, market expertise, and outstanding people. These are just my initial observations in the two months I have been here, but I can tell you I am very optimistic that we will be a firm of formidable strength in the future. With that, I will turn it back to Brian.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Dan. Before we get into responding to your questions, I want to make a few remarks about the company, the results, and the priorities I see shaping up as MMC's new CEO. It's obvious that the company on a whole is underperforming and there are problems that must be addressed. If that weren't the case, I wouldn't be here today. At the same time, the problems are not systemic; many parts of MMC are working quite well. As a new CEO, I am in the assessment phase. I need time to assess our businesses, our people, and make what I believe to be appropriate decisions to ensure improvement over time. While I want to fully understand the task before me, I also intend to move as quickly as feasible to gather the information and knowledge I need, working with the business leaders and then take action. That said, there are some obvious issues that need to be addressed. These are areas that have been raised as concerns by our larger shareholders as well and as such they should be our first priorities for 2008. The first priority is to ensure the recovery of Marsh in a sustainable manner over a reasonable period of time. As I said before, we're very fortunate to have Dan at the helm of Marsh. He too is in the process of evaluation of building his plan as you already heard. As Dan said, there are fundamental issues that need to be addressed in Marsh. We need to dramatically improve the cost structure and we need to simplify how we work. While I will be there to help, it's not my job to lead Marsh, it's Dan's job. My job is to support Dan and the Marsh leadership team he is building and to support the Marsh professionals around the world. The second priority for me is Kroll. It's a business that has shown both volatility and overall disappointing performance. I am digging into Kroll to understand its parts and how they relate to each other. My objective is to have a clear decision about the future of Kroll soon. The third priority is MMC's corporate organization. There can be a value-added role for a corporate center in MMC, but I see that role as a relatively focused and limited one. The primary role for corporate is to support the operating companies and to enable the corporation to function. I am going to see that this balance is achieved. As I said, this is a first cut at priorities with all the wisdom that two weeks provide, and I will continue to access, learn, and identify what we need to do to improve our performance. Finally, I wanted to talk a bit about my broader philosophy. As you know, I am by nature a builder. And I want to grow MMC. I see growth and specifically profitable growth as good for our clients, to our colleagues, and our shareholders and we need to get back to growing both organically and otherwise. As we work on fixing the fundamentals of our individual businesses, we need to pay attention to the performance of the corporation as a whole. It means that we will continue to look at the portfolio. We should be building a set of businesses that fit strategically, we should not be holding on to things for the sake of holding on to them. And at the same time, we will look to add capabilities through acquisition or otherwise where it make sense. My objective is to build and lead a team that can provide true sustained, long-term value for the shareholders by having a vision, making decisions, and then executing well. Those of who you known me know my track record and I believe it can be done here and will be done here. I am excited about the opportunity, thrilled to be here and inpatient to get on with it. So now let's hear your questions. Go ahead operator. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Keith Walsh, Citigroup.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup: Hi, good morning everybody.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Keith.
Keith Walsh - Citigroup: First question for Dan. Just kind of thinking about the rate of change on improving brokerage margins, we are seeing some real high margin revenues such as reinsurance and RCH on the decline and then on top of that you got PC prices declining as well and maybe if you could just comment on that? And I've got a follow-up for Matt.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Dan?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Marsh Inc.: Okay. Well, I mean, you are right about PC rates declining and I don't really see anything on the horizon right now that will challenge that. But having said that, the basic business within Marsh, there are several revenue initiatives that we can take. For example, our segmentation strategies and marketing approach in these small and lower middle market segments, I think we can generate additional revenue from. I would like to consider placement hubs in the U.S. That would do several things. One, it would enable us to capture aggregate placement power for our clients, it would offer significant efficiency gains to insurers for which we would expect to receive revenue and it would reduce our E&O exposure. The other thing that we can do much better is getting back to basics in serving our clients, and I think that holding on to existing clients is always very important and the quickest way of building revenue, but having said that, we need to tighten up our pricing of services a bit to make sure that we are getting the right revenue for the quality work that we provide.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Keith, you had a question for Matt?
Keith Walsh - Citigroup: Yes, and I just wanted to follow-up on... you mentioned the pension expense, maybe if you can just give us details on really what that was '07 over '06 and what do you think that's going to trend in '08? Thanks.
Matthew B. Bartley - Chief Financial Officer: Well, Keith, we don't disclose the quantum of pension expense, but as you know, it has driven significantly by the size of the liability. I mean, it is a service cost based calculation, but the size of the liability bears directly on that and embedded within that of course is the discount rate. We benefited significantly in the U.S. and the UK at year-end as discount rates rose, which will play through to our pension expense in 2008.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. We will hear from Charlie Gates next.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Charlie.
Charles Gates - Credit Suisse: Hi. It's nice to hear your voice again, Brian.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Same here. Good to hear your voice.
Charles Gates - Credit Suisse: In your prepared remarks, you indicated in the... I wasn't sure what period you'd be coming to a clear decision about the future of Kroll. You also later, I believe, made the comment you won't hold on to things for the sake of holding on to them. Could you speak to what you indicated in those remarks or elaborate on that?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure, Charlie, sure. In my remarks about holding onto things is that it was more of a general remark, it's my philosophy and I think that if you are looking at a portfolio of assets, you are constantly looking to see whether they collectively make sense and things might made sense in the past and they don't going forward. So you never should be hesitant to prune the portfolio. That's what I was talking about. And I wanted to further make sure everybody understands that you can add as well as subtract. It's... that's the process. Hopefully you add more than you subtract, right? A far as Kroll is concerned, you heard from Matt what the results were for the quarter. I am not trying to signal that Kroll is for sale, but I am saying that I am looking at Kroll and I am looking at it in depth and I am looking at the component parts of Kroll and how it's organized, and I will make a decision about the pieces in the hole as it fits all of Marsh in due coarse, but it clearly deserves my attention and that's what I was trying to tell everybody.
Charles Gates - Credit Suisse: Thank you.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Charlie. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Jay Gelb with Lehman Brothers.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Thanks and good morning.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Jay.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: On a big picture view, taking into account you've only been there for a few weeks, what where the biggest surprises you have seen in the MMC franchise, both positive and negative?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Biggest surprises, this morale things and look at... it's tough to work in a situation where you are constantly hearing the negatives, but the situation here is actually I think coming around, and I think Dan and his group have a lot to do with it. So I think certainly that has been a pleasant surprise that there really is underlying strength, and I think the desire to move forward. I knew that there was a strong group, don't get me wrong. But an attitude issue was good to see that there is very strong positive attitude to move ahead and I think it's a great group of people. So that's a formidable combination. I do think that structurally... and I am speaking now again of Marsh and Dan talked about simplifying it, it really needs to be looked at in a new way, the world's change and I think these guys recognize that the world has changed, and therefore that structurally there has to be some changes made that really simplify the business and recognize the kind of world we live in today in the brokerage business. So a little bit of a surprise about the needs there, but, look at I am... first of all, I am an optimist by nature, but there is a lot of optimistic about here. Okay, Jay, anything else you want to ask?
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Yes, I guess, for Dan, in terms of margins within risk and insurance services, on an adjusted basis, they probably deteriorated about 400 bps down to about 11% adjusted for the full year 2007. Where do you think you can get risk and insurance margins over time taking into account the headwinds of a soft market?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Marsh Inc.: Well, I would like to address it this way rather than give any kind of specific percentage. I would let you know, Jay, that I have absolutely no doubt that I will significantly improve the margins of the Marsh business and that is irrespective of the market environment and the headwinds that you referenced.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Jay. Why don't we take another question?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Alain Karaoglan.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Alain?
Alain Karaoglan - Banc of America Securities: and gentlemen, we are very thrilled to have you as well, Brian and Dan. And my question is the following. And Dan, you have identified well that Marsh has tremendous attributes and great characteristics, but the problem was there is not a lot of profitability flowing to the bottom line. Do you have an idea on when you will be more comfortable in looking at the margin and being able to say this is an enterprise that should get margins of X relative to what it has been achieving because improving from very weak results is easy even improving significantly, but getting back to where we were historically is a big achievement and in order to do so, it seems to me that just arithmetically the revenue have to grow significant and gain market share.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, Al, I think you... it's simple. I mean, the execution is the hard part. And I assume you are asking me and not Dan, although Dan is probably better at answering this question, but I think as he pointed out, he can't do it simply by expense reduction, he can't do that. It's not going to work. There is only so much you can cut. And I think as I understand what Dan wants to do; there is a simplification of the business process. In other words, expenses ought to follow from how you organized, right? You just don't cut, slash, and burn. But most importantly, I think he has revenue generation initiatives that coupled with an appropriate organization structure gets you to where you want to go. Now, where the margins lead you is where the margins lead you. I think we want to be the best out there in terms of our margins and that's really the goal. Dan, do you want add anything to that?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Marsh Inc.: I would just add that there are several parts of the business that are actually performing well and where we would intend to improve the margins still in those businesses. The fundamental issue that we have is the United States organization and to a lesser extent the UK. In large part, the U.S. organization has been somewhat rooted in the past and I think that with a new management team very much focused on what Marsh can be in the future and less concerned with what legacy looks like within Marsh. I'm very comfortable that we would able to grow top line as well as expense, but we shouldn't underestimate the expense impact. I mean, I think that this was an organization in large part that made decisions on a lot of nice to haves and there is not a day that goes by that we don't find additional savings that can be viewed as just clearly in the nice to have category. And so, I am quite comfortable that we will find additional areas of expense without touching the fundamental client facing areas of the business.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Alain. We will take another question.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Brian Meredith.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Brian?
Brian Meredith - UBS: Hi, Brian.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Brian.
Brian Meredith - UBS: One quick numbers question just quickly, FX, any impact on earnings in the quarter?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Matt?
Matthew B. Bartley - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, we had a bit of FX impact on earnings probably to some degree commensurate with what you saw on the revenue line, but that's only a trend because obviously the... both on revenue and expense, we had significant impact, as expected, with the weakness in the dollar.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Right. So, bottom line there was an earnings impact, positive impact?
Matthew B. Bartley - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, there was a marginal positive impact from FX on the earnings line, correct.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Great. Thanks. And then Dan, you talked... mentioned a couple of times trying to get the right revenues of services, I guess on that comment, one, have you had any success getting additional commission rates that was something that was talked about in the last quarter? And in addition to that, you talked about trying to get revenue growth, are you willing actually to may be temporarily in the near-term lose revenues in order to get the right profitability for accounts?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Marsh Inc.: Let me start with the second one first. Profitability is our key metric. We will drive profitability and we have no interest on working on business which is unprofitable. And so if we need to drop revenue in order to achieve profitability, that's a trade we would make every day. Now, in terms of the... specifically on the enhanced commission initiative, we're engaged in discussions with individual carriers now. The significance of the revenue I can't determine yet. I don't think it will be anything more than modest in 2008 although I do think in future years we could see some substantial benefit.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Right. Thank you.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Brian. Next question?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Small with Bear Stearns.
David Small - Bear Stearns: Good morning.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, David.
David Small - Bear Stearns: Dan, when you talk about streamlining or simplifying the Marsh business, should we expect a more detailed restructuring plan in the coming quarters and also do you think the plan would have significant charges associated with it?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Marsh Inc.: I think it's a little early for me to comment on that because I have really... even though I am a veteran according to Brian, it's been two months, but speaking frankly, we are going out to do an awful lot of things to get our margin back to a more acceptable levels, and I would fully expect as we move through this year we'll be talking about actions and potential realignments that will drive margin improvement in the future. We are working on things now, but our plans are way too preliminary, I think, to discuss in this forum.
David Small - Bear Stearns: And then maybe I could just ask a follow-up to Michele, just quickly may be if you can discuss the consulting business and how it would respond in a weaker economic environment? Thank you.
M. Michele Burns - Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer of Mercer: Sure, be glad to. What I'll tell you is that as you heard, we finished 2007 very strong on the consulting segment. Practically in the first month or so we see some softening, particularly in the United State, and we are taking action against that, but we are also watching very closely because it's really not material and don't forget we have a very balanced portfolio. So at this stage, our US revenues are... we have a little bit over 50% of the business. So we are watching it closely, we know where our levers are, but at this stage I can't tell you that it's a bad... very bad answer. John, do you want to follow up on that too?
John Drzik - President and Chief Executive Officer of Oliver Wyman Group: Yes, sure. In Oliver Wyman, we also finished the year very strong. So right through December, demand for our services was very strong. And as you saw from the fourth quarter results, looking at 2008, we are seeing some weakening of demand for services, particularly in those segments tied to the financial markets crisis such as our North American financial services consulting business, but we are still not seeing any broad drop in demand, but as Michele indicated, just as in Mercer, in Oliver Wyman we're watching this very closely and monitoring to see if we need to make any adjustments as time moves forward.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, David. Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with Stifel Nicolaus.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Good morning, all. Dan, let me start by thanking you for the extensive detail you provided. If we look at the brokerage segment and we adjust for the non-recurring expenses and we take out Risk Capital Holdings, we still saw margins drop a little bit on a year-over-year basis. Is there any unusual compensation built into the quarter?
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I am going to let Matt... I didn't hear your name, I am sorry.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: It's Meyer Shields.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Meyer, okay. Matt is going to take that one, okay?
Matthew B. Bartley - Chief Financial Officer: No, the other piece that you should also recognize, Meyer, is the impact on the reinsurance side of the business. So, clearly the market conditions combined with the fact that seasonality applies to margins in the quarter does have an affect, which is just the other component that you need to recognize.
Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Right, that would be in last...your fourth quarter also.
Matthew B. Bartley - Chief Financial Officer: Right.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, thank you. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from William Wilt with Morgan Stanley.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Hi, good morning and best of luck to the new management team.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hey, thanks a lot. We are just not picking up the names. So I didn't pick --
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Sure, it's Bill Wilt from Morgan Stanley.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Oh, Bill, hey, hi.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: And best of luck.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks. I wanted to know who is saying it, thank you very much. I appreciate it.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Of course. It's a question for you, Brian. I guess, the Marsh margin have been talked about a lot. So, I will put that on the backburner. You mentioned at the outset that you have been a user of Marsh services throughout the career. What's your big-picture perspective on the portfolio of businesses from a cross-selling perspective as you think about now managing them, having been a user of many different facets over the years, is that a near-term opportunity, is it further out in your management plan, just kind of scoping that would be helpful.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Bill. As you pointed out, I have been a recipient of the fine services of Marsh and Carpenter. I've hired Mercer in the past. So I guess I've been cross-sold. And certainly cross-selling is there and something that we should work on. I guess I'd put it this way. To me the individual operating companies really need to develop their marketing plans, they have to have their approach to their customer base aggressively and intelligently developed. And then, if we can add to that cross-selling I think that's the way to go. I think that's terrific. But to me, the most important thing is the individuals' approach to their client base. Having said that, there is also kind of at MMC an interesting collection of capabilities. And so, there are not that many companies out there that can... if you got a problem to solve, and put the kind of expertise together to solve problems... problems... think about problems, they are always a little different than the past ones. So, unique combinations of assets apply to a problem usually wins the favor of the customers. So we have that ability. So that's another thing that needs to be worked on. But first things first. Let's get the individual guys working on there, on their own marketing. Okay?
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Thanks again. Best of luck.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, thank you. Appreciate it. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Matthew Heimermann with J.P. Morgan.
Matthew Heimermann - J. P. Morgan: Hi, good morning everyone.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Matt.
Matthew Heimermann - J. P. Morgan: Quick question. You talked about getting people think more like owner; does that imply that potentially we should think about employees getting a greater percentage of stock compensation going forward?
Matthew B. Bartley - Chief Financial Officer: Matthew, I think Dan said that. So do you want to answer that, Dan?
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Marsh Inc.: Yes.
Matthew Heimermann - J. P. Morgan: Fair enough.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: I believe it too, but we will let Dan answer.
Daniel S. Glaser - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Marsh Inc.: Well, there is a couple of things. One, I do think that having colleagues owning stock makes for healthier corporate environment. So that is certainly true. But, hey, growing profitability is the quickest way to increase variable comp, whether that's stock-based or cash-based. And so the best way for us to create more pool to provide stock to employees is by growing profitability. And so that's what we will be focused on doing, but in an overall sense, I would love if we had a wide share of employee stock participation.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, Matt, as you started with me, let me put my two cents into it and I think Dan hit it on the head, which is when you are thinking like an owner, yes, there's compensation involved, and stock ownership is principal way of looking at that. But it's a philosophical thing. It's believing in the company, it's believing when you come to work everyday that this is the... that it does good work and you are part of it and you believe in the leadership and you are winning, everybody wants to win. So, thinking like an owner is ensuring that everybody around you is operating in the same way. It's what owners do, it's to try to get their colleagues working. So it's more of a philosophical comment that Dan made, but there are some ramifications to it in terms of stock ownership. Is it okay?
Matthew Heimermann - J. P. Morgan: Yes, that fair. Jus a quick follow-up for Matt on the reinsurance side, you said fac is 10% of the business. I just was curious what the mix is in 4Q because if I let my mind wonder that would imply that you had a 50% decline there to drive basically 4% overall decline. So I just was curious... I am guessing it's maybe a bigger mix in 4Q, just wanted to put that in perspective.
Matthew B. Bartley - Chief Financial Officer: I am sorry, your question is specifically in Q4?
Matthew Heimermann - J. P. Morgan: Well, you specific... well, I'd be curious, yes, specifically what was happening in 4Q and what the mix was there, so... because otherwise if I assume it's equal treaty and fac, then it implies kind of a 50% decline in fac.
Matthew B. Bartley - Chief Financial Officer: Well, I think you have picked up on the point, which is why I was emphasizing the fact that Q4 is so light. The hit in facultative gets exacerbated in Q4 because it is of course such a light quarter. And... but the reference to the size of fac is more on a rolling annualized basis. So I am not going to give you... break out the Q4 numbers, but you can trust that there was exacerbation in Q4 as a consequence of the light seasonality in that quarter.
Matthew Heimermann - J. P. Morgan: Can you just give us order of magnitude?
Matthew B. Bartley - Chief Financial Officer: I could, but I think I won't.
Matthew Heimermann - J. P. Morgan: All right. I just wanted to have people avoid from annualizing an unusual number, but if you can't quantify it for us, I guess we can help ourselves.
Matthew B. Bartley - Chief Financial Officer: That's a good point Matt, yes, thanks.
Matthew Heimermann - J. P. Morgan: All right.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Matt. I think, operator, we will take two more questions. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time.
Brian Duperreault - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I take no more questions then, okay. Well, thank you very much for your attention and we will be talking to you. Thank you. Bye.
Operator: That concludes today's conference, ladies and gentlemen. We appreciate your attendance and have a great day.
